The New York Times,2019-08-27,"In Hong Kong , Photo Evokes Tiananmen",573 ,"
One man wore a white shirt and black trousers, and carried two shopping bags. He stared down a tank.
The other wore shorts and a tank top, and carried a furled umbrella. He stared down a police officer who had a weapon drawn. 
  The two photos are drawing comparisons as compelling images of outmatched citizens standing up to Chinese authority.
  The first photo was taken in Beijing in 1989 during the Tiananmen Square protests, which were brutally quashed by the government. The protester, who quickly became known as Tank Man, captured the world's attention. And the iconic photo has endured 30 years after the Tiananmen crackdown.
  The second was taken on Sunday in Hong Kong by a photographer for The New York Times, Lam Yik Fei, as the local police clashed again with protesters in the semiautonomous Chinese territory. The photograph of the protests, now in their third month, has resonated on social media and been shared thousands of times. To many people, the image evokes memories of Tiananmen.
  Mr. Lam is one of the few photographers for a Western news outlet who has been covering the protests in Hong Kong from the beginning. He was there when protesters stormed the airport and the train stations, and when they were attacked by mysterious masked men.
  David Furst, The Times's international picture editor, said Mr. Lam has deep sources among the protesters, and has followed their movements closely. That shows, he said, in the comprehensive nature of his coverage.
  On Sunday, Mr. Lam said, he was just trying to to stay on top of events.
  Violence had broken out after a peaceful march, where many protesters carried umbrellas, a symbol of the resistance movement. Hong Kong police officers drew pistols on protesters who were charging them with sticks, and one officer fired a warning shot into the air after another officer fell.
  As Mr. Lam looked on, the protester in shorts and a tank top approached one officer and dropped to his knees.
  ''He said, 'Don't shoot,''' the photographer said.
  The officer did not shoot -- but did kick the man in the torso, knocking him over.
  The photograph Mr. Lam took was made a moment later, after the protester stood back up and backed away, umbrella in hand.
  Mak Chin-ho, the assistant commissioner for police operations, said the officers on the scene ''demonstrated great restraint,'' calling their response necessary and reasonable during a volatile situation in which their lives ''were in great danger.''
  ''During that critical moment, this man suddenly appeared in front,'' he said, referring specifically to the episode in which the officer pointed his weapon at the man with the umbrella. ''Understandably, he appeared as a threat.''
  No one knows what happened to the man who confronted the tank in Tiananmen in 1989. Even his name has remained a mystery, at least to the general public. Some believe that he must have been executed, others that he might have been spared.
  The name of the Hong Kong protester is not known, either. But it appears he is still safe. Mr. Lam saw him slip away after the crowd dispersed.
  Mr. Lam, a 33-year-old Hong Kong native, said he has photographed worse conflicts elsewhere. But it feels different when it is in one's own home.
  ''I covered protests in other countries before,'' he said, ''but I never imagined it would happen in Hong Kong.''
  This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.         "
The New York Times ,2019-08-30,"In Hong Kong , Playing Tennis With Tear-Gas Grenades",908 ,"
“If we die, well, we were going to die anyway.”
HONG KONG – President Trump has called the pro-democracy protests here  and China has in effect denounced participants as            .
Yet even when chaos reigns during clashes with the police, protesters clean up litter from the battlefield. Medics stand by to assist those injured. Crowds part like the Red Sea to let ambulances through. Tennis players bring their rackets: When the police fire tear-gas grenades, they lob them back.
Television footage may focus on angry young protesters hurling Molotov cocktails, and they are real; I believe the violence is a mistake that increases the risk of a crackdown. But the vast majority of protesters are nonviolent and simply yearn for this great city to enjoy freedom to match its modernity.
“If we didn’t protest, this might become just another Chinese city,” one young woman told me.
A 25-year-old university student told me: “We are like a frog in a beaker of water that is being boiled, and we’re trying to jump out. If we die, well, we were going to die anyway.”
The risks to protesters are increasing, for Hong Kong and China are orchestrating a crackdown — what some democracy figures are calling a “white terror.” The police have arrested more than 900 people so far, and just in the last few days leading figures were arrested while others were attacked by thugs, in one case with a cleaver and baseball bat.
One of the best-known democracy advocates is Denise Ho, a famous Cantonese pop singer. As we sat down in a coffee shop, the server encouraged her with a “ga yao,” the Cantonese equivalent of, “Keep it up!”
As a result of Ho’s activism, she is now a nonperson on the Chinese mainland. Not only is her music banned there, her name can’t even be written on social media.
“It’s never been like this before in Hong Kong,” she told me, noting that China seems to be pressuring companies to fire staff members who support the protests.  airline is among those that have done so.
“Hong Kong people don’t like to fight on the streets,” she said. “But they’ve pushed us to the edge.”
China’s president, Xi Jinping, is confronted here by a challenge that he can’t easily steamroll, and there’s no obvious exit ramp for either side. And if Xi can’t manage to keep Hong Kong content, how can he dream of unifying with Taiwan?
So look out. Xi is intolerant and overconfident, thus one risk is that he will ultimately deploy the People’s Armed Police, a paramilitary force, to crush the protests. Alternatively, he can use Hong Kong’s triad gangsters — who have  of working for Beijing — to use cleavers and baseball bats to terrorize or eliminate democracy activists, even as the Hong Kong police step up their own arrests. We should be alert not only for troops pouring across the border, but also for thugs with cleavers.
One concern is that Xi may make decisions based on bad information relayed by sycophants. In my conversations here, I sense that pro-China officials actually believe that the protests were orchestrated by American and Taiwan officials, and it’s always dangerous when dictators become persuaded by .
In addition, Chinese news coverage of the protests has resulted in a wave of anti-Hong Kong nationalism on the mainland that may add to the pressure to suppress protesters. In fairness, mainlanders do make one valid point: If protesters in America were throwing Molotov cocktails at police officers, the United States might well have seen more than the single warning shot fired by the police so far in Hong Kong.
This great city may be at a turning point, and Trump and other world leaders should make clearer that Xi will pay a severe price if he uses force — whether by troops or by triads — to try to crush Hong Kong. Granted this must be done delicately, because publicly siding with protesters risks confirming Xi’s narrative that America is secretly steering the movement.
One helpful step would be for Congress to pass the bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which would sanction officials who suppress freedoms in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong is one of the great cities of the world, and I have been in love with it ever since I lived here in the mid-1980s as a foreign correspondent for The Times. This city is resilient, and no one has ever made money for long betting against Hong Kong. But today it is at risk.
It is at risk from Chinese encroachment and the slow erosion of the rule of law, and from the danger that Xi will eventually resort to force to crush the democracy movement. A military crackdown would be a catastrophe for freedom, for China and Hong Kong alike, and for the world economy.
Many Americans don’t even bother to vote, while Hong Kongers shame us by enduring tear gas and threats of job dismissals in hopes of attaining what we take for granted.
These huge throngs on the Hong Kong streets are composed not of terrorists but of people who deserve ballots but may yet end up with bullets. The outcome may depend partly on whether we stand with them.

The New York Times,2019-06-19,Top Leader in Hong Kong Apologizes for Bill That Set Off Huge Protests,1056 ,"
HONG KONG -- Backpedaling under mounting pressure, Hong Kong's top leader publicly apologized on Tuesday for having proposed contentious legislation that would allow extraditions to mainland China.
''I offer my most sincere apology to all people of Hong Kong,'' the leader, Carrie Lam, said at a news conference at government headquarters. 
  ''I've still got much to learn and do in better balancing diverse interests, in listening more to all walks of life and in taking our society forward,'' she added.
  Mrs. Lam, who had already announced the extradition bill's indefinite suspension, did not concede to protesters' demands that it be withdrawn entirely. But she said that as long as there were public disputes over its contents, legislative work on it would not be resumed.
  She also said that she would not resign as Hong Kong's chief executive, but acknowledged that ''as for my governance in the future, it will be difficult.''
  Mrs. Lam was trying to strike a difficult balance on Tuesday, showing contrition to protesters without further giving in to their demands. She avoided antagonizing the Chinese leaders who appointed her by taking the blame for the legislation herself, not mentioning Beijing's support for it. She also tried to express concern for injured protesters without undercutting the Hong Kong police, whose use of force has added to public anger.
  About 100 people gathered on Tuesday outside the offices of the central government and listened as Mrs. Lam's words boomed from a loudspeaker. Many booed as she spoke.
  Samuel Chan, an electronics trader, said he did not believe Mrs. Lam was listening to the protesters.
  ''They are just responding to the issue according to a government mind-set,'' said Mr. Chan, 56. ''Not the people's will.''
  Mrs. Lam faces broad public anger following three large-scale demonstrations over the past 10 days by protesters fearful that the extradition bill would encroach on their civil liberties. Even after her announcement on Saturday that the legislation was being suspended indefinitely, protesters turned out the next day in larger numbers than ever, with organizers providing an unverified estimate of close to two million of the territory's seven million residents.
  The extradition bill would make it easier for Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory, to send people suspected of crimes to jurisdictions with which it does not have extradition agreements. That would include mainland China, where the judicial system is notoriously opaque and under the tight control of the ruling Communist Party.
  Opponents worry that if the bill were to become law, anyone in the city could potentially be sent to the mainland, including dissidents.
  Sunday evening, the Hong Kong government responded to the march with a conciliatory written statement that ended with a rare apology from Mrs. Lam, who is known for almost never backing down in a fight.
  Neither that apology nor the one on Tuesday was enough to satisfy Mrs. Lam's critics, many of whom have called for her to withdraw the bill outright and resign. As long as it is merely suspended, experts say, the approval process could be quickly restarted at any time in the Hong Kong legislature, which is controlled by pro-Beijing lawmakers.
  The Civil Human Rights Front, one of the broader groups that helped organize the recent protests, said on Tuesday evening that it still wanted Mrs. Lam to resign.
  A bigger priority for the group, however, is that the government drop all charges against those who were arrested during the protests.
  The police have arrested at least 32 people since Wednesday, when a demonstration outside the Hong Kong legislature turned violent. A group of protesters attempting to storm the building threw umbrellas and other objects at the police, who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.
  The Hong Kong police commissioner, Lo Wai-chung, said on Monday that the government would pursue rioting charges against five people accused of being involved in the violence. Protesters had objected to his earlier characterization of the Wednesday protest as a riot.
  On Tuesday, Mrs. Lam did not elaborate on Mr. Lo's remarks except to say that those who protested peacefully would not face legal action.
  Her remarks represented the clearest apology for a major public initiative by any chief executive of Hong Kong since Britain returned sovereignty over the territory to China in 1997. Tung Chee-hwa, the territory's first chief executive, did not apologize in 2003 when he shelved Beijing-backed national security legislation that would have allowed warrantless police searches and the closing of newspapers deemed seditious.
  The extradition fight has been compared to the one under Mr. Tung, who stayed in office for 21 more months but did not finish his term. Those who say Ms. Lam should resign are not willing to wait that long.
  ''Carrie has apologized but refuses to budge on withdrawing the bill and resigning,'' Anson Chan, a democracy advocate who was Hong Kong's second-highest official until her retirement in 2001, said on Tuesday. ''It seems every concession has to be dragged out of her.''
  Some democracy activists are quietly nervous about the possibility of a resignation by Mrs. Lam, a lifelong civil servant, because her political heir apparent, Paul Chan, has a reputation for being even more strongly pro-Beijing.
  Others are adamant that Mrs. Lam step down. They contend that the Hong Kong public should press for full and free elections rather than accept the current system, in which a pro-Beijing committee of fewer than 1,200 people selects the chief executive.
  Protesters made similar demands for open elections five years ago, when they occupied major roadways for almost three months in what is known as the Umbrella Movement. While that movement did not achieve its short-term objectives, it had a major influence on this year's anti-extradition protests.
  Emily Lau, a former chairwoman of the Democratic Party who is still an influential voice on democracy issues, said the politics of Mr. Chan, the financial secretary, should not deter critics from calling for Mrs. Lam's resignation.
  ''It would be a disaster to have him as chief executive,'' Ms. Lau said. ''But we should not say, 'Because we don't want Paul Chan, maybe Carrie should stay.'''"
The New York Times,2019-09-03,Bringing Activism to Hong Kong 's Schools,1235 ,"
HONG KONG -- High school students in Hong Kong starting the new school year on Monday arrived to class wearing gas masks and joined hands to form human chains. University undergraduates held a strike, waved flags and chanted protest slogans.
After a summer of demonstrating in the streets, outside municipal offices and in the airport, students refuted the government's wishful assertion that once they returned to school the months of pro-democracy protests that have roiled the city would come to an end. 
  ''The government thinks it can quell the movement when students return to school, because we can only come out during the summer,'' said Owen Lo, 16, a high school student. ''But that's not true.''
  He said he was afraid of the repercussions he and other students might face but ''seeing so many students selflessly gambling their future to express their demands to the government, it is infectious, and makes me want to come out and do something for Hong Kong.''
  Students who gathered at a plaza near the Central Business District were joined by thousands of workers holding a concurrent strike, exemplifying the multigenerational makeup of the protests.
  ''Through these peaceful activities, many citizens are coming out to show their comrades on the front lines that public opinion has not turned against them,'' said Peter Chui, a 24-year-old engineer.
  Hundreds of thousands of people have joined protests that began in June to oppose an unpopular bill that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be extradited to mainland China for trial. As the summer unfolded, the protesters' demands grew to include a call for universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into accusations of police brutality. The protests have also become more violent, as a core group of demonstrators -- many of them high school and university students -- have fought with the police and damaged symbols of Chinese authority.
  Police officers attacked unarmed demonstrators inside a subway station on Saturday, and protesters on Sunday disrupted transit for thousands of travelers at Hong Kong's international airport, the seventh-busiest in the world.
  Tensions on Monday, the first day of school for many students, ran high. Police officers monitored the student protests and riot police officers were deployed to subway stations -- a sign of the fears that the weekend's tumultuous protests would continue onto campuses. But the activism Monday morning remained peaceful.
  High school students around the territory protested in various ways across campuses, reflecting the diversity of the movement. They wore black shirts or eye patches to commemorate a first-aid volunteer who recently lost an eye to a projectile shot by the police. Others studied in the library or designated classrooms rather than participate in normal classes.
  A group of secondary school students from St. Francis' Canossian College, the alma mater of the city's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, carried signs and donned construction helmets or gas masks, gear typically saved for more violent protests. One sign read: ''Chief Executive, will you listen to the voices of the younger sisters from your school?''
  Tens of thousands of students from schools and universities across the city crammed the central commons on the campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong to listen to speeches from professors, lawyers and student protesters.
  Education and government officials said they were opposed to class boycotts in any form, saying in a letter to teachers that schools should remain politically neutral places.
  ''Schools are absolutely not places for presenting political views or demands,'' Matthew Cheung, the city's chief secretary, said at a news conference Monday.
  Boycotts, he said, would disrupt normal classes, ''extending the turmoil we see in society to the peaceful environments of school.'' He added, ''This holds no benefits for the mood of students as they study, or for the healthy growth of our next generation.''
  When asked why police officers had showed up at high schools, the education secretary, Kevin Yeung, said protests held by ''unknown people'' outside schools could not be treated like boycotts on campuses.
  ''The schools clarified that they did not call the police,'' he said. ''When people see police in a place with a lot of people, they want to maintain order and ensure public safety.'' He said officers should not be seen as a threat.

  Many striking students said they had exhausted other avenues of protests and that class boycotts were the most peaceful way of resistance. Some emphasized in a statement the principle of ''boycotting classes but continuing to learn,'' by more directly engaging in current affairs and in civic lessons.
  ''This is more important than school,'' said Krystal Hung, a university student who planned to boycott classes in the short term. ''I can catch up on studies on my own even if I'd skipped classes. And if I don't come out this time, I may not have another chance in the future.''
  Jessie Cheung, a 17-year-old high school student, said she felt drained after splitting her summer between attending protests and studying for college entrance exams. She has not skipped a single march since the movement began during her exams in June, she said.
  ''It all adds up. I'm getting more tired and with the start of school, there will be more things to worry about,'' she said. ''On the one hand, I have to care about my grades, and on the other, I need to perform my civic duty.''
  [How demonstrations in Hong Kong have evolved, with changing tactics and goals.]
  The Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union, which has a history of supporting pro-democracy protests, said in a statement that while its members believed that undergraduates had the maturity to decide whether to strike, the group would neither organize nor endorse high school class boycotts.
  Ip Kin-yuen, the vice-president of the union and a lawmaker who represents the education sector, said he encouraged schools to accommodate the wishes of high school students boycotting classes within schools.
  Karen Yong, a 52-year-old teacher, said that she would follow the instructions of the school authorities but felt helpless after watching students protest all summer without achieving their goals.
  ''In this social climate, I don't know what to tell my students. You could be very authentic, serious and engaged with society, but what happens to you could be quite tragic,'' Ms. Yong said, referring to the arrests of protesters and prominent activists and lawmakers. ''In the end, I may just have to tell them to get good test results, and find a good job and make good money -- that's all. Is that the point of education?''
  Joshua Wong, a prominent 22-year-old activist whose activism as a secondary student played a prominent role in citywide protests, said that class boycotts represented the most peaceful forms of resistance against Beijing.
  ''When we can't see the future of our society, how can we see our personal future and our personal career?'' he said in a phone interview. The class boycotts were not the ''starting point and not the end point'' of the protest movement, he added. ''It just shows how our momentum keeps going forward.''

The New York Times,2019-07-10,"Hong Kong Leader Retreats, Calling Extradition Bill 'Dead'",1230 ,"
HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's embattled leader, Carrie Lam, made her most emphatic promise yet on Tuesday that a contentious extradition bill would not be revived, but she stopped short of offering further concessions to protesters, who rejected the gesture and set the stage for more demonstrations.
Mrs. Lam, who said the bill was ''dead,'' pledged to lead a government that would do a better job of listening to the public. But her refusal to give in to the protesters' latest demands showed she was betting on being able to ride out the demonstrations that have thrown the city into a political crisis, lawmakers and observers in Hong Kong said. 
  Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in recent weeks, including in a march on Sunday, to oppose the bill, which would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Tensions erupted last week when a relatively small group of protesters stormed and vandalized the city's legislature.
  Mrs. Lam said she was aware that despite her earlier suspension of the bill, protesters were concerned that the government would revive it later. ''There is no such plan,'' she told reporters. ''The bill is dead.''
  Mrs. Lam's latest remarks did not satisfy the protesters, who have zeroed in on her unwillingness to formally withdraw the bill as evidence that she still underestimates the level of public distrust her administration faces.
  ''Saying the bill is dead is not as good as withdrawing the bill completely,'' said Figo Chan, one of the leaders of Civil Human Rights Front, a coalition of pro-democracy activists that organized several recent marches. (Mrs. Lam argued that there was ''no difference'' between the two concepts.)
  ''We urge the chief executive not to use words to deceive the people of Hong Kong any longer,'' Mr. Chan said.
  Mrs. Lam admitted that the government's handling of the bill had been a ''complete failure'' and pledged to improve the government's engagement with youth, who have been a major force in the protests. But she rejected calls to set up an independent inquiry into the police's use of violence against protesters during clashes on June 12, as well as other demands.
  Calls for the government to set up an independent commission for such a purpose intensified on Tuesday after Andrew Li, a former chief justice of Hong Kong, wrote an op-ed in support of the idea.
  But Mrs. Lam unexpectedly acknowledged that broader, fundamental issues lay beneath the demonstrations, issues that emerged during a failed protest movement in 2014 that sought fully democratic elections for the city's leader.
  The protesters' forceful occupation of the legislature on July 1 was a stark rebuke of Mrs. Lam's administration, and of what many protesters consider the political system's failure to prioritize Hong Kong's interests over those of the Chinese government. In recent days, the protesters have expanded their demands to include the right to directly elect the city's leadership, as well as other political reforms.
  While Mrs. Lam pointed mainly to economic issues in her remarks on Tuesday, Ronny Tong, a lawyer and a member of the territory's Executive Council, or cabinet, said in an interview that he believed ''she does understand that one of the core areas of divide within the community is about political reform.''
  Concerns have grown in Hong Kong about Beijing's interference in the territory's political system, which has resulted in a number of major setbacks for the pro-democracy camp. Six elected lawmakers were removed from office and several others were disqualified from running in local elections.
  Joshua Wong, a key figure from the 2014 movement, and Eddie Chu, a pro-democracy lawmaker, staged a small demonstration on Tuesday to raise concerns about the possible disqualification of pro-democracy candidates in district elections set for November.
  While Mrs. Lam's comments were her strongest attempt yet to reassure the public that the government had learned its lesson from the bungling of the extradition bill, experts said the effort was unlikely to quell widespread anger. For some, the argument over the formal status of the bill has become a proxy for a larger debate over Beijing's influence within Hong Kong's political system.
  ''The protesters are adamant on full withdrawal because, according to them, she cannot say the word because she is a stooge of Beijing,'' said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Center for China Studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ''They want to humiliate her.''
  Beijing has struck a hard line against the protesters who stormed the legislature, calling them ''extreme radicals'' and urging the Hong Kong authorities to restore public order and prosecute those responsible for the tumult.
  The movement has become an occasional irritant for China on the global stage. On Monday, Denise Ho, a pop star and prominent democracy activist in Hong Kong who has supported the protests, urged the United Nations' Human Rights Council to expel China from the body. A Chinese diplomat twice interrupted Ms. Ho's two-minute speech in Geneva, denouncing her comments as slander and violations of Chinese sovereignty.
  The Chinese Foreign Ministry's office in Hong Kong on Tuesday also criticized Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for meeting in Washington with Jimmy Lai, the publisher of Hong Kong's Apple Daily, a pro-democracy newspaper. It said Beijing would not tolerate any collusion between forces inside and outside China to destabilize the Chinese territory.
  ''It is evidently out of ulterior motives that U.S. senior officials have lined up to meet someone like Lai when the situation in Hong Kong remains delicate,'' the office said in a statement.
  Demonstrations are likely to continue, and turnout may even surge over Mrs. Lam's refusal to withdraw the bill. Organizers said several protests were planned for coming weekends, including one in the Sha Tin district in Hong Kong's New Territories region on Sunday.
  But Mrs. Lam and her advisers appeared confident that the protesters' momentum would taper off over time.
  Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker and a member of the cabinet, praised Mrs. Lam on Tuesday, saying she was glad that the leader was ''slowly recovering and coming out of her bunker and responding to public grievances.''
  Ms. Ip predicted that pro-democracy politicians would continue supporting the demonstrations as late as the election period in November.
  ''I think Hong Kong will remain unsettled for a while,'' Ms. Ip said in an interview. ''The polls will provide some kind of safety valve to vent their dissatisfaction.''
  Still, Mrs. Lam was likely to face growing pressure -- both from Beijing, pressing her to assert the government's authority over the territory, and from pro-democracy lawmakers and protesters calling for her to step down. The police have made a number of arrests since protests started about a month ago, and they have vowed to bring those who stormed the legislature to justice swiftly. No senior officials have yet had to step down over the crisis.
  But there is no doubt that Mrs. Lam's administration will face more serious repercussions at a later stage, Michael Tien, a pro-establishment lawmaker, said in an interview.
  ''I am very sure that before her term is up three years from now, some heads will roll,'' he said.

The New York Times ,2019-11-15,Inside Hong Kong _s Battle-Ready Campuses,849 ,"
Classrooms may be empty, but universities are bustling with preparation for confrontations with the police. 
HONG KONG — Across Hong Kong’s university campuses, students and their supporters are bracing for police confrontations in increasingly elaborate ways: constructing Molotov cocktail assembly lines, erecting catapults that use helmets to launch projectiles, and building walls made of brick and mortar or crosshatched bamboo. 
As riot police officers bombarded the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Tuesday with rapid-fire tear gas and stinging liquid, a secluded haven for learning suddenly looked more like a battlefield. Now, students across the city said, they are being pushed to defend themselves in more radical ways.
“They are insulting the institution of universities. This is a holy place for us to learn. It’s not a place for them to ruin,” said Anna Foy, a 23-year-old graduate student. “I used to just Photoshop posters, protesting in air-conditioning. But now I have evolved into someone who goes to the front line.” 
After five months of unrest, tensions rose in the past week, first after the death of a student demonstrator who fell from a parking garage, and then after the police shooting of an unarmed protester. Demonstrators have disrupted the city’s transportation system in recent days in an effort to force the government to respond to their demands, including accountability for the police. 
As the police crack down, students have found themselves in previously unimaginable situations.
“I didn’t think I would be mixing these chemicals with my own hands, but I am here to learn,” said Jacqueline Kwok, a 19-year-old student at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, or PolyU, surrounded by plastic funnels, rolled towels and glass bottles. The pungent smell of chemicals filled the air as another protester tested a freshly made gasoline bomb by hurling it into a drained swimming pool, flames licking the blue tiles as the bottle smashed.
Other students said they planned to make smoke bombs that would cause less bodily harm, but whose sulfuric odors would also deter police advances.
On the edges of campuses, black-clad protesters stalked rooftops and makeshift watchtowers, keeping a wary eye out for undercover officers and potential snitches. Visitors who wanted to pass through had to show either student or press cards at “customs” stands, and present their belongings to be inspected.
Protesters scattered nails and bricks stacked like mini Stonehenges, to slow down police vehicles should they try to clear the roads. And small groups roamed with bows and arrows, a few even practicing with flames.
Ken Chan, a 17-year-old high school student and archery hobbyist, said: “I know this is really extreme and risky. I would consider shooting arrows as a final resort, if I could protect the people of Polytechnic University and to protect Hong Kongers. This is really extreme.” 
University leaders said they were alarmed that violent clashes — and preparations for future ones — had reached campus grounds previously untouched during the months of unrest, and that large numbers of outside protesters were now occupying its buildings and fields. 
“Our campus has been turned into a scene of disorder,” PolyU said in a statement, urging students and staff members to stay away and pleading for the outside protesters to leave. Classes were being held online.
At the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Friday night, protesters evacuated the campus after a van was set on fire and explosions were heard.
John Tse, police chief superintendent, said on Wednesday that the force suspected that C.U.H.K. was being used as a “weapon factory.” He added that the use of tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds against students was justified on those grounds.
Fearing a new incursion by the police, many supporters of the protesters, including alumni, flocked to the campuses, leaving bags of food and supplies. “We are very worried about the students, so we wanted to come back and check on them,” said Karen Chan, a 30-year-old social worker and graduate of PolyU.
The campus’s cafeteria had the air of a disaster bazaar, with overflowing boxes of bottled water, gas masks, goggles and paper towels, organized by category. In the kitchens, volunteer cooks made simple meals of white rice, canned meat and noodles.
“When it was quiet, I started making chicken-egg sandwiches for protesters so that they can eat something yummy, not just ramen, ramen and ramen,” said Ryan Fa, a 17-year-old volunteer medic.
Elite universities like C.U.H.K. and the University of Hong Kong have even earned nicknames like Riot U and Revolution University. 
Coco Wong, a C.U.H.K. student, said the name Riot U reflected the “wild” nature of her classmates.
 “InRiot U, we have people with all sorts of knowledge and ability,” she said. “When our home turf is being invaded, we can only rush to the front and fight back.”

The New York Times,2019-11-17,Hong Kong Protests_ How Does This End_,714 ,"
A bill before Congress would put the United States squarely on the side of the protesters, even as the demonstrations seem to spin out of control.
After nearly six months of escalating protests, Hong Kong is a mess, its reputation for efficiency in tatters, its economy in recession, its roads and rails often blocked. And there is no end in sight.  
  That poses a quandary for those who admire and support the protest movement, but who recoil at the notion of such a unique and vibrant enclave self-destructing. The difficulty is compounded by the fact that the movement has no leadership, no coordinating committee to advise, to cheer or to warn.
  In the end, however, there is no choice for those who cherish freedom but to support the protests, as a bill pending in the United States Congress does. The protests may be counterproductive, destructive, leaderless and even futile, but for these same reasons they are an altruistic, self-sacrificing and genuine demonstration that people who have known freedom, even in a limited form, refuse to surrender it.
  It is doubtful that Xi Jinping, the authoritarian Chinese leader, understands the resistance or the longing. Those who rise to the pinnacle of a secretive, authoritarian, coercive system like China's are molded to believe that you can control all the people all the time, if you can only find the right combination of sticks, carrots, lies and information filters. To them, any dissent must be a political plot hatched in dark foreign corners.
  What Mr. Xi does instinctively understand is the threat posed by Hong Kong while he is waging a global propaganda offensive, backed by the lure of China's enormous market. A Tiananmen-style crackdown, he knows, would be disastrous for China's standing and image. But letting the protesters have their way, he believes, would show weakness and potentially encourage repressed minorities in China, such as the Uighurs, Kazakhs or Tibetans, to push for their rights.
  Lacking any means for winning the Hong Kongers' hearts or minds and unable to give in to their demands, leaders in Beijing and their loyalists in Hong Kong, including the administration led by Carrie Lam, see no alternative to exerting ever greater police force. And that serves only to further inflame the demonstrators.
  Foreign governments, too, confront a dilemma. On the commercial side, overt support for the protests could lead to a loss of Chinese business. President Trump, for one, has stayed largely silent on the latest protests, even while grappling with Mr. Xi on trade, evidently seeking not to trammel the chance of a deal. There is also the problem of supporting demonstrations in which protesters have sometimes resorted to violence, even if police violence has been far greater and more systematic. Nothing justifies setting an opponent on fire, as one protester apparently did.
  These incidents of violence must be noted and condemned. But they are inevitable in confrontations with police that have been escalating over many weeks. One thing remains incontestable: In this protracted and painful confrontation, the people of Hong Kong hold the moral high ground in their determination to decide their own fate and to reject the animal farm that China would put them in even before the transition to full Chinese control in 2047, the date established in the agreement that ended Britain's control over its former colony.
  There is no way to predict how long the protests will continue, or what will be their outcome. But the people of Hong Kong deserve support, and Mr. Xi should be left with no doubt that violent intervention will carry an immediate and heavy price.
  The bill before Congress, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which accuses the Chinese government of creating more chaos and warns of new sanctions, has the support of both parties, and should be brought to a vote without further delay. Painful as it is to observe, this is a struggle that the free world must support.

The New York Times ,2019-07-15,"Hong Kong _s Leader, Faced With More Clashes, Condemns Violence",1036 ,"
HONG KONG — Hong Kong’s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, on Monday condemned violent clashes between a number of protesters and the police over the weekend, as her government scrambled to assert its authority after several increasingly volatile demonstrations and a surge in anti-police sentiment.
“We are here to thank our police officers for safeguarding Hong Kong’s safety at the front lines,” Mrs. Lam told reporters at a hospital where she was visiting several police officers who were injured in the clashes on Sunday. “They fulfilled their duties responsibly and were very professional and restrained, but they were intentionally attacked by people who I really think we can describe as rioters.”
On Sunday, tens of thousands of people attended a peaceful rally urging Mrs. Lam to fully withdraw a contentious bill and resign. By the evening, however, the demonstration had  between a small group of protesters and police officers in riot gear in a luxury shopping mall in Sha Tin, in the New Territories region of northern Hong Kong.
The clashes were the latest in a pattern that has emerged in Hong Kong in recent weeks in which mass rallies have ended in violent confrontations between a small group of mostly younger demonstrators armed with umbrellas and helmets and police officers wielding batons, pepper spray and shields.
Pro-democracy lawmakers and activists say the protesters’ increasing willingness to adopt more forceful means  with a political system they see as having left them powerless by denying them the right to directly elect the city’s leadership.
Mrs. Lam  last week but stopped short of fully withdrawing it, a stance that continued to drive a large turnout at rallies this past weekend. The Hong Kong leader may be in a bind: She is under pressure from Beijing to             over the semiautonomous region, but her refusal to give in to the protesters’ demands seems at least in part to drive each escalation of violence.
The mass demonstrations started in early June in response to unpopular legislation that would allow extraditions to mainland China. Protesters have since expanded their demands to include universal suffrage, amnesty for protesters arrested at earlier clashes and an independent inquiry into police violence. They have also turned their anger at mainland Chinese who visit Hong Kong to shop or to buy medicine, powdered baby formula and other goods for resale across the border.
In a dramatic escalation of tensions, some protesters  on July 1, the anniversary of Britain’s 1997 return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule. That was followed by confrontations in the district of Mong Kok and on Saturday, a             that also descended into conflict.
On Sunday, protesters were seen throwing umbrellas and plastic bottles at officers in riot gear while the police deployed pepper spray and struck at demonstrators with batons and shields. In surreal scenes that played on a loop on local television stations on Monday, several young, mostly masked protesters beat up a police officer who was lying on the ground.
Several pro-democracy lawmakers criticized the police’s handling of the demonstration in Sha Tin, saying that the use of full riot gear was disproportionate to the threat posed by the protesters and their umbrellas and improvised shields.
But Stephen Lo, the Hong Kong police commissioner, defended his officers’ actions at the mall in Sha Tin.
“When there were people breaking the law, should the police really just allow them to do so?” he said early Monday morning, referring to the protesters in the mall as “rioters.”
“The police were working very hard, but their diligence has only been greeted with accusations,” he added, while vowing to investigate Sunday night’s unrest with “full force.”
Mr. Lo said that as of Monday morning, at least 40 people had been arrested and that about 10 police officers were injured. Twenty-eight people were admitted to the hospital for injuries and by Monday afternoon, two remained in critical condition, the Hong Kong Hospital Authority said.
Mrs. Lam’s latest remarks labeling the Sha Tin protesters as “rioters” will almost certainly fuel further anger among demonstrators, who were already planning more marches, including one on Sunday in the city’s financial district. That label has been at the center of one of the demands of the protesters, who argue that people who participated in a  were not rioters.
While many of the protesters’ frustrations have centered on Mrs. Lam, the focus in recent weeks has shifted to the police, who  after officers fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse protesters. Since then, the police have mostly tried to project restraint but have appeared unable to prevent the protests from spinning out of control.
“Normal people who attend marches don’t use violent means to attack the police like this,” said John Lee, Hong Kong’s security minister, as he spoke alongside Mrs. Lam on Monday. “We can see that those who deliberately and violently attack the police are highly organized.”
Mrs. Lam also reiterated that she intended to serve until her term as chief executive ends in 2022. She indicated that she would not make further concessions on the extradition bill despite the protests.
“What prompted the resistance no longer exists,” she said, referring to the suspension of the legislation.
“I know our responses may not fully satisfy those who are voicing these demands, but this is not my personal problem.”

BEIJING — China’s authoritarian president used the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule on Tuesday to pledge that nothing would stop his nation’s ascent. But the message was marred by some of the worst anti-government violence to convulse , including the first police            .
Anticipation of a confrontation in Hong Kong on the anniversary, which Chinese leaders in Beijing consider a sacrosanct event, had been building since the protests began this summer in the semiautonomous territory bordering southern China. It intensified in recent weeks as a combative core of protesters confronted police officers who have relied more heavily on force.
The split-screen contrast of tightly choreographed in Beijing to celebrate the National Day versus            in Hong Kong was jarring, and almost certainly infuriating to President Xi Jinping.
It laid bare how Mr. Xi’s image and agenda have become hostage to the months of , undermining his reputation for unshakable control.
As the festivities in Beijing got underway, Mr. Xi offered his government as a guarantor of “prosperity and stability” in Hong Kong. But after the parade ended, protesters in Hong Kong directly challenged China’s hold over the city, clashing with the police in multiple neighborhoods that turned vast swathes of the territory into a tear gas-choked and bonfire-filled battlefield.
“I think they’ve succeeded in spoiling the show,” said , a professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University who specializes in Chinese politics. “The media will be split between covering the parade in Beijing and covering what’s happening in Hong Kong.”
For Mr. Xi, every element of the military parade and civilian march marking 70 years since Mao founded the People’s Republic was designed and meticulously rehearsed to show that his authoritarian policies were transforming China into a wealthy, militarily formidable and socially united superpower.
He presided over an 80-minute parade by China’s military that included the first public showing of a missile that can carry 10 nuclear warheads and hit anywhere in the United States. A civilian march displayed the country’s economic and technological accomplishments, including its homegrown C919 jetliner,  and a            .
“No force can shake the status of our great motherland,” Mr. Xi said, overlooking Tiananmen Square. “No force can obstruct the advance of the Chinese people and Chinese nation.”
While this year’s parade, as previous ones, was intended to strut the country’s military might, it also reflected a modernization program that Mr. Xi has pushed through the People’s Liberation Army.
Several new weapons made their first public appearances, including supersonic and stealth drones and an unmanned underwater vehicle. So did the country’s newest intercontinental ballistic missile, called the DF-41, that can deliver multiple nuclear warheads around the world.
“I’ve heard what President Xi has said about focusing on peace but I am also sure that China will not display weakness,” Gao Yuan, 23, a worker in Beijing’s high-tech district, said after watching the parade, one of an estimated 120 million who did so, according to state media. “We are very powerful — just look at our tanks and planes and you can see how very strong our country is.”
All the displays of China’s economic and military strength, however, seems unable to silence those in Hong Kong who oppose Mr. Xi’s increasingly intolerant ideological rule over China.
In his speech marking the national anniversary, Mr. Xi promised to keep Hong Kong under the “one country, two systems” framework, designed to give it considerable legal and political autonomy after the British left in 1997. But to increase Chinese leverage over the city.
The protests that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the party controls the courts. They quickly evolved into calls for police accountability and broader democratic reforms by protesters, who felt the Hong Kong political establishment had been overly beholden to Beijing and allowed it to erode their freedoms.
In Hong Kong, the protesters seized on China’s long-planned 70th anniversary celebrations as a moment to humble Mr. Xi. Tens of thousands marched through a busy shopping district in the afternoon despite a police ban. Chants of a popular protest slogan, “Reclaim Hong Kong; revolution of our times,” echoed off a canyon of skyscrapers and shuttered malls.
“I couldn’t just sit home today,” said Stanley Luk, 65, who owns a handbag factory on the mainland but joined the protest march. “There’s not much we can do. But at least we can tell Beijing no, we don’t want to live the way they do.”
Clashes quickly broke out in other areas where hundreds of black-clad protesters fought with riot police officers, lobbing firebombs, setting piles of trash on fire and attacking the premises of private businesses they deemed as sympathetic to Beijing.
When the protesters refused to retreat, the police fired bullets, mostly into the air.
But in the Tsuen Wan neighborhood, near Hong Kong’s border with the Chinese mainland, a police officer shot an 18-year-old in the left shoulder during a melee.
Video footage showed that before the shooting, a protester had been among a large group of people who tackled a police officer to the ground and beat him with what looked like metal pipes. That protester then turned to a second police officer, who was backed against a shuttered storefront with his gun drawn. The officer fired at close range, after the protester appeared to have hit him.
The shooting was likely to further inflame tensions in the territory. The protesters  by what they see as police brutality over the summer, while supporters of the police have             the tolerance limits of the force.
Natalie Chan, a university student who was protesting on Tuesday night in the Tuen Mun district, not far from Tsuen Wan, said that the Hong Kong police were “hurting innocent people.”
“We can’t let them continue,” Ms. Chan said of the police, as nearby protesters smashed traffic lights and the windows of shops and restaurants.
Mr. Xi has never mentioned the tumult in the territory. And for months, he seemed to have decided to leave it to the Hong Kong authorities to handle.
The question now, with the holiday having passed, is whether Mr. Xi’s calculus will change. China is already facing myriad challenges — from the trade war with the United States to economic pressures that are  to the lowest level in years — that could make the authorities in Beijing lose patience with the defiance in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong’s embattled chief executive, , attended the parade, seated on the rostrum of the Tiananmen Gate with Mr. Xi, and former leaders, the members of the Communist Party’s Standing Committee and other provincial leaders. Her critics in Hong Kong derided her smiling presence in Beijing as that of a supplicant, not an autonomous leader, which illustrated the depth of the chasm between the two sides.
As evening fell and Beijing prepared for celebratory fireworks, Hong Kong had descended into some of the most intense clashes seen since the protests began almost four months ago.
The protests paralyzed large areas of the territory as major thoroughfares were blocked in tense standoffs between demonstrators and the police. Subway stations, libraries, shopping malls and storefronts were shut in nine districts where the protests erupted.
Sirens of ambulances and fire trucks wailed as the police chased and accosted the protesters. Some demonstrators burned Chinese flags and photographs of Mr. Xi. The police said some protesters attacked officers with a “corrosive fluid,” causing chemical burns, and threw gasoline bombs into a train compartment and onto a subway station platform.
In the end, more than 180 people were arrested, 25 officers were injured and 74 people were hospitalized including two in critical condition, the authorities said.
The Hong Kong police commissioner, Stephen Lo, told reporters at a midnight news conference that doctors were treating the 18-year-old who had been shot. Mr. Lo said the authorities would decide later whether to press charges against him for assaulting a police officer.
Mr. Lo also said the police officer who fired had acted in a “legal and reasonable” manner by giving a verbal warning beforehand, and that the officer had been forced to shoot after being assaulted at close quarters.
“The range was not determined by the police officer, but by the perpetrator,” he said.
But some Hong Kongers felt that the authorities were to blame for allowing the day to spiral into chaos.
In Wong Tai Sin, where the police fired tear gas near a retirement home, dozens of residents without masks or protest gear shouted at officers to retreat. Some mocked the city’s leader, Mrs. Lam, for having left town.
“I want to cry. I come downstairs and feel that I have walked into a war zone,” said Vincey Wu, a 53-year-old accountant. “Carrie Lam has gone off to celebrate National Day. But has she thought about her people who are breathing in tear gas?”

The New York Times,2019-07-20,"Hong Kong 's Leaders, Bracing for New Protests, Say No to More Concessions",996 ,"
HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's leader will not be making further concessions to the city's protesters, two of her top advisers said, as the government digs in despite several large demonstrations over the past month and more planned for Sunday and the coming weeks.
Carrie Lam, the region's chief executive, will focus instead on hearing from various sectors of the Hong Kong population and drafting a broad policy address for delivery in mid-October, said Bernard Chan, the convenor of her Executive Council, or cabinet, in an interview on Friday. 
  Mr. Chan's remarks -- and similar comments by Regina Ip, another Executive Council member, in a separate interview -- indicate that Mrs. Lam's administration is confident that it can weather further protests, despite several recent violent clashes and signs that the economy could suffer.
  Waiting and hoping that protests fade away worked for the government during the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement in 2014, in which demonstrators occupied sections of major roads for months. But Mrs. Lam's refusal to meet the current protesters' demands, including a call for her resignation, runs the risk of driving large turnouts at rallies and more violent confrontations.
  In her October address, Mrs. Lam plans to emphasize that the government will improve its consultation with the public before rolling out new draft laws or policies, Mr. Chan said by phone from Australia, where he was on a trip to promote investment in Hong Kong and neighboring cities. The large protests that started in early June were driven by Mrs. Lam's hasty introduction of a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China.
  The bill angered a broad swath of the Hong Kong public, who worried that it would potentially expose anyone in the city to trials in the mainland's opaque judicial system.
  Even though Mrs. Lam has apologized for introducing the bill and declared it ''dead,'' protests have continued to draw large crowds. Demonstrators have demanded, among other things, the formal withdrawal of the legislation, Mrs. Lam's resignation and an independent inquiry into the police's actions against demonstrators.
  Mr. Chan said that by suspending the bill, the government had already done everything it could be expected to do in response to the protesters. He suggested that they were effectively seeking independence for the semiautonomous Chinese region.
  ''I don't think they would stop even if you met their demands,'' he said. ''They just don't want Hong Kong to be part of China, which is impossible.''
  He added that Mrs. Lam would not resign and said he had not heard her express any desire to do so, even in private.
  Mrs. Lam is also unlikely to reopen the longstanding issue of introducing universal suffrage, Mr. Chan said. In recent weeks, the protesters have increasingly called for direct elections, drawing into focus the deep-seated anxiety among many in Hong Kong over the recent erosion of freedoms promised in 1997 when Britain returned the city to Chinese control, under the authoritarian Communist Party.
  Mr. Chan said universal suffrage would only be up for negotiation if democracy advocates first accepted a proposal made by Beijing five years ago. It would have allowed general elections for the city's top job, but a committee dominated by Beijing loyalists would have decided which candidates would be allowed on the ballot.
  The Umbrella Movement protesters rejected that offer as inadequate, and the proposal did not become Hong Kong law. Without a clear agreement in advance from democracy advocates to accept the proposal, Mr. Chan said, ''it is not that helpful to reopen that dialogue.''
  Some politicians think the pro-democracy movement plans to try to keep up the momentum of their rallies until November, when elections will be held to choose members of the region's district councils.
  ''Because of the district council elections in November, the government is sitting tight, trying not to anger voters,'' said Mrs. Ip, who is also a pro-Beijing member of the legislature.
  But the government's strategy of delay carries risks, for both the government and the protesters.
  Further protests could hurt the local economy. The parent companies of brands like Swatch, Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels have reported in recent days that their financial results were hurt in the second quarter by faltering sales in Hong Kong, a big retailing and finance hub for East Asia and particularly China.
  Financial leaders say that some wealthy families from mainland China and Hong Kong itself have been transferring sizable chunks of their holdings from bank accounts in Hong Kong to accounts elsewhere, particularly in Singapore.
  Mr. Chan, who is also the president of a Hong Kong insurance company, said that Hong Kong's role as a financial hub has not been affected. Some people who made their money through corrupt activities on the mainland may now be moving it farther away to evade mainland law enforcement, but there had been early signs of that trend even before the current dispute, he said.
  More protests could also result in injuries or deaths among demonstrators or police. Violence by protesters, including the beating of a police officer last weekend that was recorded on video and widely replayed online, could gradually undermine public support.
  Many pro-democracy advocates, however, have said the movement has remained united even when some protesters have taken a more confrontational approach.
  Protest organizers say that they believe that they have the stamina and public support to last in a prolonged dispute. Bonnie Leung, a vice convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, which is one of the main groups backing the protests, said that the police had used excessive force against demonstrators and were therefore responsible for violence by protesters.
  ''We cannot control the protests, we do not want to,'' she said. ''If the police behave themselves, protesters will be peaceful.''"

The New York Times ,2019-08-12,Over 150 Flights Canceled as Hong Kong Airport Is Flooded by Protesters,1334 ,"
HONG KONG — Thousands of anti-government demonstrators flooded Hong Kong’s airport on Monday, in a stark display of the power of the protests to bring one of the world’s busiest transportation hubs to a near halt.
But the escalating tensions have also prompted a more ominous tone from the Chinese leadership. The central government on Monday condemned the protesters’ previous actions, including the use of a gasoline bomb, saying they had “begun to show signs of terrorism.”
Over the weekend, several armored personnel carriers and trucks were also seen in Shenzhen, a mainland city near Hong Kong, according to a , a nationalist mainland tabloid. The vehicles were from the People’s Armed Police, which handles civil disturbances. The newspaper said they were assembling “in advance of apparent large-scale exercises.”
This summer’s protests in Hong Kong began in early June in opposition to legislation that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the Communist Party. That proposal has since been suspended but not fully withdrawn, and it continues to drive antigovernment sentiment. Other issues have loomed larger in recent weeks, including the stalled promise of more direct elections and the use of force by the police against demonstrators.
[Here’s a  and how they evolved.]
Members of the largely leaderless movement had called for the demonstration at the airport after a night of clashes on Sunday, during which the police  in another. Many airport protesters on Monday were angry that a woman at one of the Sunday demonstrations had been hit in her eye by a projectile.
“Yesterday’s escalation of violence and repression on the part of police, I think it’s a consequence of the very clear stance from Beijing that they are unconditionally behind the police and are relying on them to quell the protests in Hong Kong,” said Samson Yuen, an assistant professor of political science at Lingnan University in Hong Kong who studies local social movements.
As the clashes intensify, Chinese and Hong Kong officials are escalating their criticism of the protesters.
“Hong Kong’s radical demonstrators have repeatedly attacked police officers with extremely dangerous means,” said Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, which oversees Chinese policy toward the two cities. “These have already constituted serious violent crimes and have begun to show signs of terrorism.”
Steve Li Kwai-wah, a senior police superintendent in Hong Kong, disputed that characterization. “We are not at that stage yet,” he said, citing the United Nations definition of terrorism as a guide.
Protesters gathered at the airport throughout the afternoon on Monday, eventually filling the arrival hall in the main terminal, before more protesters went upstairs to the departure hall.
The airport said in a statement that operations had been “seriously disrupted as a result of the public assembly at the airport today.” A Hong Kong official called it an “illegal assembly.”
The cancellations — which continued into Tuesday morning — affected thousands of passengers at Hong Kong International Airport, which  last year. The airport said on Monday afternoon that all flights had been canceled for the rest of the day, other than those already en route to Hong Kong. Almost 150 departures and more than two dozen arrivals were affected, according to the airport’s website.
Some people said they agreed with the protesters’ pro-democracy agenda.
“If they have to stand for something, as long as it’s peaceful, I can understand that,” said Africa Alvarez, 48, who was flying home to Barcelona. “I can’t take my flight against something which is more important.”
Others expressed frustration.
“I am sympathetic for people who want changes, but I’m not sure it’s the best way to go about it,” said Pauline Price, 52, a movie theater manager from New Zealand.
She said protesters risked losing support if their “ad hoc” moves became too disruptive: “Hong Kong was stable. It was one of the safest places in the world. This damages the image of Hong Kong.”
As passengers and protesters streamed out of the airport, they formed long lines for taxis and the Airport Express train. Many protesters walked to the nearby town of Tung Chung to take the subway.
Antigovernment protesters had staged a  at the airport over the weekend, during which they handed out pamphlets to travelers explaining their grievances. That protest, which started on Friday, did not noticeably disrupt services.

 and prominent businesses have joined China’s central government in condemning violent protests. But the aggressive approach by the police could increase public support for the movement, as images of bloodied protesters circulate on social media and in local news outlets.
Five years ago, the use of tear gas by the police against student activists helped set off a protest movement that occupied roadways for nearly three months. In June, aggressive use of tear gas and pepper spray was followed by the biggest march in Hong Kong this summer, with as many as two million people participating, according to the organizers.
Hong Kong residents were especially appalled by confrontations on Sunday between protesters and police officers that took place inside subway stations, part of the city’s famously reliable public transit system.
At the Kwai Fong station, in the New Territories region of Hong Kong that borders mainland China, officers pursuing protesters who had gathered at a nearby police station , in what was apparently their first use of tear gas in an enclosed area. The police also             in the Tai Koo station on Hong Kong Island, swinging batons and             from a short distance.
In the Causeway Bay neighborhood on Hong Kong Island, police officers and men disguised as protesters grabbed a man and pinned his bleeding head to the ground as he moaned and said that his tooth was broken, , an online news outlet.
In Tsim Sha Tsui, a popular shopping district on the Kowloon peninsula across the harbor from Hong Kong Island, a woman needed emergency surgery after being hit in her right eye, apparently by a projectile, according to local news reports. Her status was not immediately known.
Terence Mak, an assistant police commissioner, said it was unclear how the woman had been injured.
“We don’t have enough information right now,” he said. “There were many weapons on scene, such as bean bag rounds as well as steel balls,” a reference to slingshots that he said were used by protesters.
The injury to the woman in particular angered protesters at the airport, many of whom covered their right eyes with bandages in an expression of solidarity.
Noel Tse, a 29-year-old nurse, said she had joined the airport protest because she thought the police had acted with excessive force against demonstrators on Sunday night.

The Communist Party has spent decades preparing the people to defend a united homeland. Hong Kong’s protests show it has paid off.
 have disrupted Yang Yang’s family life. Though the 29-year-old lives in mainland China, he was inspired by the demonstrations to write a song about freedom and upload it to the internet. When censors deleted it, he complained to his family.
They weren’t sympathetic. “How can you support Hong Kong separatists?” they asked. “How can you be anti-China?” His mother threatened to disown him. Before Mr. Yang left on a trip to Japan in August, his father said he hoped his son would die there.
Hong Kong’s protests have inflamed tensions in the semiautonomous Chinese city, but passions in the mainland have been just as heated — and, seemingly, almost exclusively against the demonstrators. 
A pro-protest tweet by a Houston Rockets executive, Daryl Morey, ignited , demonstrating the depth of feeling.            , the only N.B.A. owner of Chinese descent, said all of China — yes, more than one billion people — felt the same way. 
“The one thing that is terribly misunderstood, and often ignored, by the western press and those critical of China is that 1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country’s sovereignty over her homeland,” . “This issue is non-negotiable.”
For Westerners, this is strange language. You don’t hear about the common feelings of 300 million Americans or 60 million Brits, especially in the era of Donald Trump and Brexit. 
Yet, in China, there is some truth to it. Of course, it’s a vast country brimming with opinions. But the Communist Party has spent decades preparing the Chinese people for a moment like this. The stir over Hong Kong shows, in dramatic fashion, how successful it has been, and how the world could be shaped by it.
“As soon as the Communist Party pushes the patriotism button, Chinese will rise up like zombies to unite against the foreign forces, be it Japan or N.B.A.,” said Mr. Yang, the singer-songwriter. “They don’t always know why they’re against those things. In fact, many Chinese like Japan and the N.B.A.”
Until Thursday, when China’s internet minders , the Chinese online world was filled with denunciations of the protests. Some Chinese people have even scaled the Great Firewall, China’s highly effective online censorship system, to post anti-protest messages on services like Facebook and Instagram that their own government doesn’t want them to see. 
Their comments reflect a narrative that China’s top-down education system delivers from a young age. A united China, a country with a common purpose, can stand strong against outsiders, according to this narrative. A divided China could slip backward, losing decades of progress and plunging the country back into chaos.
Any Chinese person who has gone to elementary school or watched television news can explain the tale of China&#39;s 100 years of humiliation. Starting with the Opium Wars in the 19th century, foreign powers bullied a weak and backward China into turning Hong Kong and Macau into European colonies. Students must memorize the unequal treaties the Qing dynasty signed during that period. 
There’s even a name for it: “national humiliation education.” 
This narrative glosses over a lot of history, including the cruelty of Mao’s revolution, the starving of millions during Mao’s Great Leap Forward and the madness of his decade-long Cultural Revolution. When it does include the 1989 crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square, the protest and its aftermath is mentioned in one sentence and portrayed vaguely as a political incident. 
These lessons and propaganda sound crude, but they work. For years, I regarded Chris Patten, the last Hong Kong governor under the British rule, as “a sinner condemned by history.” That’s what state media called him, especially after he approved spending heavily to build Hong Kong’s new airport, leading to accusations of waste. Today, I regularly use that airport, , as do millions of others. 
Of course, my friends and I watched with great pride Hong Kong’s handover ceremony from Britain to China in 1997. Territorial integrity achieved!
At the graduate school of journalism at Columbia University in 2002, one American student told me about his trip to Tibet. I was so incensed by his remarks that I blurted out, “Tibet is part of China!” 
For Westerners, perhaps one way to understand would be to read “,” a memoir by Tara Westover about escaping her survivalist Mormon family in the mountains of Idaho. It has nothing to do with China. But her struggle to unlearn what her parents taught her felt familiar to me after I left China and began to learn its history on my own. 
The rise of the internet and China’s opening were supposed to widen views there. Instead, the party is narrowing them more. Education officials over the past two years have been increasingly enforcing a widely ignored 2004 effort to make education even more Chinese focused.
In some middle school history books, the Cultural Revolution is described as “a detour in the Communist Party’s expedition,” rather than as a mistake. Some universities have replaced textbooks by Western academics such as  and             with books written under a program called “Marxist theory research and building project.” 
Textbook publishers have cut back on essays by  known for his acerbic criticism of the nationalist government in the 1920s and 1930s. They were once a mainstay of school texts, but some Chinese people have used his articles to criticize current events. One, about how Chinese people should welcome criticism from foreigners, was posted on the social media platform Weibo this past week after the N.B.A. debacle, then was pulled down. 
Already, China has become more effective at . Slogans that I learned without much conviction more than 30 years ago — like “Without the Communist Party, there would be no China” — are making a comeback. 
These lessons might seem removed from the situation in Hong Kong, where the protesters are mainly Chinese, not foreigners. But state media has , sometimes identifying Western bystanders and journalists — including             — as American instigators. 
State media also portrays the protests as a push for Hong Kong independence from China, a direct effort to tap into those feelings of territorial integrity. That thought has echoed. Mr. Tsai, the N.B.A. owner, called the protests “a separatist movement.” 
But  support full independence from the mainland. The five core demands of the protesters don’t include it. It’s an important distinction, one that Mr. Tsai’s newspaper — The South China Morning Post, owned by Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant where Mr. Tsai is executive vice chairman —            . 
For China, the big danger is that it will become even more intolerant of criticism and different opinions. 
A Chinese blogger wrote this week that a renovation project at a top Beijing middle school was causing widespread health issues, giving students bloody noses several times a day. The reaction was strong, and strongly against him. Many students told him there was nothing wrong with their school and even if there was, it was none of his business. “He should have shut his mouth just like N.B.A.’s Morey,” wrote one commenter. 
Mr. Yang, the singer-songwriter, said “all hell broke loose” after his family and members of his band learned that he supported the Hong Kong protests. His younger brother told him he was sick in his mind. Former classmates castigated him online. 
“The Hong Kong protests have definitely made them a lot more patriotic,” he said. 
Over the years, he had tried to show people around him the videos of the Tiananmen Square crackdown and other events. His family told him that he should look at the brighter side of the history. The party has since provided education, jobs and pensions, they said.
“I feel as alone as an island,” he said. “I’m surrounded by very familiar strangers.”

The New York Times ,2019-06-19,"With Hymns and Prayers, Christians Help Drive Hong Kong _s Protests",1224 ,"
Christianity has had a striking influence in demonstrations against a proposed law that would allow extraditions to mainland China.
HONG KONG — Armed with a Bible, a guitar and a drawing of Jesus walking on water, Andrea Wong sat outside the offices of Hong Kong’s central government and booed.
Ms. Wong, 18, usually stays out of politics. But in recent weeks, as Hong Kong was swept by mass protests against closer ties with mainland China, she asked herself what a good Christian would do.
“I am very certain that Jesus would not have stayed home enjoying the air-conditioning,” Ms. Wong said. “He would have been out here helping people and marching.”
Christians have been a visible part of the protests this month — among the largest in Hong Kong’s history — providing food and shelter at demonstrations and condemning . Many protesters, even those who are not religious, have embraced the teachings and messages of Christianity to denounce a proposed law to allow extraditions to mainland China.
Protesters have spoken of “loving thy neighbor” and winning a battle of “good versus evil.” Youth groups have held prayer circles to call for peace and redemption for the police. A hymn called “Sing Hallelujah to the Lord” has become an unofficial anthem of the demonstrations, echoing from bridges and makeshift shelters.
Hong Kong’s Christians have long played an important role in the politics of the semiautonomous Chinese territory, on issues like religious freedom, democracy and human rights. And though Catholics and Protestants make up only about one in nine people in this city of 7.5 million, the influence of Christianity in the protests has been striking, providing a source of inspiration and solace.
“We believe in upholding justice,” said David Cheung, a pastor who has taken part in the protests. “Our faith gives us our courage, confidence and hope against this evil government power.”
Christians’ influence is all the more noticeable as Chinese officials have  in the mainland. Last year, Beijing             recognizing the legitimacy of government-appointed bishops, a deal that was criticized by Catholic leaders in Hong Kong.
Many Christians said they saw the extradition measure as opening a door for China’s severe restrictions on religious freedom to make their way into Hong Kong.
“The law is unjust,” said Carita Ng, 52. “It is very dangerous to citizens like us because it deprives us of free speech. As Christians, we need it more than anyone.”
The extradition bill was indefinitely  after large numbers of people had taken to the streets twice in four days. The measure would allow criminal suspects to be transferred for trial in jurisdictions including mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party.
On Sunday, a day after the bill was suspended, protesters turned out in even bigger numbers, with crowds that organizers estimated at close to two million people demanding that the measure be fully withdrawn. 
The demonstrators have focused much of their ire on Hong Kong’s top leader, Carrie Lam, who is a devout Catholic. On Tuesday, Mrs. Lam  and promised to better listen to the concerns of the public. Many protesters, who have called on her to resign, were unsatisfied with her apology.
For Christians, Mrs. Lam’s actions have a religious dimension. Many say they believe she has sinned and should step down. At the same time, they say they pray for her and hope she has a chance at redemption.
“She has gone astray,” said Ms. Wong, who has spent up to 10 hours a day singing, praying and marching during the protests. “I hope she will have the wisdom to do the right thing.”
On Monday, Mrs. Lam met with religious leaders and apologized. She told them she was lucky to be able to turn to her faith in a difficult time, according to the Rev. Canon Peter Douglas Koon, who attended the meeting. Mrs. Lam asked the leaders to pray for her and for Hong Kong, Father Koon said.
Among the first to speak out against the proposed extradition law was Cardinal Joseph Zen, the retired archbishop of Hong Kong.
Beyond worries that the law could be used by mainland officials to punish churches in Hong Kong, Cardinal Zen said Christians were united with other protesters by a fear that the law would leave Hong Kong residents vulnerable to the whims of mainland courts.
“Our clergy is rather conservative; not many usually come out,” he said. “But I think this is a moment when we should stand with the people. Otherwise, we are against the people, and there is no middle way.”
The prominence of Christianity in the protests has lent legitimacy and protection to the protesters, helping them go up against government officials like Mrs. Lam who initially dismissed their demands and compared them to spoiled children.
Some protesters who gathered outside the local legislature were advised to sing hymns because religious assemblies are more difficult for the police to break up.
On Wednesday, Cardinal John Tong of the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong and the Rev. Eric So, chairman of the Hong Kong Christian Council, called on Mrs. Lam to withdraw the extradition bill and begin an independent inquiry into the police response to the protests.
A judicial challenge has also been  alleging that an officer made a discriminatory remark when he told a group of clerics at a protest, “Ask your Jesus to come down and see us.”
Hong Kong, which was a hub for Christian missionaries under British rule, is now home to about 850,000 Christians and more than 1,500 churches. Many members of the middle and upper classes are Christians or studied at Catholic schools.
Chan Shun-hing, a professor of religion and philosophy at Hong Kong Baptist University, said the involvement of churches conferred on the protesters an image of nonviolence and morality.
“Christians still enjoy a very good reputation in society,” he said. “Whenever they talk, people will side with their positions.”
Alan Leong, the chairman of the pro-democracy Civic Party, said his religion had given him hope in taking on adversaries that seemed much bigger, like the Chinese Communist Party.
“On the face of it, it seems that you are no match for this ruthless power,” he said.
While pro-democracy protesters have in the past sometimes mocked Christian activists as zealots, many people of differing beliefs have rallied behind church leaders in the recent protests. 
Alex Auyeung, a 27-year-old counselor, is not religious. But after participating in the , he visited a small church.
Mr. Auyeung arrived with difficult questions. Was it possible to overcome intense dislike for the police and to see them as human? Was a mob mentality among protesters prevailing online? What does forgiveness mean?
“We are at a very fragile moment,” he said. “We need to bring calmness and wisdom to people.”
He read from Corinthians, clasped his hands and bowed down to pray.

The New York Times ,2019-08-14,Is a Crackdown Coming in Hong Kong _,1057 ,"
Beijing doesn’t want to intervene. But its own propaganda efforts may force Xi Jinping’s hand.
With the Hong Kong government paralyzed by mass protests, the chances of armed intervention from Beijing, once unthinkable, are rising by the day.
Far from hiding its intent, Beijing has been parading it in full view over the past week. The protesters, initially reviled as mobs, have been rebranded by Chinese officials as criminals and terrorists. The state media has broadcast ominous footage of its anti-riot police, who fall under the command of the People’s Liberation Army, marshaled on the Hong Kong border in Shenzhen.
To be sure, the threats against the protesters are designed to ensure that Beijing never has to carry them through. By displaying their fury and firepower, Chinese leaders are hoping the protesters will retreat.
But Beijing’s long-term management of Hong Kong and the internal logic of its own politics mean that President Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party have few offramps to dial down the conflict, even if they might well wish to.
Beijing doesn’t have to be reminded about the disastrous road it is heading down. The fallout from its use of military force in 1989 to clear demonstrators out of central Beijing and other cities has reverberated for decades in elite politics and the military in China, as well as overseas, where the crackdown lives on as a symbol of repressive Communist Party rule.
China has learned a lot since then about how to better manage protests within its own borders. A highly trained paramilitary force, the People’s Armed Police, now takes the lead in dealing with local disturbances. With the P.A.P.’s help, the authorities’ priority is to unwind any demonstrations with minimal violence and disperse protesters before unrest spreads.
Most important, propaganda department directives tightly manage the reporting of protests in the domestic Chinese media, to ensure that grievances aired in one locality don’t spread nationally and gain a momentum of their own.
There is no containing the protests in Hong Kong, however. The former British colony has a vigorous media, in both Chinese and English, scores of international journalists, a boisterous civil society, an unimpeded internet — for the moment at least — and tens of thousands of citizen journalists recording events on their mobile phones.
Hong Kong’s insurrection won’t be quelled with the imprisonment of a few students. One way or another, it will go on and on. As effective as the party’s well-honed protest management techniques are on the mainland, they won’t work in Hong Kong.
The party initially ordered the Chinese media not to cover the protests at all. Over the past week, however, it has discarded that approach and begun to push a narrative for its own citizens, of how anti-China activists in Hong Kong have joined forces with malevolent foreigners like the C.I.A.
State media have also ominously compared the protests to a “color revolution,” the collective term for the protests that took place in the early years of the century and toppled many governments in parts of the former Soviet Union and the Balkans and, a decade later, in the Middle East.
Communist Party officials are forced to study the history of these upheavals and how they were manipulated by foreign governments, especially the United States government, to bring down unfriendly regimes. “Color revolutions,” in other words, are synonymous with regime change in the eyes of the party and must be snuffed out before the disease spreads, in this case, to mainland China itself.
In portraying the protests as a “color revolution” that is trampling on Chinese sovereignty, the party-state may have set the wheels in motion to act in a way that any cool assessment would advise against.
In shifting to a hard-line stance on trade against the United States in recent months, Mr. Xi cleverly anticipated a coming nationalistic backlash in the Politburo against what many had come to see as the Trump administration’s overreach. In China, no leader can afford to vacate the commanding heights of nationalism nor stumble in standing firm against the predations of foreigners.
The same rule applies here, where Beijing, according to its own propaganda, is battling not just Hong Kong’s young hotheads but also the foreigners manipulating them.
Mr. Xi still has the power and the status to set his own course on Hong Kong. But the risk is that the same nationalist dynamic that took root in the trade dispute may now force his hand here as well. The deep disdain that many mainlanders have for Hong Kong, which many regard as a pampered enclave, only reinforces this sentiment.
At some point, the need to punish the protesters for their desecration of Beijing and the affront they represent to the Communist Party will begin to outweigh in internal political calculations the downside of intervention.
It is hard to say where that point lies. The protesters’ takeover of Hong Kong Airport this week seemed for a moment to have bought the crisis to a head. But the secrecy surrounding top-level Chinese politics makes the leaders’ next move hard to predict. China can’t send in the tanks, as it did in 1989. Hong Kong’s hilly topography makes that impossible even if it wanted to. But Beijing could send in anti-riot police to work along their Hong Kong counterparts.
Only Mr. Xi can authorize the offering of an olive branch to the protesters. Even a small concession, however, will be portrayed as giving in.
For someone seen as an all-powerful leader — the “chairman of everything,” as he is called — that might be a bridge too far. Without seduction in his arsenal, Mr. Xi may have to resort to force.

The New York Times ,2019-08-13,China Is Waging a Disinformation War Against Hong Kong Protesters,1537 ,"
BEIJING — When a projectile struck a Hong Kong woman in the eye this week as protesters clashed with the police, China responded quickly: Its state television network reported that the woman had been injured not by one of the police’s bean bag rounds, but by a protester.
: It posted what it said was a photo of the woman counting out cash on a Hong Kong sidewalk — insinuating, as Chinese reports have claimed before, that the protesters are merely paid provocateurs.
The assertion was more than just spin or fake news. The Communist Party exerts overwhelming control over media content inside China’s so-called Great Firewall, and it is now using it as a cudgel in an information war over  for months.
In recent days, China has more aggressively stirred up nationalist and anti-Western sentiment using state and social media, and it has manipulated the context of images and videos to undermine the protesters. Chinese officials have begun branding the demonstrations as a prelude to terrorism.
The result, both in mainland China and abroad, has been to create an alternate version of what, seen from Hong Kong, is clearly a popular demonstration movement. In China’s version, a small, violent gang of protesters, unsupported by residents and provoked by foreign agents, is running rampant, calling for Hong Kong’s independence and tearing China apart.
This narrative almost certainly reflects that of the country’s leaders, including Xi Jinping, and it is fueling misunderstanding — and, increasingly, anger — among the Chinese public. That could, in turn, raise pressure on the government, increasing the risk of an overreaction or miscalculation based on limited or inaccurate information.
People posting on Weibo, a Chinese social media service similar to Twitter, are increasingly calling for Beijing to act. “,” one person said about protesters on Tuesday, echoing an increasingly common sentiment on Weibo. “They must be beaten to death. Just send a few tanks over to clean them up.”
Since China’s censors have the ability to quickly remove offending comments, the abundance of them suggests that the government is willing to tolerate the warning they deliver, however ominous it sounds.
China has long curated the content that it allows its citizens to see and read. Its new campaign has echoes of tactics used by other countries, principally Russia, to inundate domestic and international audiences with bursts of information, propaganda and, in some cases, outright disinformation.
“Propagandists observe each other across borders, and they learn from each other,” said Peter Pomerantsev, the author of “This is Not Propaganda,”  that describes how authoritarian governments have weaponized social media that were once hailed as harbingers for democratic ideals.
The disinformation has clearly been aimed at undermining sympathy for the Hong Kong protesters’ goals, which now include demands for greater democratic freedoms for the territory’s seven million residents.
Propaganda in the traditional sense, Mr. Pomerantsev said, would try to win over an audience, while disinformation is meant simply to sow confusion and fuel conspiracies.
“You have to smother everything with doubt, and conspiracy is very effective in creating that,” Mr. Pomerantsev said in a telephone interview.
Though China’s disinformation network has received less global attention than Russia’s, the country’s officials have, over the last decade, built a machinery of online controls that far exceed any other country’s.
Many overseas websites are blocked in China. Censors embedded within its internet companies delete anything unacceptable. The police have arrested people who speak out of turn in chat groups, or who share sensitive content online.
The state media — whose history of propagandizing stretches back to Mao Zedong’s era — have also made powerful inroads in the new media online, filling the mainland’s information vacuum with an officially Sinicized worldview.
Hong Kong, which Britain returned to Chinese rule in 1997, remains outside China’s firewall, and thus is sitting along one of the world’s most profound online divides. Preserving the city’s freedom to live without the mainland’s controls has become one of the causes now motivating the protests.
“Deep inside, mainlanders and Hong Kong people have very different life experiences and emotions,” said Fang Kecheng, an assistant professor of journalism at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “Without the shared emotions, it’s not easy for mainlanders — even those who can freely access information — to empathize with Hong Kong people, which is an important explanation for how the government has been able to create a parallel universe of narratives.”
China’s new aggressiveness in the effort represents a shift in tactics. When large protests erupted in June over the Hong Kong government’s proposed law allowing the extradition of criminal suspects to the mainland, China’s state media — and officials — largely ignored them.
That changed on July 1, when protesters stormed Hong Kong’s Legislative Council building after a day of peaceful demonstrations. A flurry of articles and editorials in China’s state media followed, condemning the vandalism and violence — without explaining what the protesters were protesting about.
Since then, the state media have vigorously defended the police in Hong Kong, belittled the protesters and accused Westerners of orchestrating the turmoil. Efforts to contextualize the situation or express sympathy for the protesters were swiftly purged from social media.
The propaganda campaign intensified after July 21, when protesters surrounded the Chinese government’s main office in Hong Kong and threw black ink on a government emblem. And when a Chinese flag was thrown into Victoria Harbor on Aug. 3, the reaction in China — at least online, stoked by state media — reached a fevered pitch.
“The five-star flag has 1.4 billion guardians,” CCTV wrote indignantly to its 87 million followers on Weibo. “Repost! ‘I am a guardian of the flag!’ ”
It was reposted by more than 10 million people, including . On Twitter, which is banned in China, the People’s Daily later reposted CCTV’s original post, giving it an international audience.
Just across the border from Hong Kong, in the city of Shenzhen, the Chinese security forces have conducted large-scale operations in recent days, in a nationalistic display that got prominent coverage in the state media.
Other media reports have been outright deceptive.  used in Airsoft — a             that is popular in Hong Kong. The China Daily, a newspaper of the Communist Party, circulated it widely as evidence that the protesters had taken up arms, identifying the toy as an M320 grenade launcher used by the United States Army.
“What is the difference between this and the terrorists!” read one reply. “How long must we tolerate this?”
“What Is America Up To?” has become a hashtag promoted by CCTV on social media, according to Manya Koetse, the editor of , a site that monitors trends on the platform. Other posts celebrate the Hong Kong police as embattled heroes, while Hong Kong residents are regularly portrayed as spoiled.
The yawning power imbalance, from an information-warfare point of view, has frustrated many protesters as they try to outline their demands and clarify what has actually happened in the streets.
During a peaceful sit-in at Hong Kong’s airport late last month, protesters sought to explain their demands to arriving passengers, including travelers from the mainland. But the Chinese media promoted a video of a few protesters harassing a white-haired traveler who had ripped a poster out of a demonstrator’s hands.
“Witness said the old man refused to take leaflet demonstrators gave out. I think old people don’t deserve this no matter what is the reason,” , with a video that only showed protesters confronting the man.
“These young people have lost all compassion for political frenzy,” he added.

The New York Times ,2019-08-07,U.S. Issues Travel Warning for Hong Kong Due to _Confrontational_ Protests,474 ,"
HONG KONG — The United States on Wednesday issued an advisory warning people about traveling to Hong Kong, urging visitors to “exercise increased caution” because of “confrontational” protests in the semiautonomous Chinese territory.
The  comes two days after a general strike and widespread demonstrations shook the city, and as Chinese officials have warned about the continuing unrest.
“Since June 2019, several large scale and smaller political demonstrations have taken place in various areas of Hong Kong,” the advisory warned. “Most have been peaceful, but some have turned confrontational or resulted in violent clashes. The protests and confrontations have spilled over into neighborhoods other than those where the police have permitted marches or rallies. These demonstrations, which can take place with little or no notice, are likely to continue.”
Several other countries, including , Britain,            ,            , and            , have issued similar travel warnings.
Protests are planned starting Friday at Hong Kong’s airport, which could disrupt travel to and from the city. And the city has been roiled by daily demonstrations that have led the police to fire tear gas, rubber bullets and bean bag rounds at protesters.
The Hong Kong government said Thursday that the city remained a welcoming place for visitors and had a long tradition of peaceful protests.
“However, in recent weeks, some violent protesters have blocked roadways, vandalized property and confronted police after the end of some processions,” the government said in a written statement. “The impact of these illegal confrontations is confined to a limited area near the procession routes, and is not widespread.”
On Wednesday, the top Chinese official overseeing Hong Kong affairs said that the city was experiencing its worst crisis since the former British colony returned to China in 1997. The official, Zhang Xiaoming, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said the turmoil in Hong Kong “has been going on for 60 days straight, getting bigger and bigger,” and added that violence had been intensifying.
The advisory urged travelers to the city to “avoid the areas of the demonstrations,” “keep a low profile” and “exercise caution if unexpectedly in the vicinity of large gatherings or protests.”

The New York Times ,2019-07-08,Hong Kong Protesters Are Fueled by a Broader Demand_ More Democracy,1413 ,"
HONG KONG — When hundreds of thousands of people in Hong Kong peacefully took to the streets last month, they had a few specific demands, including the withdrawal of an unpopular bill and an investigation into police abuse. In recent days, they added another call: the right to direct elections.
This latest demand brought into focus the issue that has been quietly seething at the heart of the protests: Hong Kong’s increasingly fraught relationship with mainland China and the authoritarian ruling Communist Party.
That longstanding anxiety flared last week when a small group of demonstrators , blacked out the name for mainland China from Hong Kong’s official emblem and spray-painted slogans calling for universal suffrage.
It was a dramatic rebuke of a political system that protesters say created a ruling class that has become more beholden to Beijing than to Hong Kong since the former British colony’s return to Chinese rule 22 years ago. The protesters’ forceful charging of the legislature brought this anger so jarringly to the fore that even a few members of the pro-establishment camp have urged the government in recent days to revisit steps toward political reforms.
The city’s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, asserted on Tuesday that the bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China was “dead” and would not be revived. But she also acknowledged that the protests were driven by broader problems dating to a failed 2014 pro-democracy movement that sought genuine, freer elections.
On Sunday, when tens of thousands of protesters once again , they also called for the legislature to be dismissed and for free elections.
“Mainland China worries us the most,” said Patrick Luk, 37, an administrative staffer at a community college who joined the protest with his wife and 5-year-old son. That is why, he said, universal suffrage is his most important priority.
“They force people to adhere to their doctrines,” Mr. Luk added, referring to the Communist Party. “They want us to be faithful to them.”
The protests were piling pressure on Mrs. Lam, and a few pro-establishment politicians have  of her senior advisers. Mrs. Lam has             but not fully withdrawn it, and in a briefing with reporters on Tuesday did not indicate any willingness to make further concessions.
Asked if she would restart political reforms to give the people of Hong Kong universal suffrage, Mrs. Lam sidestepped the question, but acknowledged that there were “fundamental deep-seated problems” that could be related to the economy, cost of living or politics.
Protesters and pro-democracy lawmakers want to protect the high degree of autonomy Hong Kong was promised when it was returned to China in 1997 under a policy known as “one country, two systems.” That autonomy is guaranteed until 2047, but the Communist Party and its security apparatus have increasingly encroached on the territory.
The last sustained protest movement  ended in failure in 2014. Since then, Beijing has intervened to             elected to Hong Kong’s legislature, a major setback for the opposition. Several others were disqualified from running in local elections by officials who questioned the sincerity of their belief that Hong Kong is an “inalienable part” of China.
As a result, protesters and experts say, the political playing field is so far out of balance that many of Hong Kong’s youth have felt shut out, and blame the generations of politicians before them for compromising their futures for the sake of seeking Beijing’s favor.
The experts and protesters say this may help explain why, when those frustrations boiled over at the legislature last week, many others in the movement remained sympathetic, seeing it as a culmination of years of pent-up anger.
“At first, I was shocked by their behavior too, but then I understood,” said Candy Wong, 56, a dentist and mother of two who joined a rally of thousands of parents on Friday to express support for the protesters.
“Those young people are not rioters,” Ms. Wong added. “They have tried everything else to make the government listen, but nothing has worked.”
Some politicians in the pro-establishment camp, possibly with an eye on future elections, have also spoken out about the need for the government to tackle the political structure that is the root cause of the protesters’ anger.
Jasper Tsang, a former president of the Legislative Council and a founding member of the largest pro-Beijing party in Hong Kong, turned heads last week when he raised the possibility of revisiting the debate over political reform.
“One of the main reasons there is so much anger is that the Hong Kong people, especially the youth, haven’t been given any hope for universal suffrage,” Mr. Tsang , a local news site.
Ronny Tong, a lawyer and member of the chief executive’s top advisory body, the Executive Council, echoed that suggestion.
“If the current difficulty in some way is caused by a failure of political reform, then we should consider bringing back political reform,” Mr. Tong said in an interview. He added that if the democratic lawmakers agreed to talk without any preconditions, he could “guarantee that the Hong Kong government would be willing to do just that.”
, an assistant professor of political science at Lingnan University in Hong Kong who studies local social movements, said most protesters agreed that Hong Kong needed more democracy but that some were concerned it could distract from the movement’s more achievable demands.
“There have been a lot of splits even within the protesters regarding whether people should shift their demands to asking for democracy because that’s not what this movement is for,” Mr. Yuen said.
There is also the question of what political reform would even look like. Beijing once offered a form of direct elections that would have allowed the public to elect Hong Kong’s chief executive from a slate of two or three preapproved candidates.
But pro-democracy legislators , and Beijing’s supporters in the legislature said then that the Communist Party was unlikely to offer more generous terms. Since then, Hong Kong has continued to rely on a 1,200-member committee heavily weighted in Beijing’s favor to pick its chief executive.
In an editorial on Monday, the pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Wen Wei Po  for universal suffrage as irrelevant and having no legal basis. The paper argued that no city leader or government would “be able to, or have the authority to” agree to such a demand.
Last week, Lau Siu-kai, vice chairman of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, a semiofficial research institute with ties to Beijing,  that any debate on political reform would only “further divide society.”
The way to resolve the issue is to improve the government’s communication with the public, Mr. Lau and others said.
“None of our leaders have been able to articulate a vision of our future under ‘one country, two systems’ which has been inspiring to our young people,” said Regina Ip, a pro-establishment lawmaker and another member of the Executive Council.
Calls for political reforms  under Xi Jinping, who has strengthened authoritarian controls across China since coming to power in 2012, experts said.
Mr. Xi has already made an extraordinary concession to the protesters by allowing Mrs. Lam to suspend the bill, said , an associate professor of government at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. So the chances that Mr. Xi would agree to political reforms, Mr. Ma said, are slim.
“Given that the entire country is still well on the road to full autocratic rule,” Mr. Ma said, “it’s unlikely they would initiate any kind of liberalization in Hong Kong.”

The New York Times ,2019-06-12,"Russian Police Arrest Hundreds at Protest, Including Navalny, After Reporter_s Release",773 ,"
MOSCOW — The Moscow police arrested about 400 people, including the country’s main opposition leader, during a street protest on Wednesday against abusive police tactics.
At an event where the outcome, mass arrests, seemed only to confirm the protesters’ complaints, riot police dragged demonstrators from the crowd seemingly at random and arrested news photographers and reporters.
The police said more than 200 protesters had been detained. OVD Info, an independent group monitoring arrests, said more than 400 had been arrested. Among them was 
Organizers had called the protest to support a Russian journalist, Ivan Golunov, whom supporters say the police had framed on drug charges last week. Pictures produced by the police that seemed to show a drug lab in the reporter’s apartment had been faked. , the authorities released Mr. Golunov on Tuesday, acknowledged that there was no evidence to support the charges and opened an investigation into the police who had detained him.
That seemingly met the demands of the protest organizers. But several thousand people turned up anyway, saying the reporter’s release was just a ruse to defuse a protest or that police abuse was a problem wider than just his case.
The arrests on Wednesday “are a perfect example of the cruel repression that brought protesters to the streets in the first place,” Denis Krivosheev, deputy director for Amnesty International’s Eastern European and Central Asia Office, said in a statement.
In the crowd, the perception that the Russian police plant drugs on dissidents was widespread. It is a new form of political repression, participants said.
Tatyana Malshava, 40, who works in sales in a public-relation company, said she had come to protest police abuse of power such as fabricating evidence, even if Mr. Golunov’s case had been dropped.
“Just imagine how many people in Russia are in jail for nothing, for reasons invented by our government,” she said. “It’s a pity. Anyone can be a victim of such charges.”
Russian journalists numbering at least in the dozens turned up to take part in the demonstration, rather than to cover the event.
“Golunov was only an example of all the abuses bothering people,” said Tatyana Felgenhauer, an anchor at Echo of Moscow radio station. “Ivan is free, but the story isn’t over.”
The protest, though, ended quickly for hundreds of participants.
Sirens blaring, police vans sped through the warren of side streets and alleys in the old center of Moscow. Riot police hopped out, blocked sidewalks and arrested demonstrators.
The previous arrest of Mr. Golunov, the reporter, had touched a nerve in the Russian capital. Film and theater celebrities joined reporters in publicly condemning the clumsy frame job.
Mr. Golunov had been reporting on corruption in the funeral home industry. Russian families are often pressed to pay bribes to bury loved ones. The bribery racket has been shifting from organized crime groups to corrupt security service officials, Mr. Golunov reported before his arrest, and he had planned another article on the topic.
“The same thing happened to the funeral industry that’s happened with the rest of the Russian economy,” Mr. Golunov wrote  in Meduza, an online news portal. “State officials purged the market and forced its previous masters to the periphery.”
The police in Russia have routinely plowed ahead with dubious cases against people who expose the government to scrutiny or ridicule, but for unclear reasons, the Ministry of Interior shifted tack this time and dropped all charges against Mr. Golunov.
The zigzag on Mr. Golunov’s case came as economic stagnation has taken a bite out of Russians’ well-being, and as  has broken out in Russian provincial cities, often over local issues related to            . In other instances, the authorities have settled on compromises to defuse protests, as some demonstrators suggested Mr. Golunov’s release was intended to do.
The shift in his case also came during a period of apparent infighting at the Federal Security Service, the successor to the K.G.B.; a senior officer overseeing banking was arrested this year, for example. That context suggests that one faction intended to use the episode to damage another.

The New York Times ,2019-08-19,Facebook and Twitter Say China Is Spreading Disinformation in Hong Kong,1441 ,"
SAN FRANCISCO — China has adopted Russia’s playbook for spreading disinformation on Facebook and Twitter, deploying those tactics in its  over the protests that have convulsed Hong Kong.
In recent weeks, Facebook and Twitter accounts that originated in China acted in a coordinated fashion to amplify messages and images that portrayed Hong Kong’s protesters as violent and extreme, the two social media companies said on Monday. , one recent post from a China-linked account likened the protesters to ISIS fighters. And a Twitter message said, “We don’t want you radical people in Hong Kong. Just get out of here!”
Facebook and Twitter said they had now removed the accounts, the first time that the social media companies have had to take down accounts linked to disinformation in China.
Facebook said it eliminated seven pages, three Facebook Groups and five accounts involved in the disinformation campaign about Hong Kong protesters. Twitter deleted  and said it would ban state-backed media from promoting tweets after China Daily and other state-backed publications placed ads on its service that suggested the protesters were sponsored by Western interests and were becoming violent.
“These accounts were deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong, including undermining the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement on the ground,” Twitter said in a statement. “Based on our intensive investigations, we have reliable evidence to support that this is a coordinated state-backed operation.”
The removal of the China-backed accounts signal an escalation in the global disinformation wars. In 2015 and 2016, Russia pioneered disinformation techniques , Twitter, Instagram and other social media to disseminate inflammatory messages intended to divide Americans in the 2016 presidential election. Since then, governments in             — including Bangladesh, Iran and Venezuela — have also used Facebook and Twitter to sow discord at home and abroad.
China has been less visible about using Facebook and Twitter to spread disinformation, researchers said. Both services are blocked in the country and people instead spend time on homegrown social media services and messaging apps like WeChat and Weibo. The Communist Party has largely not needed Western social media because it already exerts tight control over state-backed media and content inside the country’s so-called Great Firewall.
But the recent Facebook and Twitter activity over the Hong Kong protests suggests that Beijing will use those services to spread its messaging outside the Great Firewall when it deems it necessary. Facebook and Twitter are not blocked in Hong Kong and are widely used. Some 4.7 million people in the territory log into Facebook at least once a month, while 448,000 use Twitter, according to eMarketer.
Asked about the actions by Twitter and Facebook, Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Tuesday that Chinese media outlets were doing nothing underhanded in sharing their views about the Hong Kong protests.
“I think it‘s entirely reasonable for Chinese media to use social media platforms abroad to engage with the public to explain China’s policies and tell China’s story,” Mr. Geng told a regular news conference in Beijing. “I don’t understand why certain companies or certain people have such an intense reaction. Maybe it’s poked holes in their own shortcomings.”
China may have previously dipped its toe into using Western social media to destabilize elections in Taiwan starting in 2018, said Graham Brookie, the director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. He added that China’s disinformation campaigns tended to be less wide-ranging than Russia’s and hew tightly to a set of foreign policy goals, including tying Taiwan and Hong Kong closely to the mainland.
“The Chinese have been watching what works and what doesn’t in the context of Russian information operations,” Mr. Brookie said. “China is testing the waters on what is effective and what they can get away with.”
The disinformation campaign against the Hong Kong protests also stands out because many of the tweets were written in English and targeted a global audience.
“I think they are trying to reach English speakers in Hong Kong and the larger audience of people watching,” said Adam Segal, director of the Digital and Cyberspace Policy Program at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Many of the Twitter accounts involved in the Hong Kong campaign were recently created and did not have large followings, said Renee DiResta, the Mozilla Fellow in media, misinformation and trust. “It reveals almost a lack of sophistication in terms of how China is thinking about developing this outward capability,” she said.
Since the Hong Kong protests began in June to demonstrate against an extradition bill, the movement has evolved. On Sunday, , which organizers said brought out 1.7 million people — or nearly one in four of the total population of around seven million — who walked in defiance of a police ban.
China has aggressively stoked anti-Western and nationalist sentiments around the protests and begun branding the demonstrations as a prelude to terrorism. Hong Kong workers and billionaires have also jumped into the fray. In ads in several local newspapers, the tycoon Li Ka Shing recently pushed readers to “love China, love Hong Kong, love yourself” and “overcome anger with love.” And employees at accounting firms in Hong Kong  supporting the demonstrations.
Twitter said it discovered the China-linked accounts during an investigation that spanned several weeks. The accounts worked together to blast out messages that could undermine the Hong Kong protests, with some of the accounts using Twitter from specific unblocked internet protocol addresses, the company said. Since Twitter is not permitted in China, an unblocked IP address is typically a telltale sign that the accounts were approved by the government, researchers said.
Although most of the disinformation was spread by the 936 accounts that Twitter eventually took down, the company said it also uncovered a broader group of 200,000 accounts. Those sprang up once Twitter began banning some of the earlier accounts; the majority of them were stopped before they were able to spread more messages, the company said.
Among the messages that the China-linked accounts posted was a tweet suggesting protesters were “taking benefits from the bad guys.” Another claimed the protesters had “ulterior motives.”
Twitter said it would give state-sponsored media a month to leave its advertising platform before its ban on promoted tweets from state-backed media goes into effect. The ban expands on the company’s efforts to combat Russian disinformation. In 2017, Twitter banned, international news outlets supported by the Kremlin, from advertising on its service.
Unlike Twitter, Facebook said it would not ban ads from state-owned media. The company said it would “continue to look at our policies as they relate to state-owned media” and also closely examine ads that were flagged to it so it could determine if they violated its policies. China’s government, through its state media agencies, has been a big buyer of ads on Facebook, .
Twitter alerted Facebook to the coordinated China-linked social media activity in July, a Facebook spokeswoman said. The Facebook pages that the company identified in its own investigation typically posed as news organizations and were followed by about 15,500 accounts. Most of the pages were created in 2018 or later, with the earliest page flagged in the investigation set up in 2016. While the people behind the activity tried to hide their identities, Facebook said it “found links to individuals associated with the Chinese government.”
“Protesters, ISIS fighters,” one of the Facebook posts said, “What’s the difference?” Another called the protesters “Hong Kong cockroaches.”

The New York Times ,2019-08-05,"Hong Kong Strike Sinks City Into Chaos, and Government Has Little Reply",1579 ,"
HONG KONG — Antigovernment protesters in Hong Kong mounted their fiercest challenge to the authorities on Monday, disrupting more than 200 airline flights, occupying malls and blocking roadways and rail lines to snarl the commute for hundreds of thousands of workers.
The protesters called for a general strike in an effort to halt daily life across the semiautonomous Chinese territory, wielding a potentially powerful new tool in their weekslong campaign against the Hong Kong government.
Hong Kong’s values of efficiency, hard work and, increasingly, a dedication to public protest are colliding as protesters from across society test the limits of the city’s police force. Officers on Monday fired tear gas near shopping malls and residential areas and arrested at least 82 people, while the city’s leader warned that efforts to “topple Hong Kong” could destroy livelihoods and push the city “to the verge of a very dangerous situation.”
Monday was the last of three consecutive days of large-scale civil disobedience intended to increase pressure on the government as it confronts Hong Kong’s worst political crisis since 1997, when it was returned to Chinese rule after more than 150 years as a British colony.
Many protesters said they felt they had no choice but to escalate their actions after the government was unswayed by peaceful marches in June that organizers said drew as many as .
The protests began nearly two months ago in response to legislation, since suspended, that would allow criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the governing Communist Party. The movement, which has been driven by longstanding fears of deteriorating freedoms under Beijing’s rule, has expanded to include a variety of grievances, including the stalled expansion of direct elections and accusations of excessive force by the police.
It was unclear how many people heeded the call to strike. But protesters began the day by blocking roads and train doors using flash-mob-style tactics, while more than 200 flights at the city’s international airport were canceled as large numbers of air traffic controllers called in sick. An estimated 2,300 people in the civil aviation industry participated in the strike, according to the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions.
Mass rallies were held at more than half a dozen sites, including outside the government headquarters on Hong Kong’s main island. Officers fired tear gas at several locations across the city.
Later in the evening, protesters in the North Point neighborhood on eastern Hong Kong Island were briefly attacked by men wearing white shirts and wielding sticks in a scene reminiscent of July 21, when a pro-Beijing mob beat protesters and bystanders in the satellite town of Yuen Long.
Since the protests began in early June, the police have arrested 420 people and fired 1,000 rounds of tear gas, a spokesman said Monday.
That is significantly more than during Hong Kong’s last sustained protest movement in 2014, when the use of tear gas against pro-democracy demonstrators galvanized the public in support of a sit-in that lasted 79 days. The police fired a total of 87 tear gas canisters then, and only on that first night.
In recent weeks, the protesters’ anger has largely shifted to focus on the scale and intensity of the police response. On Monday they surrounded and vandalized several police stations, setting fires outside at least two of them. Supporters say the police have regularly shown restraint.
Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, warned Monday morning in her first public remarks in two weeks that the city “has become unsafe and unstable” and that “a series of extremely violent acts are pushing Hong Kong into very precarious circumstances.”
Mrs. Lam accused protesters of challenging Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong, citing a slogan some of them chanted that is associated with  who at one point advocated Hong Kong independence.
“They want to topple Hong Kong, to thoroughly destroy the livelihoods that seven million people cherish,” she said.
Mrs. Lam is under pressure from China’s central government to bring the protests under control, and the Chinese military . The Hong Kong government has repeatedly denied plans to make any such request.
The response by Hong Kong officials to the strike on Monday “was a disaster,” said Antony Dapiran, a Hong Kong-based lawyer and the author of a book about dissent in Hong Kong. “They came out with a fairly hard line, no concessions, nothing new.”
Mrs. Lam even faced criticism from establishment lawmakers. She “raised many questions at the news conference, but where are the solutions?” Ann Chiang, a lawmaker from Hong Kong’s largest pro-Beijing party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, wrote on Facebook. “Disappointing!!!”
Mainland Chinese officials responsible for Hong Kong policy are scheduled to hold a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. On Wednesday, they will meet with Hong Kong delegates to the Chinese national congress in Shenzhen, just across the mainland border, the Hong Kong public broadcaster RTHK reported.
The Hong Kong government also warned Monday that the unrest was affecting the local economy, including sales of luxury goods as mainland visitors choose to avoid the city, a concern that will garner little sympathy from protesters. Hong Kong stocks declined by almost 3 percent on Monday.
“The movement has had a lot of impact on Hong Kong, the operation of the whole economy and the operation of many industries and businesses,” said Ivan Choy, a senior lecturer in government and public administration at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “But I think this is the right of Hong Kong people to demand more freedom and more justice in society.”
Some commuters complained about the transportation delays and confronted protesters. Vehicles plowed through barriers set up by protesters along roadways at least twice, sending demonstrators diving for safety. But even those facing delays said the government was to blame for failing to address public grievances.
“Carrie Lam has caused my absence today,” said Dancus Au, 24, an employee at a security company who was stuck in a subway station for hours in the morning.
He said Mrs. Lam had made a mistake by merely  rather than formally withdrawing it, as protesters have demanded.
“She should have said ‘withdraw’ at the beginning of this fiasco,” he said. “She is part of the root cause, while Beijing is another part of it.”
Labor unions said hundreds of thousands may have joined the strike, and some groups, like workers at Hong Kong Disneyland, did announce work stoppages. Others took a day of leave or called in sick to join the protests. After weeks of protests led largely by people in their teens and twenties, the general strike was seen as a way for middle-aged supporters of the movement to participate.
Janice Lau, a 38-year-old teacher, pumped her fist in the air in encouragement as she and her 6-year-old daughter, Zoe, watched protesters drag steel barricades to block traffic near the government headquarters in the Admiralty district.
“I’m proud of them,’’ she said. “Society forced them to do this, and they didn’t harm the society. These days, people are more afraid when the police appear than when protesters appear.”
Some businesses also closed. The Hong Kong Jockey Club, which has a government-granted monopoly on gambling, announced that off-site betting facilities would stop taking wagers by 6 p.m., citing safety concerns. At two luxury malls, Pacific Place in Admiralty and Lee Gardens in Causeway Bay, many shops were closed.
Chinese state media outlets, which have grown increasingly vocal in their condemnation of the protests, renewed their criticism on Monday.
The People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s outlet,  who had thrown a Chinese flag into the Hong Kong harbor over the weekend, accusing them of wanting to end the “one country, two systems” arrangement that defines the relationship between Hong Kong and Beijing. Mrs. Lam also mentioned the incident in her remarks on Monday.
Since protesters started to increasingly target police stations this past weekend, officers have appeared to be more aggressive in making arrests. But the increased assertiveness risked further inflaming public sentiment, and at least one protest not originally scheduled for Monday was driven by anger over an earlier arrest.
“For me the most alarming thing is we’re kind of on a knife’s edge here — open disrespect for the police, police stations being targeted,” Mr. Dapiran said. “We are on the cusp of what could be a general breakdown of law and order. It hasn’t gotten there yet, but the government hasn’t done anything to stop it.”

The New York Times ,2019-10-29,"Hong Kong Bars Joshua Wong, a Prominent Activist, From Seeking Election",872 ,"
Mr. Wong, a leader of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, had planned to run for a district council position amid widespread public anger with the government. 
HONG KONG — The  authorities on Tuesday barred            , from running in district council elections next month, a blow to the             movement’s efforts to convert deep anger toward the authorities into electoral gains.
The government cited statements by Mr. Wong’s political organization that the future of  should be determined by its people, and independence is a possible option. An official said those statements were incompatible with the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, which states that the semiautonomous city is part of China.
“The candidate cannot possibly comply with the requirements of the relevant electoral laws, since advocating or promoting ‘self-determination’ is contrary to the content of the declaration that the law requires a candidate to make to uphold the Basic Law and pledge allegiance” to , the government said in a statement.
Mr. Wong said the decision showed that China’s central government was manipulating the election, which is expected to be a key test of public sentiment about the movement.
In a news conference outside the Hong Kong government headquarters, he called the decision to bar him “a political order that Beijing has handed down.”
 Earlier he said that the official who made the decision had been relegated to a role as the “thought police.”
The district council elections, which will be held on Nov. 24, are usually focused on local issues such as bus stops and neighborhood beautification. But the race is taking on a broader political significance this year. Whichever side wins the most seats will control 117 votes in the 1,200-member election committee that chooses the next chief executive, Hong Kong’s top government position.
The pro-democracy camp’s fears of even wider prohibitions on their candidates seeking office have not been realized, as Mr. Wong will most likely be the only candidate barred from the district council race.
He said Tuesday that he hoped voters would support another candidate, Kelvin Lam, who had registered to run in the event of Mr. Wong’s disqualification.
Mr. Wong, 23, grew to international prominence as , when protesters occupied streets for weeks to push for freer elections. He was sentenced to short prison terms twice over the 2014 protests, and was still in custody in June when the current protest movement began.
The current protest movement began as a fight over a now-withdrawn extradition bill and has expanded its demands to include an investigation into use of force by the police and direct elections for the chief executive and the entire Legislative Council. 
Unlike 2014, there are no widely known protest leaders. But Mr. Wong has remained a prominent participant and has been regularly attacked in the state-run Chinese media. In August, another 2014 protest leader who belongs to the same political group, Demosisto, were arrested on unauthorized assembly charges for a June 21 protest, when thousands of protesters surrounded police headquarters.
Ms. Chow  over similar questions of support for self-determination, including an option for independence. She won an appeal last month, with a judge ruling that she had insufficient opportunity to respond to the grounds for disqualification. 
Ms. Chow said that ruling was a “Pyrrhic victory,” because it still upheld the ability of officials to disqualify candidates based on their political beliefs.
Mr. Wong had previously publicly shared his response to the official who disqualified him, Laura Aron, on Facebook on Saturday, where he argued that his advocacy remains within the bounds of the city’s Constitution.
“My position is that any decision on Hong Kong’s future should be carried out within the constitutional framework of ‘one country, two systems,’” he wrote. “Supporting democratic self-determination does not mean supporting Hong Kong’s independence from the central government of the People’s Republic of China.”
He added that comments two weeks ago by China’s leader, Xi Jinping, that any effort to divide the country would end in failure showed the futility of upholding such a position.
When Mr. Xi “threatened in strong terms that ‘anyone attempting to split China in any part of the country will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones,’ I believe that in reality Hong Kong independence cannot become an acceptable option,” Mr. Wong wrote.
Ms. Aron wrote in her decision that by referring to Mr. Xi’s comments, Mr. Wong suggested that “both Demosisto and he were pressed into saying that they have given up the notion as a compromise, instead of a genuine intention.”

The New York Times ,2019-11-10,Hong Kong Police Shoot Protester Amid Clashes,1152 ,"
Demonstrators disrupted the transit system, part of a broader call for action after the death of a student and the arrest of six pro-democracy lawmakers.
HONG KONG — A  officer shot an antigovernment demonstrator on Monday, an escalation that quickly inflamed tensions in the city already jittery over the . 
The officer fired several shots on Monday morning toward two black-clad protesters in a neighborhood where traffic had been snarled by roadblocks. One of the protesters crumpled to the ground after being hit at point-blank range, , and appeared conscious afterward.
The shooting on Monday came as pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong blocked roads and scuffled with riot police officers across the city as part of what had been billed as a citywide general strike. 
It has been 23 weeks since protests began in the semiautonomous Chinese city over a contentious, but since-withdrawn, extradition bill.  have since morphed into calls for greater democracy and police accountability.
Here’s the latest on the Hong Kong protests:
After opening fire, an officer tackled a wounded protester.
The video shows a police officer in a white shirt and neon vest pulling his gun on a group of protesters surrounding him at an intersection in the Sai Wan Ho neighborhood. He fires several live rounds. 
“One round hit a man’s body, and he immediately fell to the ground, and there was blood on the ground,” Chan Cheuk-hin, a reporter for Cupid Producer who shot the video, told The New York Times. He said the shooting took place after 7 a.m. as the protesters blocked roads. 
The officer then tackles the protester he shot. The protester is seen lying quietly on the ground, surrounded by what appear to be pools of his own blood. Mr. Chan described him as seeming to be “semiconscious.” 
The police confirmed the shooting and said that front-line officers followed strict guidelines when discharging their firearms. The man who was shot was in critical condition, the city’s hospital authority said. 
Office workers joined the protesters in anger over the shooting.
Police officers were also out in force in the central business district, as protesters angry over the morning’s shooting snarled traffic on streets near City Hall. Some officers fired tear gas, sending pedestrians fleeing into luxury malls, gasping for air. 
Thousands of people gathered, many of them in suits and other office attire, and faced off with the police. “Die, cockroaches,” they yelled at a dozen officers who were walking toward a subway entrance. Nearby, other protesters shouted a popular slogan: “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong!” 
Marcus Lee, a 26-year-old lawyer in a charcoal gray suit with a blue face mask, stood outside a Giorgio Armani store with a group of protesters who were shouting at the police. 
“The gun wasn’t necessary, let alone firing shots,” he said, referring to the morning’s shooting. “You can see how people are reacting to this. They are angry. It’s just very ridiculous.” 
Later, thousands of protesters and office workers set off on a march around the business district.
Protesters disrupted traffic to pressure the government.
Antigovernment demonstrators blocked roads in several districts and appeared to force the suspension of some light rail services and delays on subway lines. The protesters had said that the demonstration was aimed at paralyzing public services to express their anger over the death of a student last week from a fall at a parking garage near a protest. 
The disruptions on Monday appeared to have less of an impact than . The actions were also timed to coincide with “Singles Day,” an annual  in mainland China that generates billions of dollars in sales. The protesters urged a boycott of online shopping.
In an internal memo on Monday, the bank HSBC, said that while it was still operating normally, it encouraged employees to “leave the office early and under safe conditions to your commute.” 
The protests quickly descended into clashes.
There were clashes across the city on Monday, including on some leafy university campuses, where protesters threw Molotov cocktails and riot police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets. 
In Ma On Shan, a rural part of northeastern Hong Kong, video footage circulating on Monday showed a man who appeared to be a government supporter being doused with flammable liquid and set on fire after arguing with a group of critics. 
“Go back to the Greater Bay Area!” the crowd shouted, using Beijing’s term for the region of southern China that includes Hong Kong and neighboring cities. The Hospital Authority later said that the man was in critical condition.
Farther south, in the Tseung Kwan O neighborhood, police officers in black uniforms and black masks chased activists from an intersection. The officers were carrying weapons marked with neon orange — presumably rifles loaded with sponge grenades. 
One officer raised his gun and fired at the back of a protester he was chasing. Onlookers started shouting at the officer. “Don’t open fire! You’re actually firing on people?” they said.
Nathan Tam, 53, a businessman who lives in Tseung Kwan O and was driving to Hong Kong Island on Monday morning, said he was commuting despite the disruptions because he had an afternoon meeting he couldn’t afford to miss.
Mr. Tam said he was thankful that his son was studying abroad in Britain. “Otherwise, with his personality, he would probably be protesting and getting shot at right now,” he said.
A police officer on a motorcycle swerved into protesters.

In the video, which local news outlets said had been recorded on Monday morning in the Kwai Fong district of northern Hong Kong, a crowd of black-clad protesters were seen retreating as the motorcycle wove through them at a slow speed. 
A student’s death provoked outrage and questions.
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people gathered at a park outside the Hong Kong government headquarters in memory of Chow Tsz-lok, 22, who died after falling from a parking garage amid protests last Monday. A constant stream of people left paper cranes and white flowers at a stage where speakers gave emotional addresses.
Mr. Chow, a student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, suffered head and pelvic injuries when he fell one story. Some protesters have blamed the police for his death, but the circumstances of his fall remain unclear.

The New York Times ,2019-08-12,Chaos Grips Hong Kong _s Airport as Police Clash With Protesters,1774 ,"
HONG KONG — Anti-government protesters clashed with Hong Kong riot police on Tuesday, crippling the airport for the second straight day and targeting a potent symbol of the city’s position as a global center of commerce and finance that is essential to China.
The mass protests have forced the airport to suspend check-ins, creating long delays for passengers and forcing airlines to cancel hundreds of flights over the past two days. After a chaotic night, check-ins resumed on Wednesday morning, but the airport warned that flights would be rescheduled, and Hong Kong’s flagship carrier said there could be “further flight disruptions at short notice.”
[.]
The protests at the airport have been deeply tactical, as the largely leaderless movement strikes at a vital economic artery. Hong Kong International Airport, which opened in 1998, a year after China reclaimed the territory from Britain, serves as a gateway to the rest of Asia. Sleek and well-run, the airport accommodates nearly 75 million passengers a year and handles more than 5.1 million metric tons of cargo.
The protesters are trying to intensify pressure on the government, which has refused to meet their demands. After earlier efforts to occupy local roads, shopping malls and parks failed to produce concessions, they decided to shift their efforts to a more global stage. At the airport, protesters have handed out pamphlets in different languages explaining their position.
Peter Tan, a 23-year-old student, said that protesters were sorry to inconvenience travelers, but that other tactics hadn’t worked. “We want to spread the message to them so that they can spread the message to their country,” he said. “We are trying to protect our rights and our city.”
The clashes began late in the evening, after a group of demonstrators attacked a man they accused of being a mainland Chinese police officer impersonating a protester. As medics and the police tried to evacuate him in an ambulance, protesters blocked a road outside the departure hall.
Some officers in riot gear then began running after demonstrators, wrestling some to the ground. A group of protesters inside surrounded a police officer, taking his baton and beating him with it. They retreated after he , according to video footage and a police statement.
The Hong Kong government, in a statement, condemned the protesters’ tactics, saying their “violent acts” at the airport “are outrageous and have overstepped the bottom line of a civilized society.” On Wednesday morning, the city’s airport authority said it had obtained a court injunction to prevent unlawful demonstrations there.
The disruptions are a direct affront to the Chinese leadership. The wave of protests began in June to oppose legislation that would have allowed extraditions to the mainland, where the courts are controlled by the Communist Party. Since then, they have evolved into a broader push to protect Hong Kong’s autonomy and civil liberties, including a call for free elections that would be nonstarter for Beijing.
[.]
In recent days, China has taken an increasingly hard stance, warning protesters in strident terms to stand down or face consequences. Beijing has also , portraying the demonstrators as violent gangsters whose activities are starting to look like terrorism.
President Trump said  on Tuesday that he had intelligence “that the Chinese government is moving troops to the border with Hong Kong.” But it was unclear what information, if any, Mr. Trump had.
While Chinese security forces have recently conducted large-scale operations across the border from Hong Kong in Shenzhen, they appear mainly to be a nationalistic show of force. The possibility that China would send its military to restore order still looks remote.
The city’s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, pleaded earlier on Tuesday for order after days of escalating street violence.
“The stability and well-being of seven million people are in jeopardy,” Mrs. Lam said, her voice breaking slightly. “Take a minute to think about that. Look at our city, our home. Do we really want to push our home to the abyss where it will be smashed into pieces?”
In the news conference, Mrs. Lam was frequently interrupted by journalists who demanded an explanation for what protesters have called police misconduct. She looked more visibly emotional than she has at other recent public appearances.
“Will you apologize to the girl?” one reporter asked, referring to a woman who was hit in her right eye by a projectile during protests on Sunday. While the police have not confirmed the cause of her injury, the incident, widely reported by local news media, has helped galvanize protests at the airport.
“Why have you never condemned the police?” another journalist asked.
Toward the end of the briefing, Mrs. Lam said that police operations were not determined by “someone like myself, who is outside the police.”
Local authorities have faced criticism from a broad cross-section of Hong Kong society for their use of force in the protests. During street clashes, the police have regularly fired tear gas, rubber bullets and bean bag rounds to disperse protesters, even in residential areas and crowded shopping districts.
On Sunday night, in addition to using tear gas in a train station, the police beat protesters and  at another station. The authorities, for their part, accused protesters of attacking officers with bricks and gasoline bombs.
On Tuesday, the United Nations’ human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, said there was evidence that the Hong Kong police had violated international standards for the use of less-lethal weapons like tear gas. In a statement, she condemned violence in any form, urging authorities to act with restraint.
China’s diplomatic mission in Geneva issued a testy rebuttal, expressing “deep dissatisfaction and firm opposition,” saying the comments sent the wrong signal to “violent criminal offenders.” It said Ms. Bachelet and the United Nations’ human rights office should stop interfering in Hong Kong and China’s domestic affairs.
Also on Tuesday, medical professionals held rallies at several local hospitals to protest against the police tactics and in solidarity with the woman who was hit in the eye on Sunday.
The rallies are a “direct response to what happened on Sunday,” Dr. Alfred Wong, a cardiologist who works at Tuen Mun hospital in northwest Hong Kong, said at a gathering there that drew several hundred of his colleagues.
The disruptions at the airport have left some travelers frustrated and angry.
Maisa Sodebayashi, who is from Brazil and works in a car factory in Japan, said on Tuesday that while she understood the protesters were fighting for democracy, she also wanted to catch her flight to Rio de Janeiro. She had been stranded in the airport for about 24 hours.
“Honestly, I don’t know what to do,” Ms. Sodebayashi said, standing beside a customer service desk.
On Tuesday afternoon, thousands of demonstrators had occupied parts of the departure and arrival halls, with some using luggage trolleys to block travelers from reaching their gates. The Hong Kong Airport Authority later closed check-in services and advised all passengers to leave as soon as possible.
By early evening, some arriving flights were still scheduled, along with some departures, apparently for passengers who had managed to clear immigration before check-in closed. But Cathay Pacific Airways, the flagship carrier, told its customers to postpone “nonessential travel” out of the city for the rest of the day and on Wednesday.
The clashes at the airport began late in the evening when police vans arrived outside the departure hall, which was full of black-clad protesters. Some of the protesters obstructed the vans with makeshift blockades and threw plastic bottles at them.
As midnight neared, bands of protesters were still in the airport, while bewildered travelers, fresh off arriving flights, walked past them and into the sweltering night. The protest crowd later thinned, as did the police presence. By late Wednesday morning, there were just a few dozen protesters in the arrivals hall.
The police  issued just before dawn that they had arrested five people on charges of unlawful assembly, breach of peace, assault against police officers and possession of “offensive weapons.” Two police officers had been injured, it said.
Much of the evening chaos at the airport centered on confrontations between protesters and the man accused of being a mainland Chinese police officer. The protesters pushed him to the ground, punching and kicking him, and he eventually fainted, prompting the ambulance evacuation. His identity could not be immediately confirmed.
Protesters also surrounded another man, bound his hands and feet, searched his belongings and punched him. Some accused him of being a “fake” reporter. He, too, was evacuated in an ambulance.
Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid on the Chinese mainland,  that the man, Fu Guohao, was one of his reporters. “This shows that they have lost their sense of reason,” Mr. Hu said of the protesters in a message to a New York Times reporter. “Hatred has muddled their minds.” He later said that Mr. Fu had not been seriously hurt.
In television footage of the incident, Mr. Fu can be heard telling his captors in Mandarin, the primary mainland Chinese dialect, that he supported the Hong Kong police.
“You can beat me up now,” he said.

The New York Times ,2019-06-24,"Hong Kong Police, Once Called _Asia_s Finest,_ Are Now a Focus of Anger",1350 ,"
HONG KONG — The 30,000-member Hong Kong police force was long known as “Asia’s finest.” Then with the world watching, they tear-gassed and beat largely peaceful demonstrators and fired rubber bullets at them. Some officers appeared to hide their badges to avoid identification.
Now the force is struggling to salvage a reputation blighted by its behavior in the June 12 protests over a proposed extradition law that convulsed Hong Kong, the semiautonomous Chinese territory.
Faced with public fury over , the police retreated and watched as thousands of young demonstrators             for 15 hours last week, barricading the exits, throwing eggs and spraying graffiti on the walls.
Officers ducked their heads as protesters aimed laser pointers at them, and a police spokeswoman who urged the demonstrators to leave was drowned out by jeering.
“Dirty cops are becoming like dogs,” read a large banner that protesters unfurled in front of the Police Headquarters on Friday. “They’re learning to be the People’s Liberation Army,” it continued, referring to the military that serves China’s governing Communist Party.
Senior government and police officials have defended the department’s performance, saying that it is apolitical and merely upholding the rule of law.
But pro-democracy opposition leaders have increasingly targeted the police force, accusing it of defending a government that in their view is subverting the same rule of law it claims to uphold. They are seeking to turn the police into a potent symbol of how the Hong Kong authorities are accountable not to the public, but Beijing.
At first, the protesters focused their ire on the contentious bill that would allow extraditions to mainland China — and their huge demonstrations forced the city’s leader to suspend the legislation indefinitely. But many protesters, particularly students and people in their 20s, have in recent days directed their anger at the police’s conduct during clashes on June 12.
That day, the police were responsible for maintaining order and securing access to government buildings during a huge rally. But when some protesters hurled bricks and tried to storm the grounds of the legislature, officers fired tear gas on crowds that had few places to flee to and used rubber bullets for the first time in decades. Dozens were injured.
 of the clashes prompted many members of the public and human rights groups to criticize the police response as excessive and the arrests as capricious. They also noted that some riot police officers did not wear badges during the episode, perhaps to evade prosecution.
Now, front-line officers routinely face verbal abuse and profanity at protests, an unusual phenomenon for members of a body that had long been highly respected. Critics of the police’s conduct have created open-source databases in which users share officers’ phone numbers and the names of their spouses and high schools on social media, with some lists referring to the police as dogs.
Lam Chi-wai, the chairman of the Junior Police Officers’ Association, a police union, said the personal data of more than 400 officers and their families had been posted online, including his own.
“This is immoral,” he said in an interview. “There are people saying that bloodshed is needed to repay bloodshed, a tooth for a tooth. I’m shocked and saddened by this.”
Public anger against the police’s tactics swelled after the police commissioner, Stephen Lo, and the city’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, described the June 12 demonstration as a riot, which suggested serious potential legal ramifications for participants.
When nearly two million Hong Kong residents, by the organizers’ count, , many also demanded that the authorities rescind the riot label.
That rally prompted Mr. Lo to backtrack on calling the protest a riot, saying that anyone who demonstrated peacefully then should not worry about prosecution on rioting charges.
But that was not enough to quell anger against the police force, and protests continued. The police have since kept the riot gear aside and tried to negotiate with protesters, even when they swarmed the Police Headquarters on Friday, posing what Commissioner Lo described in an internal memo this weekend as a “major challenge.”
Some experts say the rift is inevitable in the former British colony where the police force has substantial paramilitary training. Britain built up the Hong Kong police in the 1960s to help control pro-Communist riots, experts said.
The police force was plagued by corruption in the 1960s and ’70s, but an anticorruption drive helped improve the force’s image by the 1980s. After Britain handed the territory over to China in 1997, Hong Kong was relatively peaceful for the first decade; and even a mass protest against Beijing-backed national security legislation in 2003 went smoothly.
But cracks began to show during pro-democracy protests in the territory in 2014 known as the Umbrella Movement, analysts and police officers said in interviews. At the time, the use of force against protesters, including pepper spray and tear gas in the early days of the standoff, .
“Umbrella was a watershed,” said Gary Fong, a criminal justice expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The public “never thought the police would use tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters or students.”
Seven police officers were  for beating a protester during the 2014 demonstrations. Some observers say this month’s heavy-handed police response to protests was motivated in part by lingering grievances within the force over those convictions.
In interviews, police officers and their supporters expressed frustration that Hong Kong officials and the local news media, as they see it, underplayed the violence on the part of the protesters.
“Even when the entire society is dissatisfied with the government, the police has no choice” but to maintain order, said Mr. Lam, the police union chairman. “For this we are often seen as an key part of the government, and so we are attacked.”
They also said that by appearing to backtrack on calling the incident a riot, Mr. Lo, the police chief, essentially shifted the blame from the force as a whole to individual officers.
“What the front-line officers did was to arrest people who participated in a riot — and now you say not everyone is a rioter?” a police officer said in an interview, referring to Mr. Lo, and speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisal. “People start to blame the officers, and it hurts their morale.”
Lawrence Ho, an expert on policing and criminal justice at the Education University of Hong Kong, said he was sympathetic toward the officers who had not acted with excessive force. “They actually are scapegoats of political arguments,” he said.
Andrea Tam, an accountant who supported the police in a rally downtown on Saturday, said the riot officers had done the right thing during the clashes with protesters.
“This is a civilized society,” Ms. Tam said. “We don’t tolerate uncivilized behavior.”
Last week, the police and a watchdog that monitors complaints against them, and whose members are appointed by the chief executive, both said they would investigate the tactics used against the protesters. But many protesters and pro-democratic lawmakers have called for a fully independent inquiry.
James To, a pro-democracy lawmaker and the vice chairman of the legislature’s security panel, predicted that any prosecutions of police officers would not come for at least nine months.
For many angry protesters, he said, “that will be too late.”

The New York Times,2019-08-21,Breathing Masks and WhatsApp_ How We Cover Hong Kong 's Protests,737 ,"
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
For more than two months, antigovernment protesters have filled Hong Kong's streets. Demonstrations began as a show of opposition against a bill that would have allowed extraditions from the semiautonomous territory to mainland China; they have evolved to include broader grievances such as the use of force by the police. 
  Gillian Wong has managed both daily coverage and big-picture articles on the protest movement as assistant Asia editor, among several dozen staff in The New York Times's Hong Kong newsroom. In an interview this week, she talked about the many strands that come together to produce that reporting. This interview has been lightly edited and condensed.
  Can you describe, generally, what the day of a big protest looks like?
  In general, on a day when we're expecting a big protest, we'll have worked out ahead of time two or three different shifts of reporters. Especially early on in the movement, when these large protests were frequent, we had to assign shifts to people because we didn't want any one person to be stuck outdoors in the sun or the rain for 13 hours or longer.
  If it's a huge protest, or if there's the expectation that there will be clashes, we would probably have a live briefing going. That would involve several editors collecting reporting from the reporters and then editing one another's work, and yelling, collegially, across the newsroom as we try to figure out whether this update is ready to be published.
  We would also try to make sure that one reporter is responsible for working on an article that kind of pulls it all together into a broader story. I would work with that writer to figure out the themes that emerge from the day's developments. Then we'll start talking about investigative pieces or profiles of people and what sort of analysis we need to explain what's happening and where things are headed.
  How many people have been working on this?
  Around a dozen reporters and around a dozen editors. We have also had a lot of help from the video team in New York and the graphics team.
  I would say almost all of the editors in Hong Kong are involved in the protest coverage. It's in the city where we live -- even those who are not on protest duty, they'll send video clips of marches that are going past their neighborhoods, for instance.
  Everyone is on a WhatsApp group, sharing information on when the next protest is, where it's going to be, even down to things like, ''What are they chanting?'' It's a terrific resource for our reporting because everyone is monitoring what's going on in different ways.
  We have reporters who are closely watching the group messages where protesters are discussing their plans. And then a lot of editors are watching Twitter and sending what they see on Twitter to the reporters on the ground.
  What tools and protections do reporters in the streets have with them to be prepared for tear gas or whatever else they might encounter?
  We had to really build an inventory of equipment. We needed regular supplies of neon yellow press vests; helmets that aren't military grade -- those are too heavy and impractical -- but are still strong enough to withstand some of the rough-and-tumble that you get from being out on the streets; decent masks for dealing with tear gas; and goggles for the same purposes.
  Our reporters are really smart about keeping a distance, not getting too close and trying to minimize their exposure to tear gas, although it's not always possible. Sometimes you can't really judge where exactly the police are going to fire. I've called reporters and they'd say, ''I can't talk right now,'' as they were trying to recover from coughing.
  When things become more violent, what do you do?
  Especially in situations when there's tear gas or if the police are firing rubber bullets, I'll call the reporters on the ground and try to figure out: Are they safe? Do they know where the closest exit is, or how they can get out of the crowd quickly?
  We also try to pair people up so that they can tell us if they've lost sight of a colleague. We've been really fortunate that our team has not had any major incidents or injuries.

The New York Times,2019-10-14,Two Are Arrested After Stabbing of Hong Kong Officer During Protests,1336 ,"
The rallies were spread across much of the city and reflected continuing anger over a ban on wearing face masks at public gatherings.
A police officer was stabbed in Hong Kong on Sunday, police officials said, in what appeared to be an escalation of the street violence that has gripped the city for months, as flash-mob gatherings unfolded across town.  
  The gatherings, in more than half of the semiautonomous Chinese territory's 18 districts, were the first significant unrest since Hong Kong was convulsed by violence a week earlier over opposition to a ban on face masks at public gatherings.
  The unrest included attacks on the subway system and on businesses that protesters perceive to be supportive of Beijing. The police force said on Sunday that a protester had stabbed one of its officers in the neck, and that his condition was stable.
  The rowdy gatherings on Sunday -- coordinated via social media and encrypted messaging apps -- highlighted the continuing opposition to the unpopular ban on wearing face masks and capped a momentous week in China's relationship with the United States.
  President Trump said on Friday that the two countries had reached an interim trade deal, offering a temporary détente in a rancorous dispute that has rattled investors, lawmakers and businesses.
  Relations between China and the United States were further strained last weekend when a Houston Rockets executive's post on Twitter supporting Hong Kong's protest movement infuriated people on the Chinese mainland. Beijing initially fanned nationalistic outrage, but later moved to tamp down public anger at the N.B.A. amid concerns that it was damaging the country's international reputation.
  The demonstrations in Hong Kong on Sunday were varied, including smaller gatherings across the city, and also cases of vandalism and arson that targeted government offices, subway stations, and several banks and shops. 
  Some protesters blocked roads, broke streetlights, vandalized a train station and spray-painted antigovernment graffiti inside shopping malls.
  The Hong Kong police said one of its officers had been slashed in the neck by a protester on Sunday evening with a ''sharp-edged'' object, and that two people were immediately arrested at the scene. Video of the incident circulating widely on social media appeared to show that the attack was unprovoked. 
  The police said the officer was conscious when he arrived at a hospital. 
  The South China Morning Post newspaper also reported that a man who protesters suspected being an undercover officer was attacked on Sunday in the Tseung Kwan O district, before other officers dispersed them.
  China has increasingly depicted the protest movement in Hong Kong as being separatist in nature even though the demonstrators' demands do not include a call for independence.
  China's top leader, Xi Jinping, in a meeting with the Nepalese prime minister on Sunday, delivered a stark warning against separatism that was likely targeted at advocates of Tibetan independence but could also be read as a signal to Hong Kong.
  ''Anyone attempting to split any part of China will only be ruined; any external force supporting the separation of China will only be regarded as a delusion by the Chinese people!'' Mr. Xi was quoted as saying in a report by the official Xinhua News Agency.
  Sunday's unrest began suddenly in the afternoon, after a morning of relative calm in the city, and had been promoted on social media under the slogan ''blossom everywhere.''
  ''The more widespread today's operation is, the more difficult it is for the police to chase us down,'' Andy Wong, a 19-year-old university student majoring in Chinese literature, said on the fringes of a flash-mob gathering in the Sha Tin district.
  The police fired tear gas and made several arrests, and the city's beleaguered subway operator closed more than two dozen stations. The entire train network had already been scheduled to close earlier than usual on Sunday night.
  Some protesters  said they were demonstrating this weekend to express continued opposition to the face-mask ban, which took effect last weekend and which makes covering one's face at a public demonstration punishable by up to a year in prison. The city's embattled leader, Carrie Lam, drew on rare emergency powers to invoke the ban this month, prompting a wave of violent protests across the city.
  Other protesters said that they were disappointed in President Trump for telling reporters at the White House on Friday that Hong Kong's protest movement had ''toned down a lot from the initial days of a number of months ago'' and would eventually ''take care of itself.''
  ''He only thinks about his interests, and he's only seizing on Hong Kong to bargain with China,'' Fanny Fung, a retiree who joined a demonstration in the Wan Chai district of Hong Kong on Saturday, said of Mr. Trump.
  The protest movement began in June in opposition to contentious legislation, since shelved, that would have allowed extraditions from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland, where the courts are controlled by the Communist Party. It has since expanded to include a wide range of demands for police accountability and greater democracy.
  Many protesters in the movement have consistently appealed to the United States government for support. Notably, thousands marched to the United States Consulate in central Hong Kong last month to drum up support for a bill about the city that is moving through the American Congress.
  The draft legislation would penalize officials in mainland China and Hong Kong who suppress freedoms in the city, and require an annual justification for why the United States should offer Hong Kong special trade and business privileges. It is scheduled to be considered on the House floor this week.
  One of the bill's vocal supporters in Congress, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, traveled to Hong Kong this weekend and met with people in the protest movement. Mr. Cruz was scheduled to meet with Mrs. Lam, but he said on Saturday that she had scrapped the meeting after he refused her request to keep their conversation confidential -- a claim that her office later denied.
  The Hong Kong office of China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday night that Mr. Cruz had ''lied through his teeth'' and ''made indiscreet remarks on Hong Kong affairs.''
  Some of Sunday's gatherings turned into tense standoffs between protesters and police officers. At one of them, a police officer briefly pointed a gun at protesters who were trying to block a main road into Sha Tin.
  In a video circulating widely on Sunday afternoon, a masked protester is seen taking a flying leap to kick a riot officer, who was apparently trying to arrest another protester near a shopping center in the working-class Mong Kok neighborhood.
  Protesters also vandalized a range of targets across the city on Sunday, including a Bank of China branch, offices of pro-Beijing political parties and at least two Starbucks.
  Starbucks became a target for protesters when Annie Wu, the daughter of the founder of Maxim's Group, a conglomerate that licenses the coffee chain in the city, called protesters ''radical'' in a September speech at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.
  On Sunday, protesters broke into a shuttered Starbucks at a mall in the Tai Koo district and spray-painted ''black heart'' on its wooden countertop -- a play on ''beautiful heart,'' a direct translation of the Maxim's name in Chinese. Spokespeople for Starbucks and Maxim's Group did not immediately return requests for comment.
  Ben Chan, 47, who lives near the mall, said the vandalism didn't bother or surprise him, and that he supported the young protesters behind it.
  ''Lots of people here support democracy,'' he said. ''The kids are well educated, and they fight for what they want.''

The New York Times,2019-10-04,Hong Kong Leader Invokes Emergency Powers to Ban Masks During Protests,821 ,"
HONG KONG -- As the government tries to quell increasingly violent protests, Hong Kong's embattled leader on Friday invoked emergency powers to ban face masks, deploying a rarely used law that could inflame tensions and tar the city's reputation as an open hub for finance and tourism.
The move by the city's chief executive, Carrie Lam, which was confirmed by two people familiar with the decision, reflects the growing intensity of the monthslong movement and the pressure the government faces from Beijing to take action. 
  Tens of thousands of people joined antigovernment protests on Oct. 1, China's National Day, despite a police ban on demonstrations. In several districts across the territory, those protests quickly turned into violent clashes with the police, and included the shooting of an 18-year-old student demonstrator by an officer.
  Face masks have become a common feature of the protests, both for security and safety. Many protesters wear gas masks and respirators, as do first aid responders and journalists, to protect themselves from tear gas. Some wear them to protect their identity.
  The ban on face masks will take effect at midnight Friday. It is unclear whether the ban will apply to all protests or just illegal gatherings.
  Demonstrations are planned on Friday night at shopping malls in all 18 of Hong Kong's administrative districts, with demonstrators planning to sing ''Glory to Hong Kong,'' a new song that has become the informal anthem of the protest movement.
  Ronny Tong, a member of the Executive Council, the top advisory body to the chief executive, said on Thursday that he had been wary of any move to invoke the emergency regulations because he feared it would bring a stigma to Hong Kong internationally. But he said he would ''reluctantly endorse'' a face mask ban as an alternative to a general curfew, an idea recently suggested by some pro-Beijing hard-liners.
  Jasper Tsang, the founder of the biggest pro-Beijing political party and the president of the legislature until 2016, said that there had been deep divisions at the highest levels of the Hong Kong government for many weeks on whether to go ahead with the ban.
  ''The government has been weighing the pros and cons, and those who are against it argue it wouldn't help much,'' he said, while adding that advocates for the idea saw it as a possible way to curb violence.
  Opponents of a face mask ban made two arguments, Mr. Tsang said. One was that it could be hard to enforce. France has such a ban, but it has not prevented many so-called yellow vest protesters from wearing them anyway.
  Imposing a face mask ban could also hurt the government's effort to persuade Hong Kong's public, its tourists and the international business community that most of the city is safe most of the time, he said.
  But while the government was deeply split on the issue through Tuesday, the escalation of violence on Tuesday night, including the first police shooting of a protester, left the authorities reconsidering every option, Mr. Tsang said.
  ''It appears we need more effective, more stringent measures,'' he said.
  As word of the possible ban spread on Thursday, masked student protesters said in interviews on Thursday afternoon that they would defy the ban.
  They warned that a ban on masks could prompt more people to take to the streets and lead to more violence. Moderate protesters, who have tended to play a stabilizing role in crowds and tried to discourage attacks on individuals and businesses perceived as loyal to Beijing, might become less willing in the coming weeks to defy a ban on face masks, leaving the streets to more radical protesters, they said.
  Mrs. Lam's use of emergency powers allowed her to bypass the legislature, and underlines how her government and the police force may have run out of ways to restore order without limiting some civic freedoms. The measure alarmed some observers who feared she might exercise other emergency powers such as imposing curfews, muzzling the press, deporting foreigners and suspending various democratic rights.
  ''For the international community, any kind of emergency powers will send warning bells,'' said Simon Young, a professor at the University of Hong Kong Law School. ''Although it may start out with an incremental measure, then nothing's to stop another measure from being added, and further measures from being added.''
  For the protesters, the masks carry symbolic and practical significance. Many have become fearful they could be identified through photos and surveillance equipment then targeted for retaliation. Few people attend mass gatherings without one, even during peaceful marches and demonstrations. When Mrs. Lam held her first town hall with residents last week, many members of the audience who confronted her with difficult questions wore masks, showing their fear of retaliation.

The New York Times ,2019-10-01,"Hong Kong Police Shoot a Protester, 18, With a Live Bullet for the First Time",778 ,"
HONG KONG — A Hong Kong police officer on Tuesday shot a teenage demonstrator, the first time in months of protests that a live round was fired at a protester. The shooting capped an evening of violent protests, escalating the territory’s political crisis on the same day that the central government staged a huge military parade in Beijing to celebrate 70 years of Communist control.
The protesters in Hong Kong hoped to  by holding their own unauthorized marches. Violence quickly broke out, as demonstrators in districts across the city engaged in some of the bloodiest and most sustained clashes since protesters began taking to the streets in early June.
The split screen — pageantry in Beijing versus violence, tear gas and street fires in a restive Chinese territory — was hardly the image that China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, had hoped to show the world.
The protester was shot in the Tsuen Wan district of northern Hong Kong. Tsuen Wan is a working-class area near Hong Kong’s border with the Chinese mainland, miles from the city’s gleaming financial district.
Yolanda Yu, a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong Police Force, said in a video posted on the force’s Facebook page that the protester was an 18-year-old who had been shot in the left shoulder. She said the protester was conscious as he was taken to the hospital.
Local news media reported that the young man was a high school student.
Ms. Yu said the officer who shot the protester had been under attack by violent “rioters” who were threatening officers’ lives. “In order to save himself and his colleagues, he fired one shot at the attacker,” she said.
The Hong Kong police commissioner, Stephen Lo, told reporters at a late-night news conference that doctors were treating the young man who had been shot. He said the protester had been arrested and that the authorities would decide later whether to press charges of assaulting a police officer.
Mr. Lo said the officer who shot the protester on Tuesday acted in a “legal and reasonable” manner by giving a verbal warning before he opened fire. The officer had been assaulted at close quarters, Mr. Lo said, and had no other choice but to fire a live bullet.
“The range was not determined by the police officer, but by the perpetrator,” he said.
The police force also  that there had been “rioting acts” on Tuesday across Kowloon, Hong Kong Island and the New Territories — the three main areas of the city.
Hong Kong’s Hospital Authority later said that 51 people had been sent to the hospital by early Tuesday evening, two of them in critical condition.
In a video circulating online, an officer is seen firing a handgun at close range at a protester wearing a black T-shirt and a pink gas mask.
In the video, the protester who was shot is first seen joining a black-clad mob of people who chase a riot officer and tackle him to the ground. They kick him and beat him with what appear to be metal pipes.
At one point, the protester approaches a second police officer who is standing nearby with a handgun drawn. Just after the protester hits the officer with the pipe, the officer fires at the man at point-blank range.
A few seconds later, a gasoline bomb thrown from offscreen — presumably by a protester — lands at the feet of the officer who fired the shot. In another video, the protester who was shot is seen being treated by paramedics.
The video of the shooting was filmed by a reporter from Campus TV, a student-run television station at the University of Hong Kong, and provided to The New York Times by another reporter at the station.
The Hong Kong police have fired hundreds of rounds of tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds to disperse street demonstrations since the protests began in June. On a few occasions, officers have fired live rounds into the air as warning shots, typically when they were surrounded by violent protesters.
Tuesday’s shooting was almost certain to who have accused the police of employing overly aggressive tactics in the streets. Calls for an independent inquiry into the police’s behavior are among the key demands that protesters have issued to the Hong Kong government.
Natalie Chan, a university student who was protesting on Tuesday night in the Tuen Mun district, not far from Tsuen Wan, said that the Hong Kong police were “hurting innocent people.”
“We can’t let them continue,” Ms. Chan said of the police, as other protesters bashed traffic lights and the windows of shops and restaurants.

HONG KONG -- Crowds of masked prodemocracy demonstrators in Hong Kong defied official warnings, set fires in the streets and battled the police on Saturday in the most intense clashes since protests over the city's fate began in June.
As government helicopters hovered above, the riot police fired tear gas, pepper spray and water cannons at protesters outside government offices and the Chinese military's local headquarters. Some in the crowd threw firebombs at police barricades. 
  The police pumped blue-dyed water into knots of protesters, starkly marking them to make it easier for officers to make arrests. And by nightfall, a makeshift barricade that protesters had erected across a road had been set on fire, sending a plume of black smoke through canyons of skyscrapers and blinking neon signs.
  [City on edge: Photographs from Hong Kong's summer of protest]
  Tensions had been running high, partly because the protests marked the fifth anniversary of the day the Chinese government  rejected proposals for fully democratic elections in favor of a more limited voting plan in this semiautonomous former British colony. That decision angered many in Hong Kong, and it set off months of large-scale protests in 2014 known as the Umbrella Movement.
  The Hong Kong government said Saturday it would not reopen negotiations on proposals to increase democracy despite demands for a ''one person, one vote'' system to elect the city's leader and legislature directly without interference from Beijing.
  ''Rashly embarking on political reform again will further polarize society, which is an irresponsible act,'' the government said. ''Any discussions on constitutional development have to be premised on the legal basis, and be conducted under a peaceful atmosphere with mutual trust in a pragmatic manner.''
  Top Chinese officials, along with the Hong Kong officials who answer to them, have ruled out concessions to the demonstrators and have pushed a campaign of stepped-up arrests, according to veteran members of the city's political establishment. Beijing also does not want anything to mar its Oct. 1 celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
  The eruptions of fire and water on Saturday were a further sign of deepening frustration and determination on both sides of Hong Kong's worst political crisis since the territory returned to Chinese control in 1997.
  Jess Chan, 23, a kindergarten teacher who was handing out jackets near the site where protesters were clashing with the police in the pouring rain on Saturday, said there was desperation in the air because of the coming Oct. 1 anniversary and the fact that many protesters were students who would soon return to class.
  ''This is the last war,'' she said.
  The authorities, for their part, have signaled that no more defiance will be tolerated. Hong Kong's government released a statement early Sunday strongly condemning ''the radical protesters'' who it said had set fires, vandalized property, ''hurled numerous petrol bombs'' at official buildings and ''attacked police officers with corrosive liquid and bricks.''
  On Friday, several of the most prominent pro-democracy lawmakers and activists in the city were rounded up by the police, though many were later released on bail.
  Around midday on Saturday, tens of thousands of black-clad protesters began gathering, peacefully at first, in central areas of the city despite the government's decision to prohibit a demonstration. They marched toward government offices and the home of Carrie Lam, the territory's besieged chief executive.
  ''You are in breach of the law,'' read a black-and-yellow sign that a police officer held aloft at a playground area early on. ''You may be prosecuted.''
  [Beijing pledged ''one country, two systems'' when it took back Hong Kong. Many fear it is eroding freedoms.]
  By 3 p.m., throngs of marchers had snarled traffic on several major roads in the pouring rain, as riot police officers blocked streets in the central business district that led uphill toward Mrs. Lam's residence.
  As dusk approached, much of the city's downtown had been brought to a standstill, either by protesters or the makeshift barricades they had built. And in a harborside park outside government offices and the city's legislature, protesters began spraying graffiti on the water-filled barriers that the police had erected outside the buildings, and launching firebombs.
  The police responded with tear gas and the blue-dyed water, and phalanxes of officers then began clearing crowds across downtown, making arrests and in some cases shooting what appeared to be rubber bullets. The police later said ''minimum force'' had been used to disperse protesters after ''repeated and futile warnings.''
  Fire trucks eventually extinguished the giant blaze that had erupted atop the protest barricade. But with tear gas heavy in the air and police sirens wailing, many protesters began moving to other districts on Hong Kong Island and across the city's harbor to the Kowloon Peninsula. Some of them smashed security cameras, set up new barricades, threw more firebombs and vandalized train stations.
  Late Saturday, subway service was suspended across much of Hong Kong after disturbances at several stations. Local news videos showed officers from the police Special Tactical Squad charging a train at the Prince Edward station in Kowloon and using batons to hit several people who were crouching on the floor of a car. After the beating the officers sprayed them with pepper spray and then left.
  The police also confirmed on Sunday that two officers had each fired their guns once in the air as a warning on Saturday.
  Hong Kong's political crisis was set off by widespread anger over a bill that would allow criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial. The measure, which critics said could be used to target activists, has been suspended, but not withdrawn as protesters have demanded. Demonstrators' demands have since expanded to include universal suffrage and an investigation of the police.
  [How the protests in Hong Kong have evolved, with changing tactics and goals, and more violence.]
  Vincent Ho, who began protesting early on Saturday afternoon with his wife and their 10-year-old son, said that measures like the extradition bill had made him question whether he was comfortable having his son grow up in the city.
  ''Our freedom is being taken away,'' said Mr. Ho, 40, who works at a bank. ''Our system is being destroyed, and without that, it's not Hong Kong anymore.''
  In recent days, China's news media have underlined the Communist Party's warnings against the protesters by publicizing reports that units of China's militia, the People's Armed Police, have been on the move in Shenzhen, the mainland Chinese city next to Hong Kong, and training to suppress protests.
  On Saturday, several Chinese news media showed a 30-second video online that they said showed anti-riot police and People's Armed Police troops on trucks and buses near Shenzhen's frontier with Hong Kong.
  People's Daily, the main newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, also warned Saturday that Beijing would not stand on the sidelines if the Hong Kong government was overwhelmed by ''turmoil.'' It likened the protesters to arrogant ants, warning that they stood no chance of prevailing over the central leadership in Beijing.
  Street violence has come in fits and starts during this summer's protests, and life in Hong Kong has otherwise proceeded relatively normally. But there is growing fear among a wide cross-section of Hong Kong society that the violence, which has included a mob attack on protesters, could eventually lead to deaths.
  Some protesters have in recent weeks thrown bricks, firebombs and other objects at the police, who as of mid-August had fired more than 1,800 rounds of tear gas, plus rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, to disperse crowds.
  Last weekend, the police used water cannon trucks for the first time since the protests began in June, and a few officers drew pistols on protesters, some of whom were charging at them with sticks. And on Friday night, the Hong Kong news media reported, an off-duty police officer was stabbed during an attack by three masked men in a train station. He remained conscious but suffered bone-deep wounds.
  Mrs. Lam, the territory's chief executive, said on Tuesday that the government was looking into ''all laws in Hong Kong -- if they can provide a legal means to stop violence and chaos.''
  Mrs. Lam was answering a question about whether she was considering use of Hong Kong's sweeping Emergency Regulations Ordinance, a colonial-era law that grants Hong Kong's leader broad powers to ''make any regulations whatsoever which he may consider desirable in the public interest.'' One fear is that the law could be used to justify blocking some of the messaging apps that are popular with protesters."
The New York Times,2019-08-18,"Marches in Hong Kong Lead to Standoffs, but No Clashes",869 ,"
HONG KONG -- A day of demonstrations across Hong Kong on Saturday began with a peaceful teachers' march and ended with standoffs between the police and young protesters. But after a week in which both sides were criticized for taking violence and mayhem to new levels, there were no clashes.
In the densely populated Mong Kok district, protesters gathered Saturday evening outside a police station and shined laser pointers at windows and threw eggs at the officers guarding the entrance. Officers in riot gear took over nearby streets and chased some demonstrators. But the crowds had largely dispersed by 8 p.m. 
  Some supporters of the protest movement may have been saving their energy for Sunday, when organizers are hoping for a large turnout in Victoria Park, in the Causeway Bay district. They had applied for a permit to march from the park to the Central district, essentially the same route taken in two enormous marches in June, but the police turned them down. Organizers have appealed that decision, saying that it puts people in danger because many are likely to march regardless.
  On Saturday, young protesters distributed fliers promoting the Sunday rally. Some demonstrators chanted, ''Go to Victoria Park on Aug. 18!''
  Most of the protest events on Saturday were peaceful, and reflected the breadth and variety of the movement. The wave of demonstrations began more than two months ago to oppose a now-suspended bill that would allow extraditions to mainland China. But the movement has broadened to include other demands, including universal suffrage and an investigation of the police.
  [What's going on in Hong Kong? Here's a look at how the protests have evolved.] 
  Brenda Chow, 55, a substitute teacher, was among the thousands who gathered in Central for the morning rally led by teachers. ''We are here to protect our students, to protect our children and to voice our demands,'' she said.
  In the afternoon, under bursts of rain, crowds marched with umbrellas through the residential districts of Hung Hom and To Kwa Wan, an event meant to draw attention to the influx of tour groups from mainland China. Some demonstrators see the increase in visitors from the mainland as one aspect of China's growing presence in Hong Kong, a former British colony that has been a semiautonomous territory since its return to Chinese rule in 1997.
  ''Our community has been disturbed,'' said Andy Choi, 37, an engineer who has lived in To Kwa Wan for seven years. ''Our parking lots have been remodeled as spaces for tourist buses.''
  An animal-protection group had organized a rally for Saturday evening to call on the police to stop sending police dogs to protest scenes and to stop using tear gas in residential areas where it could cause discomfort to animals nearby. But organizers said early Saturday that the event had been canceled.
  Protest activity in Hong Kong had quieted somewhat over the past few days, as if all sides were stopping to catch their breath. Street clashes became intense in several parts of the city last Sunday, with the police firing tear gas into a subway station and the authorities accusing protesters of hurling gasoline bombs.
  On Tuesday, a night of chaos unfolded at Hong Kong's international airport, where demonstrators had forced flight cancellations for two straight days. Protesters confronted a man they accused of being a mainland Chinese police officer, pushing him to the ground and kicking him until he fainted, prompting an evacuation by ambulance.
  They also surrounded a reporter for a Chinese state-run newspaper, bound his hands and feet, punched him and searched his belongings. Protesters later apologized for their behavior.
  The United Nations human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, said this past week that there was evidence that the Hong Kong police had violated international standards for the use of less-lethal weapons like tear gas. In a statement, she urged the authorities to act with restraint.
  Concerns about spiraling violence may have increased attendance at a rally Saturday afternoon meant to show support for the Hong Kong government. Tens of thousands of people gathered in a harborside park, where ''Oppose Violence, Save Hong Kong'' was displayed on a giant screen.
  ''I came here to support the police,'' said Yeung Yin-yin, a 25-year-old accountant who said the protesters ''had brought shame upon Hong Kong people.''
  Cheung Sai-faan, 69, a retired businessman, was holding a Chinese flag and wearing another on his shoulder. ''We are not opposed to peaceful protest,'' he said, ''but I do not like violence.''
  A sign of the protest movement's continued vitality came Friday evening, when a rally in Central drew thousands of people. The gathering was peaceful and largely over by 10 p.m.
  In a leafy park surrounded by skyscrapers, the crowd watched a video message from Brian Leung, a protester known for deliberately removing his mask to show his face after he and others stormed the local legislature's building in July. He has since left Hong Kong and faces possible arrest if he returns.
  ''Uncertainty surely abounds when it comes to my future,'' Mr. Leung said. ''I would still put the movement over my safety.''"
The New York Times,2019-08-30,"Life Goes On in Hong Kong , Despite the Swirls of Tear Gas",1178 ,"
HONG KONG -- Most of Hong Kong's newspapers carried the same photo on their front pages Monday: a police officer in riot gear, his eyes wide, pointing a revolver at protesters. The photo, also beamed around the world on satellite television, captured a single, electrifying moment in months of demonstrations, which have often been described as ''paralyzing'' and ''roiling'' this city of seven million people.
But other images tell another, less tantalizing version of events: that despite the protests, life is proceeding relatively normally. 
  In a video recorded by a New York Times reporter, students in a baking class barely batted an eye last weekend when black-clad protesters surrounded their classroom in a shopping mall.  In a photo that spread across social media this month, a man at a street stall nonchalantly purchased fish balls, a popular snack, as smoke from a tear-gas canister swirled around him.
  In short: This bastion of capitalism on China's southern coast is still going about its business. The ATMs are dispensing cash. The stock market is filling orders, although it has lost $300 billion in market value since June and many economists predict the territory could soon fall into recession.
  High-end restaurants are taking reservations. Street vendors are hawking their wares. And with few -- but very notable -- exceptions, the trains are running on time and the airport, the world's seventh busiest, is operational. (Protesters, however, have vowed to disrupt the airport again on Sunday.)
  Lawyers, civil servants, accountants, teachers and aviation employees have all held demonstrations in recent weeks -- an indication of broad antigovernment sentiment -- only to return to their jobs after a few hours, a sign that showing up to work is still a priority. Citywide transportation shutdowns and days-long general strikes have yet to materialize. The school year is set to start next week, right on schedule.
  ''Yes, of course people are still eating and working,'' said Jeffrey Mok, 33, an employee at a roadside fish ball shop in Kowloon. ''Those office workers who buy their breakfast here still come every morning, and they go to work just like that.''
  ''Just because Hong Kong has a huge problem now doesn't mean we have to put our lives on hold,'' he said, summing up the sentiment of many. ''We are all worried, but life goes on.''
  The worries are real. Most residents have seen nothing like this in their lifetime. The ''one country, two systems'' arrangement under which China took back the onetime British colony in 1997, promising decades of freedom and relative autonomy, has never looked so fragile.
  And yet the city goes on. So confident are the protesters that its ubiquitous 7-Elevens and McDonald's outlets will stay open, no matter the chaos, that the former is relied on as a dispensary of umbrellas (surprisingly good at repelling tear gas canisters), while vouchers to the latter are often distributed at marches to feed and hydrate weary protesters.
  For many of the hundreds of thousands of residents who have joined the protests, demonstrating is a weekend activity. Come Monday, everyone goes back to work.
  ''Our lives are actually still very normal on weekdays,'' said Karen Lau, 22, a university student. ''Just last Friday, I went to do my nails with my close friend and then we had Japanese food. It sounds funny, because the very next day we were facing tear gas and risking our lives in Kwun Tong. I think this is what's unique about our protest this time. We are all ordinary people living our ordinary little lives.''
  Hong Kongers may be willing to rock the boat, but for now, they are unwilling to capsize it. Beijing also seems unwilling to push the envelope too far, advancing a policy of stalemate rather than risk a bloody crackdown.
  Even the local government seems torn between describing the protests as a growing menace and a contained exercise. Soon after the State Department issued a warning to American travelers visiting Hong Kong, officials here said the city remained a welcoming place for visitors and had a long tradition of peaceful protests.
  ''The impact of these illegal confrontations is confined to a limited area near the procession routes, and is not widespread,'' the government said in a statement.
  Despite Beijing's claim that the protesters are attempting to foment a ''color revolution,'' similar to those that upended governments in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, there are, as of now, no signs of the political instability or breakdown in civil society that were hallmarks of those events.
  None of which is to say that the protests have been small or unsuccessful. Nor is it to say they have not taken a toll on the economy, or descended into violence.
  Shops may be open for business, but those catering to foreign tourists and mainland Chinese visitors have been particularly pinched. Luxury brands, hotels and airlines have seen, or expect to see, a decline in business. Visitors are expected to put off traveling to the city because of the protests, which the authorities have characterized as ''riots.'' Even Trevor Noah, the host of ''The Daily Show,'' cited the protests when he canceled a comedy show here this month.
  ''Recent events in Hong Kong over the past two months did not substantially impact our passenger business in July,'' Ronald Lam, a spokesman for Cathay Pacific, the territory's flagship airline, said in a statement. ''However, we anticipate a much more significant impact to our revenue in August and onwards. Traffic into Hong Kong, both business and leisure, has weakened substantially.''
  Thousands of residents have taken to the streets weekly since early June, when the first large demonstrations were held against an unpopular bill that would allow extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist Party controls the courts. Since then, the protesters' demands have expanded to include universal suffrage and an investigation into allegations of police brutality.
  Most of the protesters have been peaceful, with rally organizers applying for permits and marchers mostly sticking to routes approved by the police.
  The protesters grabbing headlines of late have not been the hundreds of thousands of peaceful demonstrators, but a subset of several hundred who are willing to block roads, destroy property and fight the police.
  In a single day this month, the police used more than 800 cans of tear gas against protesters. In July, demonstrators stormed the local legislature, breaking windows and marring the walls with graffiti. Protesters have accused the police of using excessive force and letting thugs assault demonstrators with impunity. The police say they have shown immense restraint against the protesters, some of whom have attacked them with makeshift weapons.
  The officer in Monday's front-page photo, for instance, was pointing his gun at protesters with sticks who were charging at him and his fellow officers. He didn't shoot anyone. But someone fired a warning shot.

The New York Times ,2019-09-07,Hong Kong Protesters Return to Streets After Leader Announces Concessions,1002 ,"
HONG KONG — Pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong clashed with the police for a second straight day on Saturday, despite a concession on Wednesday from the city’s embattled leader.
The c were the first notable display of unrest since Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s top leader,             that she would withdraw a deeply unpopular extradition bill that ignited the protests in early June.
Protesters said on Saturday that they would hang up the tools of their trade — hard hats, umbrellas and gas masks — only if Mrs. Lam’s government agreed to meet all of their demands.
Those demands have grown in recent months to encompass calls for fundamental political reforms, as well as several concerns related to the protests themselves. Demonstrators are calling for an independent inquiry into what they say is police brutality, for the retraction of the government’s label of some protesters as “rioters” and for amnesty for the hundreds of them who have been arrested this summer.
People in Hong Kong are worried that Beijing is gradually eroding the high degree of autonomy that the former British colony was promised when it was handed back to China in 1997.
“Of course we want this to end as soon as possible, but when the government doesn’t respond to us they are only going to drag this out,” said Katy Cheung, an accountant who was demonstrating in Mong Kok, a working-class neighborhood in Hong Kong, on Saturday night.
“The government and police have to do something to show us that they are actually sincere, and not just say we should stop because they have withdrawn the bill,” Ms. Cheung, 26, added.
Mrs. Lam has so far declined to engage the protesters on most of their other demands. She said on Wednesday that she would add two members to an existing police review board, but that was far short of calls for an independent investigation.
A primary locus of this weekend’s demonstrations has been Prince Edward Station in Mong Kok, where riot officers , beating four people with batons and dousing them in pepper spray.
Protesters have been demanding to see security footage of that incident, but the authorities have so far refused to release any. When the authorities stopped train service to Prince Edward Station on Friday, some protesters broke into the station and vandalized it, along with the Mong Kok and Yau Ma Tei stations.
Saturday’s unrest began in the afternoon with sit-ins at several malls, and ended that night with the police deploying pepper spray against demonstrators in and around Mong Kok.
The protesters had initially planned to target Hong Kong’s international airport, a symbol of the city’s position as a global finance hub and the site of a key flash point in this summer’s unrest. Last month, the airport saw  on two men from mainland China and hundreds of canceled flights.
Last weekend, the protesters staged a “stress test” in  by gathering outside near its entrances and using cars to block traffic.
But with tight security around the airport on Saturday, some protesters went instead to nearby Tung Chung Station, chanting, “Mafia!” and “Murderers!” at riot police officers who had gathered there.
Others descended on a handful of malls, where they held sit-ins, sang local pop songs and chanted pro-democracy slogans.
“If we don’t come out for one or two weeks, the movement may die down, and we can’t let that happen,” said Andy Li, 22, a college student who joined a sit-in at a mall in the Sha Tin neighborhood of northern Hong Kong.
Mr. Li said the summer-long protest movement was fueled not only by opposition to the contentious extradition bill but also by a general lack of democratic representation in the city’s political system.
Hong Kong is a former British colony that was returned to Chinese control in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” agreement that promised it a high degree of autonomy for the next half century. But its legislature is only partially elected by popular vote, and its chief executive is essentially handpicked by Beijing and its local allies.
By early evening on Saturday, the protests had mostly shifted to Mong Kok, where the police sprayed pepper spray on protesters — though not tear gas, as they often do.
The police force later said in a statement that protesters had blocked roads, set fires and attacked the Mong Kok police station, “posing a threat to the safety of police officers and members of the public.” The statement also warned the public against taking part in what it called “vandalistic and obstructive acts.”
Local television footage late Saturday also showed the police deploying pepper spray and making arrests in Sha Tin, and a group of police officers surrounding what appeared to be a young protester in the Tai Po district and beating him with batons as he covered his head with both hands.
Another photo of the protester showed him lying on the ground bleeding profusely from his head, as a riot police officer knelt over him. It was unclear as of early Sunday morning what his medical status was or what had led to the episode captured on video.
Some protesters plan to march on Sunday toward the United States Consulate in downtown Hong Kong. Their goal is to raise awareness about a draft bill that is moving through Congress that would penalize officials who suppress freedoms in the semiautonomous Chinese territory.
Some organizers have called on protesters to eschew their usual black T-shirts for the march, and to dress instead in an outfit they describe as “smart casual + black mask.”

Using aggressive nonviolence to provoke the authorities and win over the public. 
This article has been updated to reflect news developments.
HONG KONG — I am one of the Hong Kong protesters. I took part in the two mass marches earlier this month, the June 12 protest that turned violent and the blockade of police headquarters on June 21. Today I am among the tens of thousands of protesters on the streets outside of the Legislative Council and I witnessed a group of them storm the building.
I am not optimistic that we can get what we are asking for. The government’s response has been robotic, and it still refuses to completely withdraw, instead of just suspending, the extradition bill we oppose. But like other protesters, I will devote myself to the movement anyway. It would be cowardly not to; Hong Kong’s entire future is at stake right now.
Under the proposed law, anyone in Hong Kong who is wanted by the authorities on mainland China could be sent there for trial. If the extradition bill is passed, the Chinese Communist Party will start targeting and purging its perceived opponents here, one by one, group after group. If the bill is passed, it will be as though 2047 — the year that China is supposed to gain full control over Hong Kong — were already here.
Back in 2014, when I was 25, I participated in the Umbrella Movement and joined the call for real universal suffrage in Hong Kong. I would spend most nights at the sit-ins, after work. But when the protesters were removed after 79 days of peaceful occupation, with no concession from the government, I experienced an overwhelming feeling of powerlessness.
By the time the current movement started, I, like many other young people, had been inspired by Edward Leung Tin-kei, a spokesman for Hong Kong Indigenous, a localist group that calls for the independence of Hong Kong — or that used to call for independence, before doing so publicly triggered reprisals from the government. In August 2016, after being barred from running for the Legislative Council because of his political views, , “When dictatorship is a fact, what else can we do? Revolution is our duty.” 
That made me wonder what measures — more radical than those of the Umbrella Movement — might be effective.
Then the confrontation between the protesters and the police happened on June 12, and it sharpened my thinking. 
The police’s violent overreaction revealed two things very clearly. The first one I knew, of course: The protesters’ power and equipment are no match for that of the police. At the same time, the police’s brutality helped bring out nearly two million Hong Kongers to the streets the following Sunday. That number, a record, surprised me. That’s about the size of the People’s Liberation Army of China or the population of Slovenia. When Israel became a country in 1948, it had .
An important idea that has been circulating in online forums is now firmly planted in my mind. It is called the Marginal Violence Theory (), and it holds that protesters should not actively use or advocate violence, but instead use the most aggressive nonviolent actions possible to push the police and the government to their limits.
This is what some protesters have been doing today, July 1, on the anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong to China from Britain in 1997. After a ceremony marking the anniversary, a group of protesters have stormed the Legislative Council’s building. Though they have damaged property, they are not seeking to harm anyone.
Such actions are a way to make noise and gain attention. And if they prompt the police to respond with unnecessary force, as happened on June 12, then the public will feel disapproval and disgust for the authorities. The protesters should thoughtfully escalate nonviolence, maybe even resort to mild force, to push the government to the edge. That was the goal of many people who surrounded and barricaded police headquarters for hours on June 21.
It is tricky to implement the Marginal Violence Theory. It’s difficult to calibrate it just right: If the police get violent, we, the protesters, win over a million people — as happened between the marches on June 9 and June 16 — but if the protesters get violent, we lose a million. And some protesters remain committed to using nothing but absolutely peaceful means.
That’s why I am not in favor of, for example, throwing bricks at police officers. And on the night of the 21st, I didn’t want anyone to try to break into the police’s headquarters.
I didn’t throw any eggs or tomatoes either. But I had nothing against the fact that other protesters did. That wasn’t violence; it was a symbol and a provocation, a test.
One difficulty we face is that the authorities have wised up, it seems, since June 12, and now understand our approach. At police headquarters on June 21, a journalist next to me wondered out loud why half a dozen officers had been posted at the top of an escalator outside the building, in front of, rather than behind, a metal curtain, leaving them exposed to the humiliation of being pelted by eggs and tomatoes. I think that was deliberate: The police wanted the media to relay to the public images of a force that was not only restrained, but also looked vulnerable, even under attack. The authorities, too, are playing to public opinion.
During protests earlier today, police responded with pepper spray and, in some cases, by beating protesters with batons. But later in the day, they even retreated. They might believe that images of protesters breaking glass will play to the government’s advantage.
That’s one reason that we, the protesters, should be careful not to make certain demands at this moment. Asking for self-determination or Hong Kong’s full independence from China are controversial ideas. They could turn off members of the public, or the government could find a way to use them to discredit us.
Like many of us, I decided to come out to protest not because of any politician’s or organizer’s calls, but because of various posts on the local online forum .
I distrust the older generation of pro-democracy politicians — those champagne Socialists who use fancy words to get votes, but whose actions over the years haven’t help Hong Kong make progress toward democracy. They have only created false hope.
The younger politicians I support have been disqualified from the Legislative Council or sentenced to prison for previous protest activities. It’s by necessity that the movement has no leaders.
But that’s also a good thing, I think. That we have no leaders reflects a certain vision of democracy: Everyone can express their ideas and act on them swiftly. We have traded the prolonged, organized mass sit-ins of the Umbrella Movement for spontaneous actions and momentary disruptions. The siege of police headquarters on June 21 lasted less than a day. Unpredictability makes us less vulnerable to repression. Bruce Lee’s advice, “,” has become a motto of the movement.
But being water doesn’t simply mean being fluid and elusive. To be effective, we must also be everywhere. Sometimes very large numbers of us will march all together. But even when it’s just a few of us acting, it should be with the support of many.

HONG KONG — Thousands of black-clad antigovernment protesters demonstrated at Hong Kong’s international airport on Friday, taking aim at both a global transit hub and the city’s closely guarded reputation for order and efficiency.
The protest in the airport’s arrivals hall, which is planned to last through Sunday, came as Hong Kong reeled from its worst political crisis since Britain handed the former colony back to China in 1997, and less than a week after protests and a general strike  and led to 148 arrests.
The  began in the early afternoon, as demonstrators in black T-shirts and face masks nearly filled the cavernous arrivals hall, chanting “Hong Kongers, keep going,” a rallying cry for the two-month-old protest movement.
“You’ve arrived in a broken, torn-apart city, not the one you have once pictured,” read a pamphlet that protesters offered to arriving travelers. “Yet for this Hong Kong, we fight. We shall never surrender.”
As of Friday night, the demonstration remained peaceful, and there had been no reports of arrests or disruptions of flights. Protesters were careful to leave a path clear for travelers, some of whom recorded the demonstration on their phones or helped themselves to pamphlets.
The protests in Hong Kong began two months ago, in opposition to a bill — now suspended — that would allow extraditions to mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party. It has since expanded to include a number of other demands for greater democracy.
In recent days, mainland Chinese officials have  about the risks of continuing their campaign. On Friday night, the Chinese government struck at Hong Kong’s flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific, some of whose employees were reported to have supported the protests.
China’s civil aviation authority demanded that the airline bar staffers who have supported illegal assemblies or acts of violence from working on flights to mainland China. A Cathay pilot was reported to have been among dozens of people charged with rioting in connection with a recent protest, and more than 1,500 of its employees called in sick as part of the general strike on Monday, according to a union representative.
The airline in an internal system also changed the designation of employees holding Hong Kong passports from “Hong Kong SAR” to “China SAR,” according to three employees who checked the system and screenshots of the system provided by one of them. (“SAR” stands for special administrative region.)
The system tracks travel visas for the crew, according to the employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the issue. The sudden change, seeming to emphasize that Hong Kong is part of China, alarmed some airline employees.
Cathay Pacific said it had received the directive from the aviation authority and was “studying it very carefully.”
[.]
Many of the street protests in recent weeks have ended with the Hong Kong police firing tear gas and rubber bullets in clashes with demonstrators. A hard-core contingent of young protesters has increasingly embraced violent tactics, arguing that the government has ignored more peaceful displays.
Protesters said they did not expect the police to use tear gas against them at the airport. As of early evening, the police presence in the arrivals hall was light.
Sam Yang, 45, a Taiwanese businessman, waded through the crowd after arriving on a flight from the mainland Chinese city of Chengdu. He said that his first order of business would be changing out of the black T-shirt that he happened to be wearing.
“Obviously I’ve never run into any protests here before,” Mr. Yang said. “I don’t know how this conflict will end, either. Good luck to Hong Kong.”
Before the demonstration, several protesters, including employees of Cathay Pacific, stressed that it was meant to be an entirely nonviolent way of maintaining the movement’s momentum.
Miki Ip, a real-estate agent who attended the demonstration, said she came partly to refute  that the civil disobedience had been led by foreign forces who wanted to undermine Beijing’s authority.
“China has told us so many lies, and we lack a government that really works in our interests,” Ms. Ip, 38, said in the arrivals hall. “The living conditions facing youngsters nowadays are harsh, and they feel a lack of ownership over their hometown, both economically and politically.”
This week, news media controlled by the Chinese Communist Party  in Hong Kong, Julie Eadeh, of being behind the protests. A State Department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, suggested that China had leaked personal information about Ms. Eadeh, calling that the act of a “thuggish regime.”
On Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s office in Hong Kong responded by accusing the United States of “venomous and unfounded allegations” and “gangster logic.”
The stakes are high for the airport protesters, in part because they have not applied for permission to hold the demonstration. That technically makes it an illegal assembly.
The Hong Kong airport  last year, making it the world’s eighth busiest for passengers, according to Airports Council International. It was also the world’s busiest aviation terminal for cargo.
Several other antigovernment demonstrations are planned for this weekend around Hong Kong. They include a family-friendly rally in the central business district that the police approved in advance, and three planned marches elsewhere for which permit applications were rejected.
On Wednesday, the United States joined several other countries — including , Britain, Ireland, Japan and Singapore — in issuing             to its citizens about traveling to Hong Kong. It advised them to “exercise increased caution” because of recent “confrontational” protests.
The local government scrambled on Thursday to reassure visitors that Hong Kong was still safe, saying in a statement that while some may have been inconvenienced by the recent protests, the city remained “a welcoming city for tourists and travelers from around the world.”
The Hong Kong police have in recent weeks dispersed protesters by spraying tear gas in numerous parts of the city, including residential areas and two . But the government’s statement said that “illegal confrontations” had not been widespread and had been “confined to a limited area near the procession routes,” though it acknowledged that some visitors may have been inconvenienced.
Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, appeared at a news briefing on Friday evening, flanked by her finance secretary and leaders of the local business community. They appeared to be responding to an earlier call from the Chinese government to stand behind her and oppose violence in the semiautonomous region.
In her remarks, Mrs. Lam called for all sectors of Hong Kong society to overcome their differences, emphasizing the economic harm she said the protests had inflicted on the economy. But she declined to offer new concessions to the protest movement.
“I don’t think we should just make concessions in order to silence the violent protesters,” she said.
Alison Lee, 29, one of the protesters at the airport, said Mrs. Lam’s remarks had left her cold.
“I think that Carrie Lam is just repeating what she said before,” Ms. Lee said. “She has provided no solutions and no plans to solve the current problems. This is not going to just go away because she wants it to.”

The New York Times,2019-09-04,Hong Kong Just Wants a Promise Kept,792 ,"
Hong Kong's hot summer of street protests has entered its 13th week, the demonstrations' intensity only increasing with hundreds of arrests, clouds of tear gas and volleys of rubber bullets. With every passing week, what began as a popular protest against a proposed extradition law has hardened into a struggle for the soul of Hong Kong, dimming the potential for a negotiated resolution.
Hong Kong authorities had hoped that the start of the school year would take some of the energy out of the protests, but memories of the Umbrella Movement of 2014, which petered out after 79 days without any political concessions from the government, have apparently helped keep the protesters in the streets. 
  Hong Kong's embattled chief executive, Carrie Lam, confided in private that she'd quit if she could, but that her superiors in Beijing won't let her go, most likely for fear of being seen to cave to the protesters' demands. And even if she could negotiate with protesters, their movement is leaderless, making it unclear whom she'd talk to. Even less likely is the possibility that China will entertain one of their central demands, universal suffrage, which to the Communist rulers is tantamount to being asked to surrender Hong Kong to the West.
  China massed troops along Hong Kong's border and issued angry broadsides, insinuating a devious American plot behind the ''terrorism'' of the protesters, but clearly preferred to leave the dirty work to Hong Kong authorities and the local police. The big question hanging over the city, a semiautonomous enclave, is how much protest Beijing will stomach before taking direct action, or backing down.
  Inevitably, that raises the memory of Tiananmen. But that was 30 years ago, before China grew into an economic powerhouse with global reach, capable of sustaining a trade war with the United States and of dismissing criticism from Britain, Hong Kong's former colonial master, with a disdainful shrug: ''We urge Britain to know its place.'' Many China watchers believe that the new China has worked too hard shaping its image as a tough but responsible power to lose it by bringing Hong Kong forcefully to heel.
  Of course, China's hard-line leader, Xi Jinping, must be seething. One of the central government's most ardently held tenets is ''One China,'' which stipulates that territories ceded in weaker times remain sovereign Chinese lands that will eventually revert to full Chinese control. Hong Kong was first; the far greater prize is Taiwan. Whatever hopes Beijing may harbor of bringing Taiwan, a democracy, into its fold would become even more remote if Hong Kong's ''one country, two systems'' formula disintegrated in a Tiananmen-style crackdown.
  Focused ideologically on ''One China,'' mainland China seems incapable of understanding what the Hong Kong protesters really want. Though as a police state China no doubt has reams of information from officials, spies and informers, the rulers probably hear what they want to hear, that most Hong Kongers are content with their relative prosperity and freedom and will eventually reject rabble-rousers. So the protests must be the work of outside agitators seeking a ''color revolution'' like those that swept through Ukraine and Georgia.
  But the Hong Kong protesters are not waging a color revolution. Their goal is not some abstract ideal of democracy, but the memory of a way of life they have no intention of letting Beijing take away. They are fired not by foreign agents but by China's attempts to deny them full participation in their government, which they were promised through 2047 in the agreement under which Britain ceded control over Hong Kong.
  That's a just cause, even if the protesters have at times resorted to violence. In the past, the United States would be expected to intercede as the world's greatest champion of human rights. Alas, President Trump has so far treated the Hong Kong protests largely as a diversion from his trade war with China, at one point telling Mr. Xi that the United States would not interfere in what China did in Hong Kong. Mr. Trump has since issued a variety of conflicting tweets and remarks, of which the most supportive of the pro-democracy demonstrators was a demand that Mr. Xi ''work humanely with Hong Kong.''
  The better response, from Mr. Trump and all others who care for democracy, is to stand with the people of Hong Kong who want nothing more than a say in how they are governed.

The New York Times,2019-11-18,Riot Police Clash With Students in Standoff on Hong Kong Campus,1484 ,"
As riot police tried storming a campus occupied by activists, they were met by protesters fighting back with Molotov cocktails and bows-and-arrows.
HONG KONG -- Hundreds of Hong Kong activists armed with firebombs and bows-and-arrows on Monday battled riot police who have laid a days-long siege to a university, the most violent confrontation yet in a half-year of protests.  
  Early Monday, the police tried storming the campus at the main entrance and made some arrests. But the occupiers fought back with dozens of firebombs and set barricades ablaze, forcing the police to retreat.
  As day broke, the occupiers and the police were still locked in the standoff at Hong Kong Polytechnic University that began Saturday night, and smoke billowed from the grounds. Some protesters on Monday morning raced for the exits, only to be met with volleys of tear gas. 
  The police used tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and armored vehicles to try breach the barricades all day on Sunday. But activists resisted into the night. One police officer was hit in the leg by an arrow, while student leaders said protesters suffered eye injuries and hypothermia after being struck by the water cannon. 
  The clashes were the culmination of the most disruptive week of the monthslong protests, a period that has focused a global spotlight on the growing desperation of the pro-democracy activists and aggressive efforts by the police to suppress them. It is a sign the conflict is turning more violent as the territory prepares to hold elections later this month.
  The activists are struggling against the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing to preserve autonomy for Hong Kong, a political system guaranteed for 50 years by an agreement between Beijing and London. The British handed over the global financial hub in 1997.
  The rising tensions and the potential for greater control over Hong Kong's political and legal systems by the Communist Party have raised questions over the long-term commercial viability of Hong Kong and the integrity of its fraying social fabric.
  In Washington, American officials said they were monitoring the clashes as well as reviewing a report by The New York Times on leaked internal Communist Party documents showing how party leaders, including President Xi Jinping, had set up internment camps to hold one million or more Muslims in another frontier area, Xinjiang. 
  Trump administration officials and Congress have been holding discussions on whether to impose separate sets of sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials for human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. But President Trump has held back for fear of upsetting trade talks.
  Hong Kong is scheduled to hold district council elections next Sunday. Some residents worry the government might postpone the vote, though Carrie Lam, the chief executive of the territory, has said the elections will be held on time.
  A small number of supporters of Communist Party rule, as well as Hu Xijin,  the chief editor of Global Times, a state-run news organization in Beijing, had become so outraged by the Sunday clashes that they said the police should use live ammunition.
  The occupation of the university has forced a weeklong shutdown of a tunnel leading to the business districts on Hong Kong Island from Kowloon, and activists said they planned more traffic blockades on Monday.
  The university president, Jin-Guang Teng, said Monday morning that he had negotiated a temporary truce with the police, but suggested occupiers still would have to turn themselves in to the police after leaving the campus.
  The clashes of the past week began when protesters changed from a regular routine of weekend protests to disrupting traffic on workdays. The disruptions and attempts by the police to breach campuses -- considered a last refuge by activists -- quickly led to protesters occupying five universities, two of which sit astride key transportation routes. 
  The death of a student from a fall earlier this month and two dramatic violent acts also set the city on edge -- a traffic policeman shot an unarmed protester, and activists set a man on fire after he confronted them. 
  Protesters abandoned four of the universities over the weekend, but those at Polytechnic University held on. Hardcore activists converged there, while more moderate ones left on Sunday as the police surrounded the campus.
  The police arrested dozens trying to flee, including first-aid volunteers. Mainstream supporters of the movement drove to the campus to try to get the police to back off. On Sunday night, the police threatened to use lethal force if the protesters did not leave.
  ''I know that there is a possibility that the police will fire live bullets on us tonight, but right now, we have no choice,'' William Lau, 22, a protester on campus, said around midnight. He estimated there were about 500 activists on site at that time.
  About 50 were arrested after trying to leave, he said, so others were wary of trying to exit.
  ''The police would never just let us walk out like that,'' he said. ''I know that some want to leave now but don't know how, while a fair number want to stay and fight.''
  Right outside the campus, pro-democracy lawmakers, a top Roman Catholic official, an American pastor and a student leader called on the Hong Kong government to intervene to prevent bloodshed.
  ''I want to seek help from the government to stop the police force from their operation and avoid tragedy,'' said Owan Li, a student representative on the university council.
  As the police fired tear gas, Bishop Joseph Ha tried entering with the lawmakers and the American pastor, William Devlin of the Bronx, but were turned away by the police.
  ''If the police are to launch a clearance, they should use as minimal force as possible because lives are precious,'' Mr. Ha said. 
  Mr. Devlin said in a telephone interview that he had been on campus for about four hours as the clashes unfolded and had left, but was trying to re-enter.
  ''They were not being deterred,'' he said of the protesters. ''They were ready to be arrested. They said, 'We stand for freedom, dignity, democracy, human rights.'''
  Mr. Devlin said he had been on the front line in the late afternoon Sunday when the police used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons against protesters.
  He said he had seen protesters throw 10 to 20 firebombs to deter the police from advancing. At least two were armed with bows and arrows, he said.
  Louis Lau, the police superintendent, said before midnight that an officer had fired a live round at a vehicle charging toward officers in an area near campus.
  ''Coldblooded rioters can only imitate terror acts,'' he said. 
  Protesters confronted the police throughout the night in nearby neighborhoods to try to draw them away from the campus. The presidents of five universities released a statement calling for restraint by all sides and asking everyone on the campus to leave.
  Denise Ho, a pro-democracy pop singer who has been banned on the mainland by Beijing, invoked the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre on Twitter and said, ''World, please help Hong Kong and save our students!''
  The police tried sending an armored vehicle across a bridge on the east side of campus. Protesters set the vehicle on fire with bombs, forcing it to retreat.
  Mr. Hu, the chief editor of Global Times, posted a video of the vehicle aflame on Twitter and said, ''Police should be permitted to fire live rounds in this case to counter rioters.''
  The violence came after protesters at the university on Friday prepared for a long siege, as they poured gasoline into glass bottles to make hundreds or thousands of bombs and practiced throwing those into an empty swimming pool. They also did target practice with catapult-style slingshots and bows-and-arrows.
  The police began advancing around 10 p.m. Saturday, and the clashes reached a high pitch on Sunday afternoon.
  In nearby Kowloon Tong on Saturday, Chinese soldiers jogged out of their barracks by Hong Kong Baptist University and cleared bricks from streets that had been placed there by protesters to block traffic.
  The soldiers wore T-shirts and basketball jerseys, and carried brooms. The Hong Kong garrison of the People's Liberation Army is based in 19 sites once occupied by the British military. Even though Chinese troops have been stationed in Hong Kong since 1997, they almost never venture into the city.
  The cleanup, which was lauded by Chinese state-run news organizations, prompted a torrent of criticism from local residents. Pro-democracy lawmakers issued a statement saying that the local government and the Chinese military had ignored restrictions imposed on the troops by local laws.

The New York Times,2019-07-22,Hong Kong Protesters Skirmish With Riot Police,1271 ,"
HONG KONG -- The Hong Kong police fired rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets on Sunday to disperse protesters after some of them vandalized the Chinese government's liaison office in the city, a direct challenge to Beijing's authority after a peaceful protest earlier in the day.
In a separate clash, footage from a local television station showed, masked men, dressed in white and wielding sticks, assaulted antigovernment protesters in a train station late Sunday night in northwestern Hong Kong. 
  The unrest spiraled out of a march that called for an independent investigation into what protesters said was police brutality in earlier street clashes. The march was peaceful, but thousands of demonstrators later marched past where the police had said the official demonstration should end.
  Protesters then occupied major roads and heckled police officers stationed outside government buildings. ''Recover Hong Kong; it's the time for revolution,'' some chanted.
  By nightfall, some protesters had defaced a crest of the Chinese government at the liaison office with eggs and black ink, and had sprayed the building's exterior with graffiti.
  Shortly after 8 p.m., about 100 riot police officers, some carrying guns with plastic rounds, approached the liaison office and dragged away metal barricades that protesters had placed in the road.
  ''Charge forward!'' they shouted, as hundreds of protesters fled east through the streets.
  Scuffles soon broke out nearby, with some protesters lobbing eggs and bags of liquid at the police during a standoff outside the Central Police Station. After a group of protesters charged forward and threw projectiles, riot police officers rushed them, shooting several rounds of tear gas.
  That same evening, at the Yuen Long train station, an unknown group of masked men in white attacked protesters and civilians, said Jerming Zhang, a 16-year-old student and first-aid volunteer who was at the station.
  He said in a phone interview that as civilians, including those with children, tried to flee the station, the masked men followed them onto an open train and continued beating people with wooden sticks.
  ''It was like a stampede,'' he said. ''They hit people indiscriminately, smiling as they beat them up.''
  In a statement on Sunday night, the Hong Kong government condemned protesters who it said had ''blatantly challenged the national sovereignty by maliciously besieging and storming'' Beijing's liaison office. It promised to ''deal with these acts in a serious manner in accordance with the law.''
  A later statement denounced the attack at the train station, saying ''some people congregated at the platforms'' and attacked and injured commuters. ''This is absolutely unacceptable to Hong Kong as a society that observes the rule of law,'' the statement said.
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of China's State Council also condemned the actions of the protesters who blocked the liaison office and vandalized it, and warned of serious consequences.
  ''Such acts openly challenge the authority of the central government,'' the statement said, calling the actions ''absolutely intolerable.''
  The developments on Sunday were the latest chapter in the city's  worst political crisis since China reclaimed sovereignty from Britain in 1997. They signaled growing antagonism between the largely peaceful protest movement and the front-line officers patrolling it.
  ''I hope that the police can take reasonable actions tonight,'' Roy Kwong, a lawmaker who has been a driving force behind the protests, told reporters at the front lines early Sunday evening. ''Otherwise, I fear that the anger of the people will erupt.''
  The Civil Human Rights Front, which has helped organize the recent protests, said it estimated that 430,000 people had turned out for the officially sanctioned part of the march. A police spokeswoman said that the estimated number of people who had marched along the permitted route during the ''peak period'' was 138,000.
  The police also said that they were investigating whether explosives found Friday at a ''homemade laboratory'' were related to the Sunday protest, but that they did not have enough evidence to make any conclusion. On Friday, the police said, officers seized about two pounds of powerful explosives, 10 gasoline bombs. and bullets and knives from an industrial building.
  Three men in their 20s were arrested in connection with the case.
  Hong Kong's mass demonstrations began in early June in response to unpopular legislation that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the governing Communist Party. The bill has since been suspended but not fully withdrawn, one of the protesters' key demands.
  On Sunday afternoon, thousands of protesters dressed mostly in black T-shirts set off on a march, some carrying signs saying, ''No extradition to China'' and ''Stop police brutality.''
  ''The government must withdraw the bill and set up an independent inquiry committee to investigate the police,'' said Tommy Tsang, an 81-year-old retiree.
  He said he was particularly angered by the police violence. ''If you don't hit people, why would they hit you back?'' he said.
  Advisers to the region's embattled chief executive, Carrie Lam, say her administration did not intend to make further concessions to the protesters. That stance suggests the government is confident it can weather the protests, despite the risks of damage to the local economy or violence between demonstrators and police officers.
  Police officials say that they have largely acted with restraint and have used force only when attacked by protesters. They accused some protesters of rioting during recent demonstrations, including one in which a small group forcefully stormed the Hong Kong legislature.
  The police and a watchdog that monitors complaints against them have said they plan to investigate officers' actions at a June 12 demonstration that turned violent. Many people in Hong Kong, a city of about seven million, say they believe that the police response that day -- which included firing tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds -- was excessive.
  But the protesters and their supporters argue that the watchdog is not independent and will not conduct a fair investigation.
  At the Sunday afternoon march, the crowd spanned a diverse age range. ''Everyone is out here for their children,'' said Sam Tam, 57, who attended marches this month with his 8-year-old daughter and about 18 relatives.
  ''The older generation has to say sorry to the younger generation for not listening to their voices,'' he said.
  As the sweltering day dragged on, it was mainly those from the core demographic of the recent protests -- young people in their 20s -- who occupied major roads and swelled outside government offices.
  Brian Heung, a student at the University of Hong Kong, said he and other protesters had intentionally disobeyed the police out of a sense of desperation.
  ''We have done everything peacefully, and they don't have a proper response,'' Mr. Heung, 18, said after putting a Post-it note on a barricade outside Police Headquarters calling officers shameless. ''So we had to push the limits.''
  Thousands of protesters at the front of the crowd defied police orders and streamed west into Admiralty, the district that houses the city's legislature. Some heckled police officers, while others gathered outside the Hong Kong Police Headquarters nearby, chanting, ''Shame.''
  Demonstrations in support of the police have also been organized by pro-establishment groups, including one on Saturday."
The New York Times ,2019-08-06,China Warns Hong Kong Protesters Not to _Take Restraint for Weakness_,1017 ,"
HONG KONG — An official in Beijing on Tuesday issued China’s sternest denunciation yet of the demonstrations in Hong Kong, saying they had “exceeded the scope of free assembly” and warning that the semiautonomous city would not be allowed to descend into chaos.
“I want to warn all the criminals to not wrongly judge the situation and take restraint for weakness,” said Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Chinese government’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office. He warned against underestimating China’s “firm resolve and strength to safeguard the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.”
But Mr. Yang offered little in the way of concrete measures to resolve the political crisis, calling for more patriotic education and encouraging residents to confront protesters. “We need to stand up to protect our wonderful homeland,” he said.
The comments came a day after protesters in Hong Kong  in weeks of demonstrations, blocking trains and roads and urging workers to strike. Air travel was also snarled, with more than 200 flights canceled after 2,300 civil aviation workers stayed home, according to an estimate by union officials.
Mr. Yang denounced the tactics of protesters who have surrounded police stations, throwing bricks and lighting fires, as “extreme violence that is shocking to see.”
He said, “The central government will never allow any violent attempt to push Hong Kong into a dangerous situation.”
Protesters gathered at more than a half dozen sites across Hong Kong on Monday, and the police arrested 148 people and fired 800 canisters of tear gas. The tear gas used on Monday alone came close to the 1,000 rounds that the police had used over the previous eight weeks.
Joshua Wong, a leader of the 2014 Umbrella movement and a prominent pro-democracy activist in Hong Kong, said Mr. Yang’s comments were an attempt to scare the people of the city into silence.
“Beijing does not rule Hong Kong by law, they just rule by tear gas,” he said.
The protests this summer began over a proposal that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. The government suspended that legislation in mid-June, but the protests have continued, demanding that the government fully withdraw the bill. The protesters are also angry about other issues, including allegations of police brutality and the stalled expansion of direct elections in Hong Kong.
Protesters who have clashed with the police have argued that more confrontational methods became necessary after the government rejected demands made in earlier, peaceful marches, one of which was joined by as many as two million people.
Mr. Yang also warned protesters to not challenge China’s sovereignty, denouncing those who  and threw Chinese flags into Victoria Harbor in recent days. He criticized protesters’ use of a slogan from an imprisoned activist who once advocated Hong Kong’s independence: “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times.”
Last week, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office , and the police, but they offered little new to resolve the political crisis. It was rare for the office to hold a news conference, and even rarer for it to hold another just a week later, an indication of the Chinese leadership’s struggle to respond to the increasingly fraught conflict in Hong Kong.
Mr. Yang reiterated on Tuesday that China backed Mrs. Lam and the police, and he said there should be no leniency in prosecuting violent crimes.
“These rioters are extremely rampant and deranged,” he said. “A blow from the sword of law is waiting for them in the future.”
Hong Kong, a former British colony, was returned to China in 1997, and it operates under a model called “one country, two systems,” which allows the city to maintain its own political and legal systems and gives residents a far greater degree of civil liberties than is seen in mainland China.
The central government is responsible for Hong Kong’s national defense and foreign relations. But many in Hong Kong fear Beijing is wielding greater influence over the city, slowly eroding its freedoms.
A spokesman for China’s Ministry of National Defense  that the People’s Liberation Army could be called on to maintain order in Hong Kong. The military has a garrison of 6,000 to 10,000 soldiers in Hong Kong, but local officials have repeatedly denied rumors that they have been preparing to help quell demonstrations.
Last week, the Hong Kong garrison released a video showing its troops training to confront protesters. And images have been released of large groups of mainland police officers holding drills in preparation for the Oct. 1 celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. Those images have also fueled unsubstantiated rumors about the possible intervention of Chinese forces.
Asked if he could rule out an intervention by the Chinese military, Mr. Yang said China would “never allow a challenge to the principle of ‘one country, two systems’ to go unpunished and will never allow any turbulence that will threaten national unity.”
Mrs. Lam warned on Monday of a crisis of “security and safety” and said “a series of extremely violent acts” was “pushing Hong Kong into very precarious circumstances.”
A group of protesters met with reporters on Tuesday to challenge the government’s portrayal of them, accusing Mrs. Lam and other top officials of dodging responsibility for the crisis.

For more than two months, antigovernment protesters have filled Hong Kong’s streets. Demonstrations began as a show of opposition against a  extraditions from the semiautonomous territory to mainland China; they have evolved to include broader grievances such as the use of force by the police.
Gillian Wong has managed both daily coverage and big-picture articles on the protest movement as assistant Asia editor, among several dozen staff in The New York Times’s Hong Kong newsroom. In an interview this week, she talked about the many strands that come together to produce that reporting. This interview has been lightly edited and condensed. 
Can you describe, generally, what the day of a big protest looks like?
In general, on a day when we’re expecting a big protest, we’ll have worked out ahead of time two or three different shifts of reporters. Especially early on in the movement, when these large protests were frequent, we had to assign shifts to people because we didn’t want any one person to be stuck outdoors in the sun or the rain for 13 hours or longer.
If it’s a huge protest, or if there’s the expectation that there will be clashes, we would probably have  going. That would involve several editors collecting reporting from the reporters and then editing one another’s work, and yelling, collegially, across the newsroom as we try to figure out whether this update is ready to be published.
We would also try to make sure that one reporter is responsible for working on an article that kind of pulls it all together into a broader story. I would work with that writer to figure out the themes that emerge from the day’s developments. Then we’ll start talking about investigative pieces or profiles of people and what sort of analysis we need to explain what’s happening and where things are headed.
How many people have been working on this?
Around a dozen reporters and around a dozen editors. We have also had a lot of help from the video team in New York and the graphics team. 
I would say almost all of the editors in Hong Kong are involved in the protest coverage. It’s in the city where we live — even those who are not on protest duty, they’ll send video clips of marches that are going past their neighborhoods, for instance.
Everyone is on a WhatsApp group, sharing information on when the next protest is, where it’s going to be, even down to things like, “What are they chanting?” It’s a terrific resource for our reporting because everyone is monitoring what’s going on in different ways.
We have reporters who are closely watching the group messages where protesters are discussing their plans. And then a lot of editors are watching Twitter and sending what they see on Twitter to the reporters on the ground. 
What tools and protections do reporters in the streets have with them to be prepared for tear gas or whatever else they might encounter?
We had to really build an inventory of equipment. We needed regular supplies of neon yellow press vests; helmets that aren’t military grade — those are too heavy and impractical — but are still strong enough to withstand some of the rough-and-tumble that you get from being out on the streets; decent masks for dealing with tear gas; and goggles for the same purposes.
Our reporters are really smart about keeping a distance, not getting too close and trying to minimize their exposure to tear gas, although it’s not always possible. Sometimes you can’t really judge where exactly the police are going to fire. I’ve called reporters and they’d say, “I can’t talk right now,” as they were trying to recover from coughing.
When things become more violent, what do you do?
Especially in situations when there’s tear gas or if the police are firing rubber bullets, I’ll call the reporters on the ground and try to figure out: Are they safe? Do they know where the closest exit is, or how they can get out of the crowd quickly? 
We also try to pair people up so that they can tell us if they’ve lost sight of a colleague. We’ve been really fortunate that our team has not had any major incidents or injuries.

The New York Times ,2019-07-04,Hong Kong Police Announce First Arrest in Storming of Legislature,972 ,"
HONG KONG — The Hong Kong police have announced their first arrest in connection with Monday’s assault on the territory’s legislative building, as protesters gird themselves for the possibility of more detentions and what they fear will be a citywide dragnet.
The police said in a statement Wednesday night that they had detained a 31-year-old man on charges that included forcible entry into the building that houses the Legislative Council, as well as causing damage to the premises and attacking the police. The man was identified only by his surname, Poon.
Several hundred demonstrators broke into the legislature on Monday night after a day of protests, centered on an unpopular bill that would allow extradition to mainland China. Some of them defaced portraits, destroyed surveillance cameras and spray-painted political slogans on walls, as riot police officers looked on. Hundreds of thousands of other people in a separate demonstration.
Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory, has been roiled by protests since the city’s leaders tried last month to push the extradition bill through the legislature. The bill would make it possible for criminal suspects to be sent to the mainland, where the courts are controlled by the Communist Party, and many residents believe it would put dissidents and others in jeopardy and mark an alarming new development in the erosion of the former British colony’s civil liberties.
After enormous protests in June, which included some violent clashes with the police, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said she would suspend the bill. But demonstrators have demanded that it be fully withdrawn and that Mrs. Lam step down.
Earlier Wednesday, the police had announced , but those were connected with attempts to disrupt a flag-raising ceremony, not the attack on the legislative building.
Reporters were invited by the Hong Kong government on Wednesday to tour the ransacked building, where they saw detectives collecting boxes and bags of evidence. Billy Li, the head of the Progressive Lawyers Group, a pro-democracy association, said the police would crosscheck the evidence with their DNA and fingerprint databases. That process usually takes weeks but can be accelerated, he said.
Many of the protesters are expecting more arrests in the coming days. On messaging apps, which the largely leaderless movement has been using to coordinate its activities, tips have circulated about what to tell the police if arrested: “I have nothing to say. I demand to see a lawyer. I have the right not to unlock my phone. I need to eat, drink water, go to the bathroom, have a blanket.”
Since the clashes on Monday, questions have been raised about why the police stood by for hours as demonstrators laid siege to the walls of the building, then retreated when it became clear that they had breached the legislature’s inner chamber. Hours later, after most of the protesters had left, the police used tear gas to disperse the remaining crowd outside.
In a statement on Wednesday, the police said that a physical confrontation within the Legislative Council’s confined space could have had “unpredictable” consequences. The police have come under intense criticism for  against protesters on June 12.
While leaders in Beijing and Hong Kong have condemned the mostly young protesters who stormed the legislature on Monday as “extreme radicals,” many demonstrators who had not joined them said they condemned the vandalism but understood those protesters’ frustrations.
Jasper Tsang, a former president of the Legislative Council, joined the ranks of a small group of pro-Beijing lawmakers who have unexpectedly urged the government to give more consideration to the protesters’ demands. In a televised interview with a local broadcaster, Now News, on Wednesday night, Mr. Tsang raised the possibility that Mrs. Lam could grant amnesty to the protesters.
“The chief executive could consider that the whole event was caused by conflict on a deeper level,” Mr. Tsang said. “If the punishments of the young people could be pardoned, then that would be beneficial for the entire society.” Mr. Tsang also suggested that Hong Kong’s political system needed reform.
Some protesters have pointed to one of the slogans spray-painted in the Legislative Council as summing up their frustrations: “It was you who taught me peaceful protests don’t work.” They noted that nonviolent marches, some of them among the largest in the city’s history, have not pressured Mrs. Lam to fully withdraw the extradition bill or to step down, as they have also demanded.
On Thursday, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology student union said Mrs. Lam had reached out to propose a closed-door meeting with its members, an apparent bid to follow through on her promises to improve communications with the public. But the student union , saying that any such meeting must be open to the public.
“The union cannot represent all protesters, and those discussing with Carrie Lam’s government must include all sectors of society,” the student union said in a statement.
The Progressive Lawyers Group appealed to protesters to exercise self-restraint, saying in a  that their cause “may be undermined by any unwarranted use of force.” But the statement added that “the abuse of power by those in public office does far more damage to the rule of law than disobedience of the law.”

The New York Times ,2019-08-07,Chinese Official Warns Hong Kong Protesters Against _Color Revolution_,1369 ,"
HONG KONG — A top Chinese official overseeing Hong Kong affairs said on Wednesday that the city was experiencing its worst crisis since the former British colony returned to China in 1997, as weeks of near daily antigovernment protests continued with little sign of easing.
The “turmoil” in Hong Kong “has been going on for 60 days straight, getting bigger and bigger,” said the official, Zhang Xiaoming, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office. “The violence is getting more and more intense, impacting an increasingly wide part of the society. It can be said that Hong Kong is facing the most serious situation since its return.”
He said the demonstrations “have the clear characteristics of a color revolution,” a reference to uprisings in the former Soviet bloc that Chinese officials believe drew inspiration from the United States.
Mr. Zhang spoke at the opening of a forum in Shenzhen, a mainland city next to Hong Kong, to an audience of about 500 members of the Hong Kong establishment, including representatives to China’s congress and a national consultative body.
Weeks of demonstrations , when protesters blocked trains and roadways. Union officials estimate 350,000 people stayed home from work, including many aviation workers, leading to more than 200 canceled flights at the Hong Kong airport.
The day ended with mass protests across the city. The police fired 800 canisters of tear gas, approaching the total of 1,000 canisters fired over the previous eight weeks.
On Tuesday, a spokesman from Mr. Zhang’s office issued , saying that the protesters “are extremely rampant and deranged,” and that a “blow from the sword of law is waiting for them in the future.”
Mr. Zhang struck a more measured tone in his comments on Wednesday, describing the meetings as an opportunity to hear from the people of the city so “the central government can make decisions that are closer to Hong Kong society.” After his introduction, reporters were asked to leave and the meetings continued behind closed doors.
The event was the first such joint meeting of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, a mainland agency, and the Chinese government’s representative office in Hong Kong since the 2014 Umbrella Movement, when pro-democracy protesters occupied parts of the city for nearly three months.
Michael Tien, an establishment lawmaker, said he used the session to propose an independent investigation into the crisis and a full withdrawal of the extradition bill that set off the protests earlier this year, two key demands from protesters.
“We need to be concerned about the future generations if we do not handle this particular incident carefully,” he said. “By that I mean a high-level committee of inquiry to look at all the background of this, not just the police but also the protesters, the allegations about foreign government involvement and where the money comes from. There are many aspects to it.”
The legislation, which the government suspended in June, would allow the extradition of suspects to mainland China. Many people feared that it would expose Hong Kong residents to a judicial system controlled by the Communist Party, and that it was another step in the erosion of civil liberties in Hong Kong.
Mr. Tien was the .
Mr. Zhang told the forum Wednesday that a full withdrawal of the bill would imply that the stated intention of preventing Hong Kong from becoming a haven for fugitives was wrong. He added that an inquiry should wait until the unrest had eased.
This week Hong Kong officials have increased their public appearances after criticism that they had largely disappeared from view, leaving riot police officers on the streets as the most prominent representatives of the government.
When Carrie Lam, the Hong Kong chief executive, spoke to reporters on Monday, it was her first news conference in two weeks. She announced that the police would begin giving daily briefings. And Mrs. Lam made an .
The Civil Human Rights Front, the group that organized several protest marches, said the increasing volume of official statements was “fueling huge resentment by constantly condemning demonstrators rather than to help facilitate effective communication within the society.”
As pro-Beijing representatives met in Shenzhen on Wednesday, protests continued in Hong Kong. Thousands of lawyers marched to the offices of the Hong Kong Department of Justice to demand a meeting with the secretary of justice and the director of public prosecutions.
Dennis Kwok, a lawmaker who organized the march, said that the legal profession, which he represents in Hong Kong’s Legislative Council, was concerned that hundreds of protesters were arrested over political grounds.
“They are trying to arrest as many people as possible to scare them away from protests,” Mr. Kwok said, adding that the  were “totally disproportionate” with the protests that took place.
Lawyers at the rally said they were particularly concerned by . The government was criticized for its delayed response to the attacks, while it swiftly arrested protesters in another part of Hong Kong.
“All we want is justice. All we want is consistency,” said Kevin Yam, a lawyer. “We don’t want to watch a bunch of thugs get away with it while the best of our youths are prosecuted and their futures are being taken away.”
The event follows a silent march by lawyers in early June to call for the government to withdraw the extradition proposal.
On Tuesday, the police fired tear gas for the second consecutive night in the Sham Shui Po neighborhood. Protesters and residents complained that the  as Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker, spoke outside a police station.
Tse Chun-chung, a police spokesman, said people outside the Sham Shui Po police station hurled bricks and bottles and painted on the exterior walls. “Their acts put the officers and other citizens in danger,” he said.
Officers fired about 20 tear gas grenades and arrested nine people. Since the protests began, the police have arrested 589 people, ranging in age from 13 to 76.
Crowds had gathered in Sham Shui Po after officers arrested Keith Fong, president of the Hong Kong Baptist University student union, for possession of laser pointers considered to be “offensive weapons.”
“Since June, many protesters have used laser guns to target our officers,” said Mr. Tse. “The strength of these laser beams is stronger and stronger, and their colors are more and more diverse.”
The police also demonstrated a laser pointer during a news conference,  until it began to smoke after a few seconds.
On Wednesday night protesters responded by gathering on the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront, creating a light show of laser pointers against the backdrop of the Hong Kong Space Museum. They also attempted, unsuccessfully, to ignite a copy of a pro-Beijing newspaper with multiple laser pointers.
The mainland authorities have increasingly signaled their preparations to handle mass protests. A drill on Tuesday by 12,000 mainland police officers in Shenzhen included riot police confronting people in black clothing and yellow helmets — the unofficial uniform of protesters in Hong Kong. And last week the Hong Kong garrison of the Chinese military released a video of it training to handle mass unrest.

The New York Times ,2019-10-04,Hong Kong Banned Masks at Protests. Masked Crowds Protested the Ban,1741 ,"
Thousands protested, many wearing masks, as the clock ticked toward the ban taking effect, and clashes broke out around the city.
HONG KONG — Hong Kong’s embattled leader invoked emergency powers on Friday to ban face masks, deploying a rarely used law that triggered another wave of violent protests and threatened to erode confidence in a city that depends heavily on international business and tourism.
Scattered clusters of protesters were seen defying the mask prohibition — punishable by fines and jail time — after it took effect at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, suggesting a brewing weekend standoff between demonstrators and the authorities, who have tried for months to quell the protests.
The decision by the city’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, reflected the growing intensity of the movement and the mounting pressure the government faces to take action. 
Earlier this week, tens of thousands of protesters  designed to overshadow a politically sensitive anniversary in China. The protests quickly turned into violent clashes, including            . 
But the decision by Mrs. Lam invoking emergency powers could backfire by provoking further concern about government encroachment on the civil freedoms enjoyed in Hong Kong and Beijing’s influence over the semiautonomous region. 
In the hours before midnight, sporadic clashes broke out around the city between masked protesters and the police. Some protesters smashed windows and set fires at subway stations and storefronts, prompting the authorities to shut down the entire subway system two hours earlier than normal. The confrontations continued in outlying areas past midnight, although by then many central districts had emptied. The entire subway system, as well as local trains, remained closed on Saturday morning.
A 14-year-old boy received a gunshot wound in a leg, a local hospital authority confirmed, without providing information about the shooting. A police statement said that a plainclothes officer, attacked in Yuen Long, had “fired one shot in self-defense.” It was unclear whether they were related.
While the ban could prompt some peaceful protesters to stay home, it could also incite others to pursue more confrontations. Any uptick in violence could add to the strain on the local economy, as the protests have deterred overseas tourists, mainland shoppers and business travelers. 
Mrs. Lam emphasized repeatedly at a news conference that she was not declaring an emergency, but was acting under a provision in the territory’s colonial-era law that allows the issuance of regulations in response to “a state of serious danger.”
“We are particularly concerned that ” in violent protests, “jeopardizing their safety and even their future,” she said. “As a responsible government, we have a duty to use all available means to stop the escalating violence and restore calmness in society.”
The ban on face masks will be punishable by up to one year in jail and a fine. It will apply to public gatherings of more than few dozen people. But enforcing the ban could prove difficult given their near ubiquity in the movement. Face masks are a common feature among the crowds of protesters, both for security and safety. 
Many protesters wear gas masks and respirators, as do first aid responders and journalists, to protect themselves from tear gas that the police deploy to disperse crowds that engage in violence. Some wear them to protect their identity, fearful they will be captured in photos and by surveillance equipment, then targeted for retaliation. 
Few people attend mass gatherings without one, even during peaceful marches and demonstrations. When Mrs. Lam  last week, many members of the audience who confronted her with difficult questions wore masks.
But the face masks, and the anonymity they provide, have given cover to more violent protesters, who have beaten police officers and vandalized property. Undercover police officers have also used masks to disguise themselves as protesters and make arrests.
As word of the ban spread on Friday during lunchtime, hundreds of people, many wearing face masks, blocked a major road in downtown Hong Kong. They chanted antigovernment slogans, saying it was “unreasonable legislation” and “covering faces is not a crime.” Some called for Mrs. Lam to change course and disband the police. 
“This ban is ridiculous,” said Wilson Lee, a 29-year-old paralegal. “It just shows the government’s incompetence and refusal to listen to any of our concerns. They are just making things worse.” 
After the ban was announced, the city began to prepare for more unrest. Shopping malls and stores closed. Companies, including the global bank HSBC, let workers out early. 
Tens of thousands of people marched through the city’s main roads in a spontaneous protest after work on Friday, as lingering anger over the shooting on Tuesday mixed with new fury over the ban. 
Protesters erected barricades using road signs, trash bins, rocks and traffic cones. Fast food restaurants perceived as having pro-Beijing owners were vandalized. The subway system was closed, and police fired tear gas.
Castor Lai, a 29-year-old dressed in a black shirt, black trousers and a surgical mask, said that he believed the ban on face masks had made tensions worse, not better. “I used to not wear masks in protests, because I mainly attended protests that had been allowed by the police,” he said. “But after the police shot one of our citizens with real guns, we can’t be so passive and peaceful any more.”
Mrs. Lam’s use of emergency powers, a colonial-era law that has not been used in decades, suggests that the government and the police force may have run out of ways to restore order without limiting some civic freedoms. 
The law, the so-called, offers the chief executive extensive legal authority to pass rules without having to go through the legislature. It was last used during deadly riots in 1967, when pro-Communist protesters railed against the British government that oversaw the city. Back then, the authorities used the law to suspend the publication of some leftist newspapers and hold dozens of radicals for months without charges at a special prison in the southwest of the city center. 
Ms. Lam’s government has been debating whether to take such an extraordinary step for weeks, concerned about the message it sends to the city and the world. The face mask ban could hurt the government’s efforts to persuade Hong Kong’s public, tourists and the international business community that the city is generally safe, a reputation that helped make Hong Kong one of the major financial capitals of the world.
Ronny Tong, a member of the Executive Council, the top advisory body to the chief executive, said that he had been wary of invoking the emergency regulations because he feared the stigma it would bring to Hong Kong. But he said that a face mask ban was preferable to a general curfew, an idea recently suggested by some pro-Beijing hard-liners.
Lawmakers, too, debated the efficacy of such rules, pointing to other countries’ experiences. France has such a ban, but it has not prevented many  from wearing them anyway.
“The government has been weighing the pros and cons, and those who are against it argue it wouldn’t help much,” said Jasper Tsang, the founder of the biggest pro-Beijing political party and the president of the legislature until 2016. 
Although the government was deeply split on the issue, Mr. Tsang said that the escalation of violence on Tuesday, including , left the authorities reconsidering every option.
“It appears we need more effective, more stringent measures,” he said. 
Beijing said on Friday it supported Mrs. Lam’s decision to ban the masks, the state television network CCTV reported.
Yang Guang, a spokesman for China’s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said the situation in Hong Kong had reached a critical moment and could not continue unabated.
Critics contend that the ban merely conceals a crackdown on the right to protest. Students have regularly worn masks while joining hands before school and during lunchtime. These so-called human chains are often covered by the local news media, and the masks provide anonymity to youngsters worried about repercussions. 
“Political reasons should not be presented as something done on behalf of students,” Ip Kin-yuen, a pro-democracy lawmaker who represents the education sector said at a news conference on Friday. 
The ban is already stoking protesters’ worries about wider erosions of privacy and personal freedoms.
The protests began this summer over opposition to a law that would have allowed extraditions to the mainland, where the courts are controlled by the Communist Party. The movement has since morphed into a broader call to protect Hong Kong’s autonomy, a special administrative region of China ruled through a policy known as “one country, two systems.”
Although the emergency law is not as powerful as it was back in 1967, Mrs. Lam has wide discretion to issue new regulations — without having to go through the usual legislative process. A curfew could be set. Buildings could be entered and phones could be searched more easily without warrants. Penalties up to life imprisonment could be imposed for offenses that typically carry much lighter sentences.
Teresa Cheng, the secretary for justice, said the government would send the new face mask regulation for review by the legislature, which has the power to block it. But the pro-Beijing majority is unlikely to do so.
“For the international community, any kind of emergency powers will send warning bells,” said Simon Young, a professor at the University of Hong Kong Law School. “Although it may start out with an incremental measure, then nothing’s to stop another measure from being added, and further measures from being added.”
“The only limit is you can’t have the death penalty,” Mr. Young said.

The New York Times,2019-08-13,"In Hong Kong , A Union Runs Off the Rails",1864 ,"
HONG KONG -- As anti-government demonstrations escalate in Hong Kong, each side is staking out increasingly polarized positions, making it difficult to find a path to compromise between the protesters and China's ruling Communist Party.
The demonstrations, which began as a fight against a bill that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be extradited to the mainland, have more broadly morphed into a call for free elections, which largely do not exist in China. To Beijing, it would be a direct challenge to the leadership, tantamount to losing control of Hong Kong. 
  The once peaceful demonstrations have now intensified, coming into conflict with Hong Kong's reputation for order and efficiency. Protesters on Monday filled the airport, crippling one of the world's busiest transportation hubs.
  China is also projecting more power, raising the possibility of more intense and more frequent clashes with the police. An official in Beijing on Monday condemned the actions of the protesters last weekend, casting it as the first signs of ''terrorism.'' The Chinese police also appeared to conduct large-scale exercises across the border from Hong Kong in Shenzhen, a city on the mainland.
  ''We are at a crossroads,'' said Martin Lee, a democracy advocate and former lawmaker. ''The future of Hong Kong -- the future of democracy -- depends on what's going to happen in the next few months.''
  [Laser pointers and traffic cones: creative ways Hong Kong protesters are organizing]
  The unrest is exposing the inherent conflict in the political experiment that began when China reclaimed Hong Kong from Britain in 1997, an ambitious attempt to marry Beijing's brand of authoritarianism with a bastion of civil liberties.
  China's top leader, Xi Jinping, wants to make Hong Kong more like a mainland city, using economic incentives to buy happiness and propaganda to win loyalty. The protesters, who represent a wide swath of Hong Kong, want a government that looks out for their interests, not just Beijing's, to help resolve problems like astronomical housing prices and low wages.
  The two sides no longer seem to recognize each other's concerns.
  The protesters recently adopted a slogan with pro-independence roots: ''Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times.'' Many say they use it to describe their desire for a political voice. But Beijing has held up the slogan as evidence that the protesters support independence.
  The differences started to widen when the city's leader, Carrie Lam, pushed ahead with an unpopular extradition bill, despite a massive rally in early June that drew one million people. To many protesters, her decision drove home the fundamental shortcomings of a leader who is accountable to Beijing.
  Mrs. Lam later suspended the bill but stopped short of formally withdrawing it, infuriating the protesters and drawing them out in greater numbers. In the weeks since, she has refused to make further concessions, including the call for an independent investigation of the police's handling of the protests.
  ''They kind of try to rule Hong Kong the way they rule China. That doesn't really work in an open society,'' said Michael C. Davis, a global fellow at the Wilson Center, a think tank in Washington. ''In Hong Kong, when you push people, when you repress them, when you ignore them -- they push back.''
  But the protesters' challenge to Beijing has also backed the party into a corner. In recent days, protesters have grown more defiant, lighting fires, hurling bricks and gasoline bombs and defacing symbols of Chinese rule.
  The party is determined to not look weak in the face of the tumult, which has quickly become the biggest public resistance to the rule of Mr. Xi since he took power in 2012. The Chinese government has made veiled threats of military intervention and accused protesters of plotting a ''color revolution'' with help from the United States, referring to anti-Communist uprisings it says are orchestrated by the West.
  ''It is now a 'life-or-death' fight for the very future of Hong Kong,'' Wang Zhimin, the head of the central government's office in the city, warned members of Hong Kong's establishment last week. ''There is no room for retreat.''
  'Peaceful Protests Are No Use'
  Crystal Yip, a 20-year-old university student, sat peacefully among the demonstrators at the airport on Monday, which prompted the cancellation of more than 150 flights. She is usually at the front lines of street clashes with the police, snuffing out tear gas canisters, building makeshift barricades and providing cover to protesters who hurl bricks.
  Millions of people -- teachers, construction workers, lawyers, students, and even civil servants -- have filled the streets of Hong Kong to protest against the government in a largely peaceful manner. But a small group of young, confrontational protesters like Ms. Yip is using forceful tactics to get a message across to Beijing.
  ''I know I'm risking my life,'' Ms. Yip said. ''But I've thrown caution to the winds.''
  During pro-democracy protests in 2014, Ms. Yip, then a high school student, hovered on the edge of rallies, terrified of standing up to the authorities. But her attitude recently shifted after watching documentaries about the anti-Russian protests in Ukraine in 2014, and about Edward Leung, a pro-independence activist who was sentenced to six years in prison for rioting.
  ''Peaceful protests are no use,'' Ms. Yip said. ''If violent resistance can work, then why not use it?''
  Ms. Yip and others have embraced more extreme tactics after the failure of Hong Kong's previous political movements, including the Umbrella Revolution of 2014, to deliver free elections. Their anger has grown as the government has encroached further, removing several pro-democracy lawmakers from office and sentencing protesters to long jail terms.
  In that time, Hong Kong's problems -- vast income inequality, a shortage of affordable housing, a dearth of high-paying jobs -- have only seemed to worsen.
  ''I felt so sorry about how we, the Hong Kong people, have been treated,'' said Charlie Li, a construction mechanic who was inspired by the persistence of other protesters.
  Mr. Li, 35, says he has thrown umbrellas and helmets at police officers. He blames the mainland government for driving protesters toward violence. ''They don't listen to us at all,'' Mr. Li said.
  The movement reached a turning point in July, when a small group of activists stormed the legislature, smashing glass walls and spray-painting slogans. Since then, the protesters' list of demands has expanded to include free elections.
  Under the current system, a committee of about 1,200 residents, dominated by Beijing's allies, selects the leader. A small minority of protesters have openly called for Hong Kong's independence, but most complain of feeling politically powerless.
  As China takes a harder line, Hong Kong's veteran pro-democracy politicians also face a dilemma.
  The protests have helped reinvigorate their push. But by continuing to support the younger demonstrators' more extreme tactics, the camp risks endangering the activists and increasing the chances of repression. More than 700 people have been arrested already, some 150 people last weekend alone.
  ''The Communist Party does not forget, and it does not forgive,'' said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London. ''The more successful they are, the more the Chinese government and Xi Jinping feel embarrassed, the higher the price will be.''
  Fears of A 'Color Revolution'
  On the mainland, pundits have warned that Hong Kong is on the brink of disaster. State-run newspapers have called on the public to help protect China's sovereignty. Prominent officials have blamed American diplomats for working as ''black hands'' intent on fomenting an uprising.
  Beijing once worked diligently to keep word of the Hong Kong protests from reaching the mainland, perhaps fearing the unrest could spread. But in recent days, Mr. Xi's government has led an all-out effort to discredit the protesters.
  The sudden shift reflects deepening concern within the party that it is facing a secessionist threat that could undermine Mr. Xi's hard-line image.
  It poses a delicate challenge. Mr. Xi, who has led a broad crackdown on dissent, does not want to be perceived as yielding to the party's foes. Yet he is likely wary of taking drastic action, such as deploying troops, for fear of a broader fallout.
  Such moves could energize his critics, including pro-independence forces in Taiwan, a self-ruling island that China claims as its own. Hong Kong has long served as China's entree into the global financial system and a symbol of the Communist Party's ability to work with free-market societies; an overreaction might alienate big companies and imperil the territory's economy.
  ''Anything too dramatic is going to be quite a high cost. It will be called Tiananmen 2.0, and they don't want that kind of reputational hit,'' said Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese politics at King's College London, referring to Beijing's bloody crackdown on protesters at Tiananmen Square in 1989.
  For the moment, Mr. Xi's strategy appears to be to throw the government's support behind Mrs. Lam and the police while blaming the United States for sowing strife.
  Inside a ballroom at the Wuzhou Guest House in southern China last week, Zhang Xiaoming, Beijing's top official for Hong Kong, told an audience of 500 politicians and business executives from Hong Kong that the protests ''have the clear characteristics of a color revolution,'' a reference to uprisings in the former Soviet bloc that Chinese officials believe drew inspiration from the United States.
  In a smaller meeting after the remarks, Michael Tien, a pro-establishment lawmaker from Hong Kong concerned by the escalating violence, said he confronted mainland officials. He urged them to consider giving in to some of the protesters' demands, including the withdrawal of the extradition bill. ''We must resolve these issues,'' Mr. Tien said he told Mr. Zhang at the meeting, which took place in Shenzhen. Mr. Tien said Mr. Zhang smiled and took a lot of notes but didn't comment on his proposals.
  Mr. Zhang also rejected the protesters' demands for free elections, saying the Chinese government would not be willing to consider any electoral system that does not allow Beijing to screen a list of candidates, according to Mr. Tien. Anything short of that, Mr. Zhang said, would be as good as giving up control of Hong Kong.
  ''I just want the central government to be more concerned about how these future generations will think, beyond the current unrest,'' said Mr. Tien.
  The debate focuses now on whether the ''one country, two systems'' arrangement can survive in Hong Kong, or whether Beijing will seek to make it ''one country, one system.''
  Ronny Tong, a pro-establishment member of the executive council, Mrs. Lam's top advisory body, said he worries that Hong Kong risks losing its special status.
  ''How do you think Beijing will think now?'' he added. ''Do you think they will want to give democracy to people when people are insulting their rule?''"
The New York Times,2019-08-19,Crush of Hong Kong Protesters Defy Police Ban in Show of Strength,1433 ,"
HONG KONG -- A sea of Hong Kong protesters marched through the dense city center in the pouring rain on Sunday, defying a police ban, in a vivid display of the movement's continuing strength after more than two months of demonstrations, days of ugly violence and increasingly vehement warnings from the Chinese government.
People began assembling in the early afternoon in Victoria Park, the starting point of huge peaceful marches in June that were joined by hundreds of thousands of protesters. The police approved the Sunday rally but objected to plans to march to the Central district, citing clashes that had occurred after previous events. But protesters marched anyway. 
  By midafternoon, the park had filled with tens of thousands of people, and the demonstrators began to spill into nearby roads. Protesters holding signs jammed a multilane main road in the Causeway Bay shopping district, stopping traffic and forcing trams to slow to a crawl. The crowd inched toward the park amid heavy rain, shouting, ''People of Hong Kong, keep fighting.''
  Organizers estimated at least 1.7 million people had turned out -- nearly one in four of the total population of more than seven million -- making it the second-largest march of the movement, after a protest by nearly two million on June 16.
  The Hong Kong police released a far lower crowd estimate, saying there were 128,000 protesters in Victoria Park during the peak period.
  But when the march reached the government headquarters in the Admiralty district, the line of people behind stretched nearly two miles, with large crowds still waiting to leave the park.
  ''I came here for the future of Hong Kong and the next generation of Hong Kong. The government has not responded to our demands,'' said Amy Bau, 41, a sign language teacher. ''I have come out to march many times, and I will keep coming out if the government continues to not answer us.''
  Joyce Man, a 26-year-old clerk, said she had joined despite her worries about the military being called upon to quell protests.
  ''I still think my showing up is my responsibility,'' she said. ''The more people in the street today, the safer Hong Kong people are. There's strength when people unite.''
  Roads and sidewalks across Hong Kong Island were filled with people on the march or trying to make their way to the start. Many subway trains skipped stops near the start, citing the large crowds, and traffic was snarled across many neighborhoods.
  The march was peaceful throughout the day, following several days of relative quiet and no use of tear gas by the police over the weekend.
  Lawrence and Season Lee were marching on a highway with their 3-year-old daughter, who tottered along in pink galoshes. Mr. Lee said he knew that violence was always a possibility with the protests, but he felt Sunday's march was too important to miss.
  ''We can't take it anymore,'' he said. ''The government hasn't given any response.''
  It was especially important, the Lees said, that their daughter come along to see what was happening.
  ''We tell her we are all doing this for your future,'' Mrs. Lee said.
  When the march forced Chan Hok-man, a 31-year-old bus driver, to stop, he changed the digital display at the front of his bus to read ''Merry Christmas.'' It was a small way, he said, to show his support.
  Sunday's march shows the movement is still strong, he said.
  ''Just look around!'' he said. ''You see these people, and you can see what they are saying. What do you think?''
  The turnout was being closely watched as a gauge of public sentiment after several tumultuous days. One week ago, riot police officers fired tear gas in one subway station and chased protesters down an escalator in another. At the Hong Kong airport, days of sit-ins swelled to fill the main terminal, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights.
  The situation at the airport took a violent turn on Tuesday when protesters surrounded two men from mainland China, including one identified as a state media journalist, binding them and hitting them. That abuse provoked widespread condemnation from China and apologies from protesters.
  In recent days, the protests have quieted somewhat. The airport limited terminal access to passengers, halting demonstrations there. On Saturday, when protests were held at several places across the city, riot police officers chased off a few hundred black-clad demonstrators who had surrounded a station, but did not fire tear gas. The authorities later said a police officer had fired a bean bag round at a person who had thrown a trash can and other items at a police vehicle in the Mong Kok district.
  Entering the weekend, the repeated call among protesters was to prepare to rally on Sunday.
  The protests began in June over a Hong Kong government proposal that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. That legislation has been shelved, though not completely withdrawn, and the demands of the protesters have grown to include expanded direct elections and amnesty for arrested protesters. Many protesters have complained about the use of force by the police and have accused the authorities of not aggressively investigating thugs who have attacked demonstrators.
  ''This protest started because we didn't agree with a government policy, but as time went on we discovered many bad things about the police and the criminals and other things that make us want to speak up,'' said Paul Lam, 25.
  The Civil Human Rights Front, the group that organized the gathering, issued a long statement criticizing what it called ''Chinese-style repression'' by the Hong Kong police, and called for top officers to step down.
  ''Today's assembly continues the will of the two million people who marched on June 16 against brutality,'' it said. ''We want to gather the most Hong Kongers, and, using peaceful, rational and nonviolent means, unite in spirit and action to express our indignation against police brutality, as well as display Hong Kongers' firm resolve.''
  The Hong Kong government responded that over the past two months the police had faced protesters who blocked roads, vandalized public facilities, set fires and attacked officers with gasoline bombs and bricks.
  ''The police have been handling these illegal acts with tolerance,'' the government said in a statement. ''Only when they were violently attacked and left with no choice did the police use minimum force to disperse protesters in order to restore social order.''
  The Chinese government has criticized the protests in strong terms, calling the airport violence ''close to terrorism'' and warning that the military could be called in. Paramilitary police officers have gathered for drills in the nearby city of Shenzhen, and a video carried by state media late Saturday showed hundreds of riot police officers with shields and batons charging at men dressed in black.
  Ivan Choy, a senior lecturer in the department of government and public administration at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the large turnout showed the criticism from mainland officials and the displays of force had had little effect.
  ''The harsh lines and tough political positions of Chinese officials have not helped stop the movement,'' he said. ''People keep coming out to express their grievances with the Hong Kong government and police.''
  In cities around the world, including London, Toronto, Sydney, Melbourne and New York, protesters took to the streets on Saturday to show support for the planned demonstration in Hong Kong. One activist and organizer in New York estimated that at least 40 cities had planned similar rallies.
  In Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city, scuffles broke out between Hong Kong protesters and pro-Beijing groups. And in Sydney, supporters of the Chinese government denounced the Hong Kong democracy movement and shouted profanities at a handful of counterprotesters.
  In New York, hundreds of people dressed in black, including Alvin Yeung, a Hong Kong lawmaker, and Nathan Law, a prominent Hong Kong activist, gathered in Chinatown for a rally and then snaked over the Manhattan Bridge.
  At one point, demonstrators put their hands over their right eyes to show support for a woman in Hong Kong who was hit in the eye with a projectile during clashes with the police. Across the street, a smaller group of pro-China protesters waved flags and chanted nationalist slogans.
  Mr. Yeung, a vocal critic of the Hong Kong government, said it was important for people around the world to support the Hong Kong protesters. ''Hope is the only thing we have,'' he said."

HONG KONG — The pastor pulled on his respirator and ran directly into the fog of tear gas in central Hong Kong. He was trailed by a homemaker, a retired accountant and a middle-school teacher.
Undaunted by the pandemonium of , they pointed people to safety and poured saline into the eyes of those overcome by the fumes.
With their yellow vests and portable loudspeakers, Pastor Ka-Kit Ao and his volunteers are an unmistakable presence at the antigovernment protests that  this semiautonomous            . They form human cordons between protesters and            . They beg baton-swinging officers to go easy. And they solicit the names of those being hustled away in handcuffs so pro bono lawyers can follow up with assistance.
“I sometimes wonder whether we are doing anything of value, but we can’t just sit at home,” Pastor Ao, 34, said one recent afternoon before heading into the maelstrom with members of his group, Protect the Children.
Now entering their sixth month, Hong Kong’s protests have been notable for, and for the huge throngs willing to defy the authorities with their             and police accountability. Thousands of protesters, including office workers,            , the main business and shopping district, forcing businesses to close and paralyzing traffic and the city’s fabled tram service.
Behind the scenes, this largely leaderless movement has been sustained by a vast network of ordinary people who hand out bottled water and red bean soup at marches, drive home stranded protesters late at night and donate the gas masks that fortify demonstrators during their pitched battles with police. Hong Kong professionals have been especially vital.
Graphic artists create the eye-catching  across the city. Psychologists provide free counseling to the emotionally distressed. And emergency room doctors, working in clandestine clinics, set shattered bones.
One measure of community spirit can be heard many nights at 10 p.m., when residents in densely packed neighborhoods open their windows and shout protest slogans to the heavens. Another is expressed through the crowdfunding campaigns that have raised millions of dollars for medical treatment, legal defense funds and other expenses.
“Without this public support, the movement would have lost steam a lot sooner,” said Victoria Hui, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame and the author of a book about , the 2014 pro-democracy protests that fizzled after 10 weeks. “It encourages young people to keep going, giving them the sense they are not alone and that what they are doing is righteous.”
Although actions like setting the man on fire risk eroding support, the protest movement so far has enjoyed broad backing among Hong Kong’s seven million people. A  by the Chinese University of Hong Kong found that nearly 60 percent of respondents approved of the protesters’            , agreeing that they were justified in the face of an increasingly aggressive police response and a government unwilling to compromise.
This public support presents a thorny challenge to the authorities, who have been hoping to quell the protests by driving a wedge between  to their cause.
“The more the government suppresses this movement and tries to scare people, the more people will step out and stand up,” said Pastor Roy Chan, a founder of Protect the Children, which has nearly 200 members.
The encrypted messaging app Telegram serves as the town hall for the support network, with dozens of channels that match volunteers to those in need. Most prolific are the channels offering rides to protesters affected by the subway shutdowns that the authorities impose to dampen protest turnout. The rides also help protesters avoid the police sweeps that target public buses.
Like many drivers, Patrick Chan, 38, a garment factory manager, said fear of arrest kept him away from the protests, most of which the police have deemed illegal. Guilt and shame, though, are powerful motivators.
Mr. Chan spends hours in his beat-up BMW sedan ferrying weary, sweat-drenched protesters to housing complexes across the city.
“These young people are trying to right the wrongs that we have long been avoiding,” he said, referring to Beijing’s two-decade effort to chip away at the vaunted liberties that differentiate this former British colony from mainland China. “They are paying with their futures, risking the possibility of being locked up for years. We owe them.”
The sense of public service has also mobilized dozens of doctors, nurses and medics. Much of their work takes place in secret. That is because all but the most grievously injured protesters avoid Hong Kong’s hospitals following the arrest in June of several people who had sought care for broken bones and blunt trauma. These days, the injured are sometimes treated at clandestine clinics that provide X-rays and rudimentary surgery.
Dr. Tim Wong works the protests after his regular hospital shift. An emergency room doctor, he decided to act after the police made a number of arrests at his hospital, which he declined to name for fear that it might endanger his employment.
“Since then, no one has come to our emergency room for treatment, unless they are escorted by the police,” he said. “It’s outrageous. Hospitals should be sanctuaries.”
One recent evening, he hovered near the front lines of a skirmish as Molotov cocktails, bricks and tear gas canisters arced overhead. Many of those needing medical treatment were bystanders caught up in the mayhem.
Just then, Pastor Ao and another member of his group rushed by carrying a man injured by a tear-gas canister. All three of them were weeping. “I can’t believe this is happening to our city,” the pastor wailed as they dragged the man to a first aid clinic inside a Methodist Church that has become a beacon for protesters.
Earlier that afternoon, Pastor Ao and scores of volunteers had gathered at a subway station to plot the day’s movements. After dividing up into teams of seven, he reminded everyone to refrain from chanting slogans and urged them to be polite to law enforcement authorities.
“They might call us cockroaches but we should refer to them as police officers,” he said. Then everyone bowed their heads in prayer. “May we have God’s protection and the patience, love and wisdom to deal with the police,” Pastor Ao said.
Volunteers say the police rarely return the favor, treating them as antagonists. In September, the police were widely criticized after  that appeared to show a knot of officers kicking a Protect the Children member as he lay on the ground. The man, wearing the group’s trademark yellow vest, was later arrested.
At a news conference, a senior police official dismissed allegations of abuse, suggesting that the video had been doctored and that what many saw as a person was actually “a yellow object.” In the weeks that followed, the group’s ranks swelled with new recruits, Pastor Ao said.
Many of the group’s volunteers are retirees like Ah Lin He. A fiery, reed-thin woman, Ms. He, 68, was born in the Chinese city of Guangzhou and swam to Hong Kong in 1972 to escape the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. She doggy-paddled for 10 hours with five other people. Only three of them made it to shore.
“I’ve seen the repression and madness that can be unleashed by the Communists in China,” she said as the group trudged to a protest that .
Walking beside her was Joe Pao, a 29-year-old pastor, who joined the group after a brief stint as a protester. “I realized I could do something more useful than throwing bricks,” Pastor Pao said.
He acknowledged that his role as a putative peacemaker was rarely gratifying. Most of his work involves urging the police to exercise restraint. “When they catch people, we tell them to please respect the powers they have and not abuse them,” he said. “The impact is definitely small.”
The majority of protest supporters operate more independently. Nam Kwan, a cultural foundation administrator, has fed, housed and comforted scores of youths whose parents, enraged by their participation in the protests, tossed them out of their homes.
She traces her transformation from silent sympathizer to frenetic den mother to June 12, when the police by firing rubber bullets and beanbag rounds at unarmed protesters.
“When I heard the first gunshot, a bell rang inside me and I automatically found my place,” she said. “Nowadays my phone is on 24 hours a day because I’m afraid I might miss urgent messages or calls for help.”
In addition to buying protective gear for protesters, she coordinates financial support and car pools from wealthy friends eager to help but reluctant to do so publicly. Oftentimes, she finds herself on the street, dispensing hugs or patiently listening to the worries of young protesters.
“Every time these kids go to the front lines, they fear for their lives,” she said. “But what they fear more is abandonment, that one day we will all turn our backs and leave them alone.”

HONG KONG — A subway train derailed in Hong Kong on Tuesday, injuring at least five passengers and snarling the morning rush-hour commute in a city whose transit system has been routinely disrupted by three months of pro-democracy protests.
One man and four women were hospitalized after the accident near a major station on the city’s Kowloon Peninsula, a government spokesman said. The Fire Services Department said their injuries included light scratches and neck and shoulder injuries.
Such accidents are exceedingly rare in Hong Kong, and there was no indication that the crash was related to the protests that have prompted the former British colony’s worst political crisis since it was handed back to Chinese control in 1997. But the accident nevertheless stirred initial concerns that it was linked to the unrest.
The crash comes after , in which the Hong Kong police fired tear gas and water cannons after protesters vandalized a subway station and attacked government offices with bricks and gasoline bombs.
Adi Lau, the operations director for Hong Kong’s subway operator, the MTR Corporation, told reporters on Tuesday that three middle carriages of the 12-carriage train had derailed. He said it was too early to draw conclusions about the cause of the accident.
At a separate news conference, Frank Chan, Hong Kong’s secretary for transport and housing, called the accident a “very serious incident.”
“We will not rule out any possibility, but at this stage we won’t speculate on any particular suggestions,” Mr. Chan told reporters on Tuesday when asked about the possible causes of the crash. He added that an investigation was underway.
The MTR Corporation’s shares fell on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange at the start of trading Tuesday, but had recovered slightly by midmorning.
MTR stations have emerged as a prime target of vandalism during recent protests, apparently because protesters are angry at the company for having allowed riot police officers to enter its stations and beat or round up protesters. On Sunday, protesters set up barricades and broke glass railings inside one downtown station, and set a fire outside another.
The derailment on Tuesday morning occurred as a train entered the Hung Hom Station, which sits across the city’s harbor from Hong Kong Island and is also the terminus for rail service to the Chinese mainland.
One of the passengers, Dav Cheung, 21, said in an interview that the train had vibrated and slanted horizontally as it approached the Hung Hom platform. He said he heard a loud noise coming from beneath the train about 10 seconds before it screeched to a halt.
“It was like an earthquake,” he said.
Passengers were forced to leave the train, which was split into two sections, by walking across the tracks.

The New York Times ,2019-07-26,Hong Kong Protests Spread to Airport as City Fears More Unrest,1189 ,"
HONG KONG — Black-clad demonstrators rallied in Hong Kong’s airport on Friday, filling the arrivals hall of one of the world’s busiest terminals as the city braced for another weekend of potentially combustible protests.
Activists also signaled that despite objections from the police, they would continue with plans for a Saturday rally against mob violence in Yuen Long, a district near the mainland Chinese border where last weekend a group of men  and on nearby streets.
That attack on Sunday, which left at least 45 people injured, was apparently meant to intimidate the protesters who have been holding demonstrations in the city for weeks. But the men, many of whom were masked and dressed in white T-shirts, also lashed out at train passengers who had no apparent connection to the demonstrations.
The police — who failed to stop the mob, and initially made no arrests — have since detained 12 people in connection with the train station attacks, including some accused of having connections to . The authorities have said they object to the Yuen Long rally on Saturday because of the risk of clashes, with tensions running high between pro-democracy protesters and residents of the district’s villages, who are more conservative and supportive of the establishment.
[.]
The prospect of more violence this weekend poses another challenge for Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s embattled chief executive, who is under pressure from Beijing to restore order in the semiautonomous Chinese city. On Sunday, hours before the mob attack, protesters defaced the Chinese government’s main offices in the city, in a direct rebuke of the Communist leadership in China.
Mrs. Lam is also facing  sympathetic to the protesters, who have urged her to heed the demonstrators’ calls to set up an independent commission to investigate police conduct during the unrest. Several police unions released a letter Friday urging Mrs. Lam to oppose such a move.
The protests in Hong Kong began weeks ago, over a now-suspended government proposal that would allow extraditions to mainland China. They have since expanded to include other issues, like accusations that the police have used excessive force, as well as demands that direct elections be held for chief executive and for more seats in the local legislature.
During the rally at the airport on Friday, protesters, including some airline employees, chanted slogans and distributed leaflets listing demands, including a full withdrawal of the extradition bill. They also set up another of the many so-called Lennon Walls that have gone up around the city (named after one that sprung up in Prague under Communist rule), consisting of slogans and messages of support for the protest movement, most on Post-It notes.
To promote the airport rally, protesters created a video  telling visitors to beware of mob attacks in Hong Kong. It referred to the police’s failure to protect the train passengers in Yuen Long on Sunday: “It is a safety requirement that you remain alert and vigilant at all times, because the police will no longer answer your calls,” it said.
Jeremy Tam, a lawmaker and former pilot,  attributed to a group of air traffic controllers that warned of a “noncooperation movement” unless the government responded to the protesters’ demands.
“As we hear the people cry and witness the city descend into chaos, we feel that it is not right to continue to perform our duties silently as if nothing has happened and let the abusers get away with their evil deeds,” it said.
Concerns about Saturday’s protest were running high.
Matthew Cheung, the second-ranking official in Hong Kong, warned that a rally held in spite of the police’s formal objection would be unlawful. But in a news conference on Friday, he acknowledged that people were still likely to attend, and he called on them to be “peaceful and rational” and not enter villages in Yuen Long where clashes might occur.
Mr. Cheung also apologized for the government’s handling of the violence in Yuen Long, where many have accused the police of being slow to respond.
“If it’s for this event, the method of how we handled it, and how the police force said they fell short of the citizens’ expectations, I am absolutely willing to apologize to the citizens,” he said.
Police officials said they received calls about the Yuen Long attacks at 10:41 p.m. on Sunday, and that two officers arrived at 10:52 p.m. But they retreated because they were outnumbered, and 40 riot police officers arrived at 11:20 p.m., officials said.
The men in white had been seen gathering hours earlier, and warnings about an attack on protesters had circulated in the area as early as a day before the attacks.
“We understand that the outcome of our actions might have slightly fallen short to the citizens’ expectations,” Tsang Ching-fo, a police official in New Territories North, where Yuen Long is located, said on Thursday. “We are also very saddened that civilians got hurt because we were not able to stop the event.”
A week before the attack at the train station, a representative of the Chinese government’s office in Hong Kong, known as the liaison office, had urged Yuen Long residents to drive activists away, , citing a recording of his remarks.
“We won’t allow them to come to Yuen Long to cause trouble,” Li Jiyi, the director of the liaison office’s local district office, said at a community banquet, according to the report.
The liaison office dismissed any reports linking it to the Yuen Long violence as “malicious rumors,” according to a report .
This week, Chinese state media outlets, which previously ignored the Hong Kong demonstrations, have begun running coverage that is sharply critical of them. Chinese officials have also denounced the demonstrators, particularly since the liaison office was vandalized on Sunday, with protesters painting graffiti on the exterior and splashing ink on the national crest.

Students, armed with homemade weapons, remained bunkered down on a university campus awaiting a police operation to remove them.
A standoff at a Hong Kong university between protesters and the police entered a second day on Monday with riot officers lobbing tear gas and firing rubber bullets at some students trying to flee the besieged campus, while others stayed bunkered inside with homemade weapons.  
  At least 38 people were injured in a protracted battle at the university, Hong Kong Polytechnic, on Sunday, the city's Hospital Authority said, after a bloody battle in which a police officer was struck by an arrow and demonstrators set a police van on fire. 
  A core group of students remained inside the walls awaiting an expected operation to remove them from the campus.
  As protests raged across the city, Hong Kong's High Court struck down a contentious ban on the wearing of face masks in public. The court found that the ban, enacted in October, violated the territory's mini-constitution, know as the Basic Law. 
  The Hong Kong protests began in June over legislation, since scrapped, that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, and have expanded to include a broad range of demands for police accountability and greater democracy.
  Here's the latest:
  Court rules against ban on face masks. 
  The city's High Court on Monday struck down a ban on wearing face masks in public, issuing a blow to the local government's ability to characterize the ongoing protests as a situation that requires the invocation of emergency powers. 
  The ban, which was enacted in October, quickly inflamed tensions in the city and set off a series of violent clashes. The city's chief executive, Carrie Lam, imposed the ban without seeking legislative approval by invoking powers granted under the rarely used Emergency Regulations Ordinance, or E.R.O. 
  In its ruling, the court said the ban violated the city's mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, because it was too vague and endangered the ability of the Legislative Council, or LegCo, to make the territory's laws.
  ''The E.R.O. is so wide in its scope, the conferment of powers so complete, its conditions for invocation so uncertain and subjective, the regulations made thereunder invested with such primacy, and the control by the LegCo so precarious, that we believe it is not compatible with the constitutional order laid down by the Basic Law,'' the court said in its ruling. 
  Masks have been worn by protesters since the early days of the movement, as a way for protesters to conceal their identities and protect themselves from the pepper spray and tear gas routinely deployed by the police. Many protesters saw the law a pretext that would allow officers to arrest nonviolent demonstrators in order to discourage people from joining the street actions. 
  The morning after.
  Scores of people were arrested by the police on Monday morning near the university. A large group of arrested people were seen seated outside a hotel in the Tsim Sha Tsui district of Kowloon, their hands zip-tied behind their backs. 
  It was unclear if the bulk of the arrestees were protesters trying to flee the campus or allies who had arrived at the university after responding to calls for help evacuating protesters trapped on campus. 
  At least 500 protesters remained on campus, after the police thwarted their attempts to escape by firing rubber bullets and volleys of tear gas, in an apparent break of a temporary truce that the university president, Jin-Guang Teng, said he had negotiated with the police.
  The police said in a statement on Facebook that ''a large group of masked rioters who have been holed up'' at the university ''suddenly charged at police cordons,'' including many who held firebombs.
  The police said they urged those inside the campus to ''drop their weapons'' and leave. Protesters were wary of following the police's order to evacuate, as some were arrested after trying to leave, according to witnesses.
  Protests are expected to erupt across the city.
  The police fired tear gas in the nearby neighborhood of Jordan, where roadblocks made with brick clusters and bamboo poles disrupted traffic. 
  Protesters have called for another strike on Monday in support of the campus occupiers, with demonstrations expected in the city's Central business district. 
  Trains at several sections of the city's rail network have been suspended or delayed."

Tensions increased as police arrived at one of the world’s most important transportation hubs.
Tensions between police and protesters flared on Tuesday at Hong Kong International Airport, after the second consecutive day of protests forced the airport authority to .
Thousands of protesters swarmed the terminals, disrupting operations at one of the world’s most important transportation hubs. Frustrated travelers confronted protesters blocking their way through the airport, leading to arguments and scuffles, at least one of which led to a physical altercation.
There are reports of clashes, pepper spray and protesters being arrested. 
In a statement issued late Tuesday, the authority advised all passengers to leave the terminals, saying that operations have been “seriously disrupted.”  
Here’s what travelers to and from Hong Kong need to know. 
What’s happening in Hong Kong?
Sparked by proposed legislation that would have changed             between Hong Kong and other places, including mainland China, antigovernment protests in Hong Kong are currently in their third month. Previous protests have occurred mainly downtown, in popular shopping areas and near government buildings. 
A small group of protesters had been at the airport on Monday morning and the crowds grew throughout the day, eventually filling the arrival hall before more protesters went to the departure hall. The airport authority canceled, rerouted or rescheduled more than 150 flights on Monday. 
Thousands of protesters returned on Tuesday, believing Monday’s demonstration had succeeded in drawing international attention to their plight.

Is it safe to travel to Hong Kong? 
The Hong Kong Tourism Commission has said that the city is safe and open for tourists, but, according to preliminary numbers from the Hong Kong Tourism Board, the city saw a double-digit decline in visitor arrivals in the second half of July.
“The travel trade has reported that the number of forward bookings in August and September has dropped significantly,” a Hong Kong Tourism Board spokeswoman said. 
Several governments have increased their safety alerts in recent weeks. 
Five days ago, the U.S. State Department issued a level two , warning travelers to “exercise increased caution in Hong Kong due to civil unrest.” 
On its , the Australian government says that it recommends that travelers “exercise a high degree of caution in Hong Kong,” and mentions that the protests at the airport have intensified and caused “significant disruption.” The Australian Consulate in Hong Kong has sent officials to the airport to help Australians travelers. 
Canadian authorities are encouraging travelers to also “ in Hong Kong because of ongoing large-scale demonstrations.” 
Why are protests happening at the airport? 
Hong Kong International Airport is one of the busiest airports in the world, a gateway to 220 destinations worldwide, with about 1,100 flights daily. It is a crucial connection point for regional air travel and last year . A small group of protesters had been at the airport on Monday morning and the crowds grew throughout the day, eventually filling the arrival hall before more protesters went to the departure hall. Many returned on Tuesday, believing Monday’s demonstration had succeeded in drawing international attention to their plight. 
“Interrupting air travel is one of the best ways to galvanize attention of elites, opinion-makers and the type of people that take flights, especially international flights,” said Scott Keyes, co-founder and chief executive of . 
Many travelers stuck at the airport have expressed frustration at the situation. 
“I am sympathetic for people who want changes, but I’m not sure it’s the best way to go about it,” said Pauline Price, a 52-year-old cinema manager from New Zealand. “The ad hoc protests destabilize the city. The ad hoc disruption just interfere with Hong Kong life so much that they might lose sympathy.”
I’m on an arriving flight. What should I expect when my plane lands? 
On social media platforms, journalists, travelers and protesters shared photos and videos that show barricades made of stacked luggage carts, protesters blocking paths through the airport, and people shouting at each other, running away from protesters, hitting one another and, in one case, a protester 
How long will flights be grounded? 
The best way to find out if your flight is canceled or delayed is to get in touch with the airline you’re traveling on. Some airlines, like Air Canada, have put in place a flexible rebooking policy for customers who want to change their travel plans to or from Hong Kong. Others, like British Airways, are offering the option to rebook on another date or receive a full refund. 
If you have travel insurance, it’s important to determine if it covers delays or interruptions of this nature. 
“Say you live in New York and you’re heading to Hong Kong, but now you’re delayed because the airport is closed, or you’re in Hong Kong and looking to come home, or you’re traveling through Hong Kong, but now you’re delayed,” said Michael Grossman, who runs Starr Insurance Companies’ travel insurance business. Any of those scenarios, he said, might be covered under the trip delay benefit. 
I’m traveling soon. What can I do and where can I get information? 
Check with your airline about the status of your flight, or, if you booked your trip through a travel agent, you should get in touch with the agent if they have not reached out to you. 
“As soon as we got word on the situation, we ran a list to identify our impacted passengers and began alerting them regarding flight cancellations and alternatives,” said Peter Vlitas, senior vice president of airline relations for Travel Leaders Group, a travel agency organization. 
If you must travel to or from Hong Kong and have a China visa, you can go through Shenzhen or Guangzhou and travel by train to Hong Kong, Mr. Vlitas said. There is also a ferry that runs from Hong Kong to Shenzhen; it takes about an hour.
“Given the situation, airlines are offering full refunds for travel up to Aug. 15. However, that date may be extended as events continue to develop,” Mr. Vlitas said. 
“We recommend that impacted travelers consider looking for alternate modes of transportation or consider another airport if it is convenient,” said Johnny Quach, Chief Product Officer at , the world’s largest organization for air passenger rights. 
Which airlines are affected and what are they doing? 
More than 120 airlines fly in and out of Hong Kong International Airport, including most major world carriers, like British Airways, American Airlines, United Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific Airways. 
Virgin Atlantic’s Tuesday flight to London is now scheduled to leave Hong Kong on Wednesday morning. 
Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways canceled several flights to and from Hong Kong on Monday and Tuesday.  The airline told its customers to postpone “nonessential travel” out of the city for the rest of the day and on Wednesday.

The New York Times ,2019-08-28,Straining Through the Tear Gas,900 ,"
In Hong Kong, flinching at echoes of China’s ill-fated Tiananmen democracy movement of 1989.
HONG KONG — Across the street that was about to become a battlefield, forces massed on each side tensely adjusted their gas masks, nervously fiddled with their weapons.
The riot police, with pistols at their hips, were ready with tear-gas grenade launchers and guns loaded with rubber bullets. Down the street, young pro-democracy protesters set up barriers to slow the police, and stretched fishing line across the road to trip them.
Both sides wore helmets and gas masks, and both clutched sticks or truncheons. Then the police charged and a sedate neighborhood erupted into a fury of tear gas, flying rocks and Molotov cocktails.
The Hong Kong and Chinese governments have mishandled these protests from the beginning, and both sides are now escalating and becoming increasingly violent. That face-off on the street was a microcosm of a larger standoff between China’s president, Xi Jinping, determined to impose his kind of order, and countless Hong Kongers, equally determined to breathe freely.
My heart is with the protesters. Hong Kongers are highly educated and of course they deserve the right to choose their leaders. China under Xi has been nibbling away at Hong Kong’s autonomy, just as he has been ratcheting up repression at home — so it’s impossible not to be inspired by up to two million brave Hong Kongers marching to gain rights that are taken for granted in so much of the world.
When a small, skinny man in shorts and a tank top stood with his arms outstretched to try to protect protesters from a police officer pointing a gun at them — the scene of  — how could we not be moved? 
But I also feel a sense of foreboding. It’s probably only a matter of time before someone is killed, and that will unleash a new cycle of recrimination, escalation and violence. There are so many parallels to the Tiananmen student democracy movement that 30 years ago — and I wonder if Beijing may ultimately deploy troops, perhaps from the paramilitary People’s Armed Police, to crush these protests as well.
As with the 1989 Tiananmen protests, these in Hong Kong are partly about democracy but also about economic frustrations. The average Hong Konger enjoys housing space of , just a hair bigger than the average New York City parking space.
As in 1989, these protests snowballed because of government mishandling and arrogance. China’s hard line has also deeply antagonized Hong Kongers. Graffiti everywhere denounce “ChiNazi” influence, and people scold me when I refer to the population here with the old, familiar term of “Hong Kong Chinese.” No, people object: We’re not Chinese. Say “Hong Konger.”
Thus one of Xi’s legacies: He has tarnished the word “Chinese.”
Hong Kong’s police have sometimes been restrained, other times heavy handed, firing tear-gas grenades in ways that  are dangerous and excessive. The authorities are also            using more than 100 Chinese gangsters, known as triads, to do their dirty work and club and disperse protesters.
The Hong Kong chief executive, Carrie Lam, who has all the charisma of a fish in a tank in a Cantonese restaurant, is generally regarded as having bungled the affair from the beginning. Her next step may be to invoke emergency powers — akin to martial law — and crack down further on dissent; this may just backfire and inflame the protests.
On the other side, protesters have also escalated their tactics and become increasingly violent. More and more people — although still a tiny minority of the overall pool of protesters — hurl rocks or Molotov cocktails at the police. Hong Kongers say they have absorbed the lesson that the government pays no attention to purely peaceful demonstrations. I believe the violence is a mistake that increases the risk of a crackdown, but the public frustration is so great that I found few people ready to condemn it.
One more eerie parallel with Tiananmen: Many protesters scoff at the possibility of a military crackdown.
“Western pressure will prevent a Tiananmen from happening here,” a 29-year-old man told me during a march the other day.
A young couple, Charles and Cindy, came out in matching helmets, gas masks and goggles to stand up for democracy, but they told me that Beijing would never use force to crush the protests.
“The free world will support Hong Kong,” Charles told me. And Cindy pointed to Hong Kong’s economic importance to China, adding, “We are still very valuable to them.”
True enough, and people often say that China will never kill the goose that lays golden eggs. But as Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, , that phrase came into existence only because “history is littered with the carcasses of decapitated geese.”
In the run-up to the massacres of 1989, idealistic protesters often told me that their cause was invincible. And then I watched tanks roll over righteousness.

The New York Times ,2019-04-08,9 Hong Kong Democracy Advocates Convicted for Role in 2014 Protests,932 ,"
HONG KONG — Nine democracy activists on Tuesday were convicted by a Hong Kong court on public nuisance charges for their roles in the protest movement that led to the monthslong occupation of major intersections in the city five years ago.
The activists face prison terms of up to seven years.
The protests, which became known as the Umbrella Movement, galvanized the city and sought to force Hong Kong’s top official to step down and the government to accept more democratic means to elect future leaders.
While the protests had no formal leaders, three of the people on trial — Chu Yiu-ming, a retired pastor, and two professors, Benny Tai and Chan Kin-man — were founders of Occupy Central With Love and Peace, one of the main groups advocating civil disobedience to demand changes to Hong Kong’s electoral system.
The three were convicted of conspiracy to commit public nuisance. Mr. Tai and Mr. Chan were also convicted of incitement to commit public nuisance.
The convictions were swiftly criticized by Hong Kong democracy advocates, human rights groups and politicians in the United States and Britain.
“At a time when most people would have thought that the aim of the Hong Kong government should be to bring the whole community together, it seems appallingly divisive to use anachronistic common-law charges in a vengeful pursuit of political events which took place in 2014,” Chris Patten, the last colonial governor of Hong Kong, said in a statement.
Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Representative James P. McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in a statement that the convictions “effectively punish peaceful political dissent and narrow the space for free expression and peaceful assembly.”
The Occupy Central founders had envisioned a sit-in of two or three days, but student protesters who occupied a square near the Hong Kong government headquarters pre-empted their plans. When the police used pepper spray and later tear gas against the student protesters, .
The Umbrella Movement, which took its name from the shield protesters used against pepper spray, lasted 79 days, with participants camping out behind homemade barriers on the streets of some of the city’s busiest districts.
The activists on trial argued that they were being disproportionately blamed for acts of civil disobedience meant to help the people of the city.
“This is a case about some Hong Kong people who love Hong Kong very much and believe that only through the introduction of genuine universal suffrage could a door be opened to resolving the deep-seated conflicts in Hong Kong,” Mr. Tai  during the trial last year.
Judge Johnny Chan of the District Court rejected the argument of the Occupy Central leaders that the protest was an appropriate exercise of free speech, finding that they knew “the occupy movement would impinge unreasonably upon the rights of others.”
The protests have been followed by a long stretch of frustration and defeat for pro-democracy activists.
Hong Kong’s leader at the time, Leung Chun-ying, refused to step down, though . Lawmakers             that would have allowed Hong Kong voters to directly elect their leader, known as the chief executive, but only from a slate of candidates approved by a pro-establishment election committee.
Some young activists took to politics after the defeat of the Umbrella Movement but found themselves blocked from holding office.
In 2016 and 2017, Hong Kong courts  for altering their oaths of office to include phrases of protest that echoed the calls of the Umbrella Movement. Several others have been disqualified from running in recent elections by officials who have ruled that they do not sincerely believe that Hong Kong is an “inalienable part” of China.
Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” arrangement that allows it to maintain its own local government and legal system, with far more robust protection of civil liberties than in mainland China. The Basic Law, Hong Kong’s local constitution, envisions a directly elected chief executive, but the central government has maintained that the candidates must pass a strict nomination procedure, .
In addition to the three Occupy Central founders, Tanya Chan and Shiu Ka-chun, both current lawmakers; Lee Wing-tat, a former lawmaker; Tommy Cheung and Eason Chung, who were student leaders; and Raphael Wong, a member of the League of Social Democrats, a pro-democracy party, were convicted of public nuisance charges.
The government has prosecuted 266 people over the Umbrella Movement, with 118 convicted, according to .
Last year, Hong Kong’s highest court  of six to eight months given to three student leaders, Joshua Wong, Alex Chow and Nathan Law. But the court also affirmed tougher sentencing guidelines for future offenses that “cross the line of acceptability, including acts of incitement, particularly so if violence is involved.”

President Trump made his most extensive comments yet on Hong Kong’s protest movement, and suggested that its fate be tied to a trade deal. 
HONG KONG — In his most extensive comments on the months of unrest in Hong Kong, President Trump said on Wednesday that China should “humanely” settle the situation before a trade deal is reached. 
His comments, delivered on Twitter, for the first time tied the fate of pro-democracy protesters to a trade deal with China, a top administration priority. 
Mr. Trump praised President Xi Jinping of China as “a great leader” and suggested a “personal meeting” could help solve the crisis in . He also said “China is not our problem, though            .” 
“Of course China wants to make a deal,” . “Let them work humanely with Hong Kong first!”
He reiterated his support for Mr. Xi again on Thursday, saying that if the Chinese leader met personally with the protesters “there would be a happy and enlightened ending to the Hong Kong problem.”

His comments on Wednesday stopped short of praising or supporting the protesters, as both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have done, and he did not explain what he meant by “humanely” working with Hong Kong. 
One day earlier, Mr. Trump took no stance when asked by reporters. 
“The Hong Kong thing is a very tough situation,” he said on Tuesday. “Very tough. We’ll see what happens. But I’m sure it’ll work out.” 
He added: “I hope it works out for everybody, including China. I hope it works out peacefully. I hope nobody gets hurt. I hope nobody gets killed.”
He had previously called the protests “riots,” repeating language used by the Chinese government that is strongly disputed by protesters, and said, “That’s between Hong Kong and that’s between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China.” "
The New York Times,2019-10-27,Young Front-Line Protesters in Hong Kong Keep a Fuse Blazing,1892 ,"
HONG KONG -- Fat Boy is a college dropout with a youthful blush of acne who excels at playing video games and lives with his mother. He is also a wily commander who leads a ragtag band of protesters willing to risk injury and arrest as they face off against the police.
Fat Boy oversees 50 or so Hong Kong protesters, ages 15 to 35, who focus their attacks on the police, government offices and Chinese-owned banks or other businesses they view as hostile to their movement. Their weapons -- bricks, poles and Molotov cocktails -- are often met with tear gas and rubber bullets. Occasionally, the police have responded with live fire. 
  They are part of a core of combative young agitators, garbed in black, who have come to define the antigovernment protests that have convulsed this semiautonomous territory for more than four months and that have posed a bold challenge to the authority of China's ruling Communist Party.
  ''You have to earn your rights and freedom,'' Fat Boy, 20, said one afternoon this month at his apartment as he and three team members picked at takeout food and talked about their anxieties and aspirations. ''For this, we can have no regrets.''
  With a self-confidence that frequently veered to bravado, he showed off photos from the day he hot-wired an excavator at a construction site and drove it to the entrance of a police station.
  ''After I did that, other people copied me,'' he said.
  The protesters have escalated their use of violent tactics, smashing storefronts, setting bonfires at subway stations and taking justice into their own hands.
  On Oct. 13, a protester stabbed a police officer in the throat with a box cutter, leaving him in serious condition. The same day, a homemade bomb detonated by cellphone exploded in a sidewalk planter, though it caused no damage or injuries.
  The police warned that the political movement had entered a dangerous new phase.
  Hard-line protesters and the authorities are locked in an impasse that feels as if it is edging closer to a fatality or perhaps even an intervention by Chinese troops that could further endanger the civil liberties long enjoyed by the territory's seven million residents.
  The protesters say they have been driven to extremes by a government that won't meet their demands for greater democracy and an investigation into police conduct. The authorities refuse partly because they believe further concessions would only encourage more violence.
  Francis Lee, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who has conducted public opinion surveys on the unrest, said the police and protesters were trapped in a vicious cycle of surging violence.
  ''We have reached a stage where it is difficult for either side to escalate their actions without creating backlash,'' he said.
  The city's leaders and the police, seeking to drive a wedge between the front-line protesters and the broader public, have cast the demonstrators as rioters and violent vigilantes. Moderates who support the movement's goals express a growing fear that the violence plays into Beijing's hands and will undermine public support.
  For now, Hong Kong's residents continue to back the protests by wide margins despite the violence, said Professor Lee, whose polling suggests that at least creating an independent commission on police conduct would go a long way toward defusing the crisis.
  ''These demands are not radical at all,'' he said. ''Doing them is very likely to be adequate to kick-start a process of de-escalation.''
  Fat Boy, his three teammates and one other front-line protester agreed to be interviewed on the condition that they be identified by nicknames or first names only, for fear of being arrested.
  The teammates include Jeff, a 24-year-old musician and skateboarder who quit his full-time job renovating apartments to devote himself to the protest movement; Kitty, a 21-year-old English major who recently left school for the same reason; and Tyler, 34, a construction manager who supports the brigade by supplying the helmets and carbon fiber shields that protect its members during confrontations with the police.
  They said they wanted to push back against the Hong Kong government's narrative likening them to thugs and mainland China's propaganda that describes them as separatists. Their goals: to seek police accountability and secure the universal suffrage that they say Beijing promised when this former British colony was returned to China in 1997.
  Like many Hong Kong youths, the front-line protesters assert an identity that, unlike in generations past, is fiercely distinct from that of mainland China.
  Their anger is rooted in a growing sense that China's Communist Party has worked swiftly to erode Hong Kong's civil liberties, and as examples they point to the ousting of opposition lawmakers and detention of city booksellers by the mainland authorities.
  Samuel, 24, a freckle-faced protester and aspiring songwriter who is not part of Fat Boy's group, explained, ''We just don't want to become like those Chinese who have become accustomed to living without freedom.''
  During protests, Samuel erects roadblocks to slow down advancing columns of officers. He and the others defended their tactics and said they were being driven by mounting police brutality and an inflexible government.
  A few of the democracy advocates conceded that the homemade bomb gave them pause.
  Longhaired, lanky and contemplative, Jeff, the musician, equivocated when asked whether he approved of the bombing. He said that he didn't think he could use such a weapon but that he might reconsider if its sole aim was to sow chaos and disperse charging police officers.
  ''I used to be someone who wouldn't even throw a brick,'' he said. ''But every time I encounter an escalation by the police, my limit goes higher.''
  With their gas masks and sleek, ninjalike attire, the front-liners are an unmistakable presence during demonstrations. They have adopted the martial arts hero Bruce Lee's ruminations on flexibility in the face of obstacles -- ''Be water, my friend'' -- saying they should behave like a wave that appears at once to pound the enemy and then promptly recedes into countless drops that cannot be contained.
  They coordinate moves on encrypted messaging apps and are aided by four tacticians on three continents who remotely monitor the street battles.
  It is impossible to know the number of antigovernment protesters who have embraced a more violent approach, but Fat Boy says he is aware of as many as 30 groups whose leaders meet face to face once or twice a month. The groups operate autonomously, with infrequent contact, an arrangement that helps protect them from arrest.
  Fat Boy and those who direct the activities of the other groups are the closest thing to commanders in a movement largely characterized by the absence of readily identifiable leaders.
  ''It would be dangerous to talk to each other,'' he said. ''If one gets caught, all of us get caught.''
  So far, the police have arrested around 2,700 people, though most have been released on bail. About 200 could face 10 years in prison on charges of rioting. Roughly a third of them are under 18, and 100 of them are under 16.
  Many of Fat Boy's claims could not be independently verified, but his mother and the three front-liners on his team corroborated much of what he said.
  He has named his team Hogwarts, after the mythical school of wizardry in the Harry Potter series, and says his group was one of the first to use Molotov cocktails, a weapon that was quickly embraced by other front-line protesters as a way to slow the advance of the riot police.
  His team has been especially busy this fall. On Sept. 29, two days before National Day celebrations in China, several team members set fire to a subway station entrance, producing huge plumes of black smoke and drawing a battalion of firefighters.
  On Oct. 1, they donned Guy Fawkes masks, burned paper portraits of China's president, Xi Jinping, near military barracks and quickly vanished.
  At first glance, Fat Boy is hardly menacing. He shuffles around his mother's luxury apartment in slippers, toggling between cable news channels and video games like Red Dead Redemption. He rarely sleeps more than a few hours each night.
  ''I'm mentally and physically exhausted,'' he said. ''I think the police are tired too.''
  As he spoke, Fat Boy's mother cleaned up the apartment while Jeff and Kitty cuddled on the sofa -- their romance began at a protest this summer.
  Fat Boy's mother was once largely apolitical but now attends the protests, handing out food and tending to those overcome by pepper spray or tear gas.
  ''Every time he goes out, I worry he and his friends will get hurt, or that they might not come home at all,'' she said, wringing her hands.
  Fat Boy said that his schooling influenced his political awakening. He attended an elite Hong Kong academy that he described as pro-China. It sent him and his classmates to the mainland for a week of military training, where he learned the value of leadership and how to fire a gun.
  He later went to school in Canada, where he gained an appreciation for Western-style democracy and civil liberties. He is also well versed in military history and especially World War II, which he says taught him the importance of standing up to tyranny.
  Fat Boy's evolution from peaceful demonstrator to firebomb-throwing provocateur mirrors that of other combative protesters.
  On June 9, he joined a million people who took to the streets in the very first protest against a contentious bill that would have allowed residents to be extradited to mainland China. Fat Boy and many others were infuriated after the city's leader, Carrie Lam, said the  legislation would proceed as planned, driving home the idea that peaceful demonstrations were useless.
  Three days later, on June 12, he joined thousands of protesters in surrounding the legislative complex to block debate about the bill. A core group lobbed umbrellas and bricks at the police, who responded with what critics say was excessive force, beating protesters with batons and dousing them with pepper spray and plumes of tear gas.
  ''On June 9, I was just a guy passing out fliers on the street. By June 12, I had 100 people at my side,'' he said, referring to the confrontational core of protesters.
  To prevent infiltration by undercover officers, Fat Boy scrutinizes the social media accounts of new recruits. So far, he said, only five or six of his members have been arrested, all of them during street fights with the police.
  Their support network includes Hong Kongers in Canada, Australia and Britain who help coordinate attacks on the police, he said. Studying protester chat groups and the live feeds from videographers on the ground, these remote tacticians can direct the front-liners -- and help guide their retreat.
  As he spoke, the rest of the crew was entranced by a particularly graphic video game that Fat Boy was playing on a large-screen TV. His mother winced as a Wild West gunslinger lassoed a man and dragged him to his death.
  ''It's so realistic,'' she said.
  Fat Boy seemed to appreciate the moment's irony and briefly put down the controls.
  ''Now it's like we are playing a video game on the street,'' he said with a sigh. ''Except it's real, and it's not fun.''"

Instagram-ready works of art and graphic design — sometimes whimsical, mostly anonymous — are defining features of the city’s antigovernment demonstrations.
HONG KONG — Soon after a woman in Hong Kong was hit in the eye at a protest, her likeness began circulating as a meme on internet forums where many demonstrators blamed her injury on the police. Within a couple of weeks, protesters had raised over $25,000 online to build a 13-foot statue of her.

Some protest artworks depict the movement’s heroes — including Lady Liberty Hong Kong and a demonstrator in a yellow raincoat who fell from a building in June — in somber, reverential terms. Others are whimsical sendups of Chinese officials, including Carrie Lam, the city’s embattled leader.
These pop art-style posters of Mrs. Lam, below, were designed to be stepped on as pedestrians cross a bridge leading to a train station in the city’s Tsing Yi district.
The poster below, on a wall in the Ma On Shan district in northeastern Hong Kong, seems to liken front line protesters to the protagonists of a battle scene in a Renaissance oil painting.

The poster illustrates a popular, if unproven, sentiment in the antigovernment camp: that while Mrs. Lam has presented herself publicly as empathetic, she has privately encouraged police violence against demonstrators.

The New York Times ,2019-11-29,Hong Kong Police End 2-Week Campus Siege,834 ,"
The police found no protesters during a final search of Polytechnic University, the site of some of the most violent clashes the city has seen this year.
HONG KONG — The police returned control of Hong Kong Polytechnic University’s campus to school officials on Friday, bringing to an end one of the most intense periods of conflict since protests began to engulf the city earlier this year. 
The police, who arrested hundreds of people during their two-week siege of the campus, said they found no protesters there during a final search on Friday morning. Investigators found nearly 4,000 firebombs on the campus over the past two days, as well as other explosive items and bottles of corrosive liquids, the police said.
The siege, which was punctuated by , ended quietly as university officials resumed control of the shattered campus on the southeastern side of the Kowloon Peninsula.
There will not be “any ceremony or event to shake hands or stuff like that,” Chow Yat-ming, an assistant police commissioner, said Friday morning before officers left the campus.
The protests began in June over legislation, since withdrawn, that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China. It has continued over other issues, including calls for expanded elections and an investigation into the police’s use of force.
Hong Kong universities became the centers of especially large protests this month after the death of a student, Chow Tsz-lok, who .
The Chinese University of Hong Kong was , and several other schools saw large demonstrations. Many campuses cut their semesters short because of the unrest.
At Polytechnic University, students who took up their protest there on Nov. 11 were later joined by militant demonstrators who were determined to keep the police out, . On Nov. 17, the             against the demonstrators and warned that those caught could be charged with rioting, which can carry a lengthy prison sentence.
Protesters also set fire to tollbooths near the campus, leading to the two-week closure of a major tunnel linking the Kowloon Peninsula with Hong Kong Island.
Polytechnic University and the streets around it saw large-scale clashes between riot police officers and protesters who were trying to help others flee the besieged campus. The police fired more than 1,400 tear gas rounds on Nov. 18 alone, as large numbers of protesters tried to break through the police cordon around the school.
Protesters hurled bricks and firebombs at the police, and at one point an armored police vehicle was engulfed in flames. One officer was hit in the leg with an arrow.
Some protesters managed to escape the campus by jumping fences when the police were not watching. In one dramatic moment, a few rappelled onto a roadway and were taken away by people on motorcycles. Others tried but failed to escape through sewers.
“I felt anxious and powerless back then, because some of my friends were stuck inside and I didn’t how I could help those detained there,” Ernest Ho, a 24-year-old student at City University of Hong Kong, said Friday. “We also didn’t know what would happen inside, as we couldn’t contact them very easily. 
“I felt depressed when they tried to escape,” he said. “They fled as if they were refugees. However, they are Hong Kong people.”
University officials said Friday that the campus was still unsafe, despite the removal of dangerous materials, and that it would remain closed until further notice.
A police spokesman, Kwok Ka-chuen, said 1,377 people had been arrested during the siege of the campus. Citywide, more than 5,800 people have been arrested in connection with the protests since early June, according to the police.
The protests quieted dramatically in the days before Sunday, when elections were held for district councils across the city. , which had been seen as a referendum on the protest movement, taking 87 percent of the seats. 
On Wednesday,  that authorized sanctions on officials deemed responsible for human rights violations in Hong Kong. Demonstrators in Hong Kong celebrated that legislation with a peaceful gathering Thursday night.
In the Central district, where in recent weeks office workers and others have held lunch-hour demonstrations in support of the protest movement, hundreds of people gathered around midday Friday and spilled onto the roads. Police officers fired pepper spray and arrested one man, the public broadcaster RTHK reported.

The United States, viewed as a champion of democracy, occupies a symbolic role in the protests. Activists now want President Trump to take a tougher stand against Beijing.
HONG KONG — The  at times seem like love fests with the United States. Depending on the day, demonstrators wave American flags or            , and even dress as            , complete with shield.
The United States represents democracy, and the  hope that maybe, just maybe, it will save            . Five months in, they are trying harder than ever to draw the United States into their movement.
are pressing Hong Kong officials and their overseers, the authoritarian Communist Party leaders of China, for greater democratic rights and rule-of-law in the autonomous territory. As they see it, the Trump administration might be able to make demands of Chinese leaders or Hong Kong officials, especially because members of elite political circles want to maintain access to the United States.
Also, they note,  with China, started by President Trump, is adding pressure over all on President Xi Jinping. 
For the American government, the protests are more complicated — a potential policy dilemma but also a potential point of leverage with Beijing and a way to channel American values to the rest of the world. 
“The United States should continue to deter Beijing from use of force, maintain an unblinking eye on Hong Kong, and make Beijing pay a heavy reputational cost for curtailing the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong citizens,” said , a former State Department and National Security Council official now at the Brookings Institution.
Yet, he added, “I worry that the  risk misinterpreting American sympathy and support of their cause for expectation that the United States will shield them from Beijing’s heavy hand.” 
If the protesters are sending out a siren song, some American officials and lawmakers are answering it, eager to show their commitment to the cause.
Members of Congress have appeared in Hong Kong in public displays of solidarity. Last month, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, donned an  outfit, while Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri,             photographs from a protest. 
In Washington, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House,  with activists, pro-democracy politicians and Jimmy Lai, a publisher considered radioactive by Beijing. Vice President Mike Pence singled out Hong Kong as a beacon of liberty in a            , saying, “We stand with you; we are inspired by you.” 
And versions of a bill that would give support to the protesters are  with bipartisan backing. The legislation, among other things, would allow the United States to impose economic sanctions and a travel ban on Hong Kong officials deemed responsible for human rights abuses.
“We hope this bill will pass,” said Selina Po, a 27-year-old protester wearing a mouth mask in the Admiralty neighborhood as she held up a sign with the bill’s name, the . “It’s our hope for winning this war. We’re trying all we can.”
But American officials say the United States needs to weigh its moves carefully. 
Greater involvement by Americans could give Beijing more ammunition in its  to portray the pro-democracy movement as one stoked by foreign forces. 
The  and state-run news organizations talk about “black hands” behind the unrest and spread conspiracy theories, including one centered on an             who was photographed with activists in the lobby of the JW Marriott Hotel. 
As the protests persist, American officials are watching for surges in violence and tracking the . Some are beseeching demonstrators to stick to nonviolent tactics, even in the face of police crackdowns and attacks by people sympathetic to Beijing. 
On Sunday, at least six people were injured when a man with a knife who is believed to be against the democracy movement attacked a family at a shopping mall. In the melee, the attacker bit off part of the ear of a pro-democracy district council member, Andrew Chiu.
“We’re telling everyone that we interact with, we don’t want violence,” . “We think there should be a political solution to the conflict that’s taking place there.”
Two Democratic Congressmen, Tom Suozzi of New York and John Lewis of Georgia, the icon of the American civil rights movement,  last month praising the activists for their “great work” and urging them to stick to nonviolence.
Whether the United States takes greater action on Hong Kong hinges on the unpredictable Mr. Trump. Administration officials and American lawmakers talk openly about . But the president rarely, if ever, mentions human rights and democracy, and he             on Hong Kong. 
He is a transactional president. In June, he told Mr. Xi on  that he would             as long as Washington and Beijing were making progress on trade talks, according to an American official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
In October, the Trump administration  on Chinese companies and organizations for their roles in the mass repression of Muslims in mainland China, but Mr. Trump has             for fear of upsetting the trade negotiations.
If a Hong Kong bill reaches Mr. Trump’s desk, analysts say, the president might see it as merely a tool to wring concessions from China and could forego support if a were close.
“Strong American bipartisan support for the peaceful protesters is not enough to override President Trump’s transactional instincts,” Mr. Hass said. “He does not look at Hong Kong through a values-based lens. And as long as he remains president, this outlook will limit America’s responses to developments in Hong Kong.”
Administration officials argue that Mr. Trump’s approach gives the United States a stronger hand in constraining Beijing on Hong Kong — even if it appears that Mr. Trump just wants to use the Chinese territory to his advantage.
“America expects Beijing to honor its commitments,” Mr. Pence said, “and President Trump has repeatedly made it clear it would be much harder for us to make a trade deal if the authorities resort to the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong.”
In the eyes of Beijing, there has been no shortage of provocations by American politicians. On Oct. 22, Ms. Pelosi  a photograph of herself on Capitol Hill with three pro-democracy figures — Mr. Lai, Martin Lee and Janet Pang.
“My full support and admiration goes to those who have taken to the streets week after week in nonviolent protest to fight for democracy and the rule of law in #HongKong,” she wrote.
On Wednesday, Ms Pelosi slammed the decision by Hong Kong officials to  from running in local elections. She said it was “another blow against rule of law in Hong Kong and the principle of ‘one country, two systems,’” referring to the foundation for the             that Britain and China agreed would be used to govern the territory. 
Ms. Pelosi met Mr. Wong in Washington in September.
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, lashed out, saying, “It is precisely because of the naked cover-up and connivance of external forces such as Pelosi that the violent anti-law forces are even more fearless.”
“No matter how your eyes are blinded by prejudice, no matter how your heart is filled with evil, Hong Kong is China’s Hong Kong,” the spokeswoman added. “Any attempt to interfere in Hong Kong affairs will not succeed.”
Many demonstrators want American intervention and are focusing their attention on the legislation. The mere threat of American sanctions, they say, would give the movement greater voice with Beijing.
On Oct. 14, the night before a vote on the bill in the House of Representatives, protesters  in the Central district to call for its passage. Tens of thousands attended, many of them carrying American flags.
“The power of Hong Kong people alone is limited, and we need other countries, such as the U.S., to help us counter China and keep ‘one country, two systems,’” said Eric Kwan, 32. “I doubt the act can be an ultimate game-changer, but I think it is enough to give pressure to China.” 
Along with allowing for sanctions, the legislation requires the State Department to review each year whether Hong Kong is still autonomous enough to qualify for the benefits of the , which grants the city a trade and economic status different from that of mainland China.
Some American officials say the bill could harm Hong Kong residents if the United States determines that the territory no longer qualifies as an autonomous entity. But the bill’s proponents defend its practical and symbolic value.
“Standing in support of Hong Kongers and preserving Hong Kong’s autonomy should be a priority of the United States and democracies worldwide,” said one of the bill’s sponsors, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida.
The bill  last month. Though the Senate majority leader,            , has not scheduled a vote yet, the measure is expected to pass that chamber easily, with a veto-proof majority. Then Mr. Trump would have to decide whether to sign it into law.

The New York Times,2019-11-01,"Amid Unrest, Hong Kong Falls Into Recession",1127 ,"
The Chinese territory's economy shrank sharply in recent months, officials said on a day when the traditional wearing of masks became especially provocative.
HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's economy officially fell into recession in the third quarter after enduring nearly five months of protests and a persistent trade war between the United States and China.  
  The economy dropped by 3.2 percent in the three months ending in September compared with the quarter that ended in June, Hong Kong officials said on Thursday. It was the worst economic performance for the city since the global financial crisis a decade ago and the strongest signal yet of the damage caused by political unrest.
  ''The blow to Hong Kong economy is multifaceted,'' Paul Chan, the city's financial secretary, wrote in a blog post. He said that a full year contraction was also ''very likely.''
  The performance marked the second consecutive quarter that the territory's economy shrank, meeting the formal definition of a recession. In the quarter that ended in June, the economy contracted 0.4 percent from the first three months of the year.
  Weekends in Hong Kong are now punctuated with public transport shutdowns, road blockages and the early closure of the malls and the luxury stores that were once part of the engine that keeps the city humming.
  Tourists that traveled to Hong Kong from mainland China to fill their empty suitcases are almost all gone. During China's main holiday week in early October, visitors plummeted by 55 percent from the year before. 
  Hong Kong's growth has also been buffeted by a protracted trade war between China and the United States and is part of a broader global economic slowdown that has raised fears of recession in other major economies, including Germany and Britain.
  In a vague but potentially far-reaching proposal, the Chinese Communist Party announced Thursday that it would roll out new steps to ''safeguard national security'' in Hong Kong. Details may emerge in the weeks ahead, but the protests continued on Thursday, with demonstrators using Hong Kong's Halloween demonstrations to challenge a recent ban on masks at public gatherings. 
  Early on Thursday evening, the mood in Lan Kwai Fong, a rowdy night life district known for its booze-soaked Halloween parties, was noticeably muted. While the streets were still filled with revelers in costumes, compared to years past there were fewer Halloween decorations and more security and journalists.
  At around 7 p.m., dozens of protesters wearing masks of government leaders like Xi Jinping and Carrie Lam gathered in the district. Amid blaring music from nearby bars, the protesters began shouting slogans like ''Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.''
  Not long after, a tense standoff formed between the police and protesters. Officers soon declared the gathering an unlawful assembly and took the nearly unprecedented step of ordering an immediate evacuation of the district. 
  Later in the evening, with the area blocked off, a reveler dressed as Snow White could be seen coughing in the tear gas as tourists took selfies.
  The night included multiple clashes between protesters and police elsewhere around the city. The police fired canisters of tear gas at protesters outside the Mong Kok police station in the Prince Edward district, and later in the heart of the central business district, which includes Lan Kwai Fong.
  The protest movement began as a fight over a now-withdrawn extradition bill and has expanded its demands to include free elections and an independent investigation into the police's use of force. But after agreeing to withdraw the extradition bill, the government has since then refused to budge on the other demands, summed up by protesters under the slogan ''five demands, not one less.''
  Under mounting pressure to take action, Hong Kong's embattled leader, Carrie Lam, drew on a colonial-era law to ban face masks at public gatherings. The move set off some of the most violent protests since the movement began in June. Pan-democratic lawmakers say the ban is unconstitutional since it was introduced without going through the normal legislative process. On Thursday, the High Court began a two-day hearing to review the lawmakers' requests to overturn the emergency law.
  Dozens of protesters have since been arrested on charges of violating the prohibition. But enforcement has been uneven. Face masks have long been a common accessory in Hong Kong, particularly since a deadly SARS outbreak in the city in 2003, and there has also been confusion about what constitutes a public gathering. The ambiguity has provided cover for some protesters to defy the ban.
  Leading up to Halloween night, preparations were being made in anticipation of clashes. In a statement on Tuesday, the police warned of possible road closures and urged shops to close early if necessary. In a video released on Thursday afternoon, a police spokesman sought to pre-empt criticism by stating that officers were empowered to use force to remove facial coverings, if necessary.
  Ocean Park, the city's largest theme park, announced on Wednesday that it was canceling the last day of its signature seasonal event, Halloween Fest, citing the ''current social situation.'' The MTR Corporation, the Hong Kong subway operator, also announced that it was shutting train service down early, ostensibly to deter protesters from taking to the streets. 
  Prince Edward Station, near one of the busiest shopping districts on the Kowloon Peninsula, was shut down the earliest, at 2 p.m., apparently in response to calls among protesters to gather Thursday at the station, the site of a particularly violent confrontation between police and protesters exactly two months ago. Protesters are still angry about that night after video footage showed riot officers charging into a waiting subway carriage and beating people with batons and dousing them with pepper spray.
  The announcement on Thursday about the city's recession came as no surprise to bar employees in Lan Kwai Fong, which has seen business plummet in recent months.
  ''The locals are pretty terrified of coming out, the mainlanders used to give us a lot of business but they're not here anymore, and the tourists aren't showing up anymore either,'' said Paul Pecas, a bartender at a bar in Lan Kwai Fong bar called Tipsy Bird.
  Mr. Pecas said that business at the bar had dropped by 50 percent this month compared to last October, which is typically the peak month for customers. Two of Tipsy Bird's sister bars, he said, had been shut down in recent months because of the protests.
  ''I have nothing against anyone,'' said Mr. Pecas. ''I'm just terrified of losing my job.''

The New York Times ,2019-07-27,Clashes and Tear Gas as Hong Kong Police Confront Protesters in Yuen Long,1258 ,"
HONG KONG — After firing multiple rounds of tear gas, riot police officers on Saturday briefly clashed with protesters inside the same Hong Kong train station where an armed mob had attacked demonstrators last weekend.
Tens of thousands of protesters had converged on the northern district of Yuen Long to show their opposition to , armed with sticks and metal bars, on demonstrators and others there last Sunday night that had left at least 45 people injured.
What started out as a peaceful rally descended into brief clashes and chaos at the train station where last week’s attack had taken place. After getting the protesters off the streets with round after round of tear gas, the riot police stormed the train station where protesters had retreated, and brief clashes ensued before the officers backed away.
[“We need to resist.” Supporters and protestors .] 
The Hong Kong police had taken the rare step of formally objecting to the Saturday protest, citing concerns about possible violence in their rejection of the applications to hold it. In a statement early Sunday, the government condemned the protesters “for breaching the public peace and breaking the law deliberately.” It said the police would take serious action against protesters who had engaged in violence.
The government said earlier that 17 people were hurt, including 10 who were hospitalized, with two in serious condition. In a statement early Sunday, the police said 11 men had been arrested on charges including unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapons, assaulting a police officer and assault. They said at least four officers were injured.
The wave of protests sweeping Hong Kong began in early June and has targeted draft legislation, since shelved, that would have allowed . The demands have since grown to include broader democracy and an independent investigation into accusations that the police used excessive force against demonstrators.
“Hong Kong people have to unite and stand up for Hong Kong,” said Rita Tang, a 56-year-old health consultant who joined Saturday’s protest in Yuen Long. “We have neglected our rights. We must fight for our future generation for their rights that they deserve.”
Protesters started filling the main street of Yuen Long in the afternoon and marched peacefully for about two hours.
“We have come here because we still support all the actions of the people here today,” said Cary Lo, a 37-year-old compliance officer and community officer for the Democratic Party of Hong Kong. He held a yellow umbrella, a symbol of the pro-democracy protest movement.
But the police began to push the back after a group occupied a road on the edge of the town center, surrounding a police van, smashing a window and covering it with graffiti.
For several hours in the afternoon, as protesters tried to advance toward a police line, riot officers fired round after round of tear gas at them, forcing them back. A leading pro-democracy lawmaker, Roy Kwong, said the tear gas was being fired near a home for older people.
“It’s an elderly home,” he shouted at the police. “If an elderly person dies, you need to be responsible.”
The protesters dragged steel barricades and pulled down metal fences to assemble makeshift roadblocks as they tried to get closer to a low-rise village where gang members were thought to have fled after last Sunday’s mob attack. Riot police officers drove them back with tear gas.
Across the masses of demonstrators, a chorus of banging could be heard as the crowd used sticks and umbrellas to strike road dividers and other metallic surfaces. The police said some demonstrators were throwing bricks and other hard objects at officers.
Most businesses along the protest route and in Yuen Long’s otherwise bustling malls shut down as the demonstrators marched through the area. Many protesters gathered around the town’s police station, throwing “ghost money” — a type of fake money usually meant for the dead — at the building.
The Hong Kong police have been criticized for their slow response to the mob attack on Sunday, and for not detaining anyone in Yuen Long that night. They have since arrested 12 men in connection with the attack, including some accused of having connections with .
Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, the No. 2 official in Hong Kong, apologized on Friday for the police response.
But in an unusually public sign of divisions between the police and the government, some officers posted images online late Friday saying that Mr. Cheung did not speak for them, and that his words undermined their work. A letter from the Junior Police Officers’ Association “severely condemned” Mr. Cheung’s comments.
The authorities had warned that a march in Yuen Long would threaten public security and risk clashes between protesters and residents. To skirt the police ban on the event, some protesters suggested alternative reasons for going to Yuen Long: shopping, jogging, playing Pokemon Go or even, most sarcastically, holding a memorial for Li Peng, the  who was loathed by many for his role in crushing the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.
Among those attending the protest was Leonard Cheng, the president of Lingnan University, who said he wanted “to know and understand the situation because many students are here.” He warned students away from violence, saying, “Please run if you see danger.”
Yuen Long, which sits near fish and shrimp farms , has both old villages and urban new towns, which were built in the 1970s and ’80s to handle Hong Kong’s population growth. For many years, dating back to when Hong Kong was a British colony, the authorities have trodden carefully with the village residents.
Descendants of people who lived in the villages in the late 19th century, when Britain took over the area, are still given special land rights and representation in elected bodies — privileges seen as unfair by many in the wider population.
Eddie Chu, a pro-democracy lawmaker, warned protesters this week to avoid villages, graves and ancestral halls in the area. Any such incursion, , would help            , a pro-establishment politician from the area. Mr. Ho was seen with men in white T-shirts on the night of the train station attack, and he later said that Yuen Long needed to be defended from protesters. Soon after the attack, the graves of Mr. Ho’s parents were vandalized.
Earlier this past week, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of National Defense said the military, which has several thousand troops based in Hong Kong, . Hong Kong officials have had the right to ask for military intervention ever since the territory was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, but they have repeatedly said that they have no plans to take such a drastic step.

The New York Times ,2019-08-18,Hong Kong Protesters Defy Police Ban in Show of Strength After Tumult,1534 ,"
HONG KONG — A sea of Hong Kong protesters marched through the dense city center in the pouring rain on Sunday, defying a police ban, in a vivid display of the movement’s continuing strength after more than two months of demonstrations, days of ugly violence and increasingly vehement warnings from the Chinese government.
People began assembling in the early afternoon in Victoria Park, the starting point of huge  that were             of protesters. The police approved the Sunday rally but objected to plans to march to the Central district, citing clashes that had occurred after previous events. But protesters marched anyway.
By midafternoon, the park had filled with tens of thousands of people, and the demonstrators began to spill into nearby roads. Protesters holding signs jammed a multilane main road in the Causeway Bay shopping district, stopping traffic and forcing trams to slow to a crawl. The crowd inched toward the park amid heavy rain, shouting, “People of Hong Kong, keep fighting.”
Organizers estimated at least 1.7 million people had turned out — nearly one in four of the total population of more than seven million — making it the second-largest march of the movement, after a protest by nearly two million on June 16.
The Hong Kong police released a far lower crowd estimate, saying there were 128,000 protesters in Victoria Park during the peak period.
But when the march reached the government headquarters in the Admiralty district, the line of people behind stretched nearly two miles, with large crowds still waiting to leave the park.
“I came here for the future of Hong Kong and the next generation of Hong Kong. The government has not responded to our demands,” said Amy Bau, 41, a sign language teacher. “I have come out to march many times, and I will keep coming out if the government continues to not answer us.”
Joyce Man, a 26-year-old clerk, said she had joined despite her worries about the military being called upon to quell protests.
“I still think my showing up is my responsibility,” she said. “The more people in the street today, the safer Hong Kong people are. There’s strength when people unite.”
Roads and sidewalks across Hong Kong Island were filled with people on the march or trying to make their way to the start. Many subway trains skipped stops near the start, citing the large crowds, and traffic was snarled across many neighborhoods.
The march was peaceful throughout the day, following several days of relative quiet and no use of tear gas by the police over the weekend.
Lawrence and Season Lee were marching on a highway with their 3-year-old daughter, who tottered along in pink galoshes. Mr. Lee said he knew that violence was always a possibility with the protests, but he felt Sunday’s march was too important to miss.
“We can’t take it anymore,” he said. “The government hasn’t given any response.”
It was especially important, the Lees said, that their daughter come along to see what was happening.
“We tell her we are all doing this for your future,” Mrs. Lee said.
When the march forced Chan Hok-man, a 31-year-old bus driver, to stop, he changed the digital display at the front of his bus to read “Merry Christmas.” It was a small way, he said, to show his support.
Sunday’s march shows the movement is still strong, he said.
“Just look around!” he said. “You see these people, and you can see what they are saying. What do you think?”
The turnout was being closely watched as a gauge of public sentiment after several tumultuous days. One week ago, riot police officers fired tear gas in one subway station and chased protesters down an escalator in another. At the Hong Kong airport, days of sit-ins swelled to fill the main terminal, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights.
The situation at the airport took a violent turn on Tuesday when protesters , including one identified as a state media journalist, binding them and hitting them. That abuse provoked widespread condemnation from China and            .
In recent days, the protests have quieted somewhat. The airport limited terminal access to passengers, halting demonstrations there. On Saturday, when protests were held at several places across the city,  who had surrounded a station, but did not fire tear gas. The authorities later said a police officer had fired a bean bag round at a person who had thrown a trash can and other items at a police vehicle in the Mong Kok district.
Entering the weekend, the repeated call among protesters was to prepare to rally on Sunday.
The protests began in June over a Hong Kong government proposal that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. That legislation has been shelved, though not completely withdrawn, and the demands of the protesters have grown to include expanded direct elections and amnesty for arrested protesters. Many protesters have complained about the use of force by the police and have accused the authorities of not aggressively investigating thugs who have attacked demonstrators.
“This protest started because we didn’t agree with a government policy, but as time went on we discovered many bad things about the police and the criminals and other things that make us want to speak up,” said Paul Lam, 25.
The Civil Human Rights Front, the group that organized the gathering, issued a long statement criticizing what it called “Chinese-style repression” by the Hong Kong police, and called for top officers to step down.
“Today’s assembly continues the will of the two million people who marched on June 16 against brutality,” it said. “We want to gather the most Hong Kongers, and, using peaceful, rational and nonviolent means, unite in spirit and action to express our indignation against police brutality, as well as display Hong Kongers’ firm resolve.”
The Hong Kong government responded that over the past two months the police had faced protesters who blocked roads, vandalized public facilities, set fires and attacked officers with gasoline bombs and bricks.
“The police have been handling these illegal acts with tolerance,” the government said in a statement. “Only when they were violently attacked and left with no choice did the police use minimum force to disperse protesters in order to restore social order.”
The Chinese government has criticized the protests in strong terms, calling the airport violence “close to terrorism” and warning that the military could be called in. Paramilitary police officers have gathered for drills in the nearby city of Shenzhen, and a  showed hundreds of riot police officers with shields and batons charging at men dressed in black.
Ivan Choy, a senior lecturer in the department of government and public administration at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the large turnout showed the criticism from mainland officials and the displays of force had had little effect.
“The harsh lines and tough political positions of Chinese officials have not helped stop the movement,” he said. “People keep coming out to express their grievances with the Hong Kong government and police.”
In cities around the world, including ,            , Sydney, Melbourne and New York, protesters took to the streets on Saturday to show support for the planned demonstration in Hong Kong. One activist and organizer in New York estimated that at least 40 cities had planned similar rallies.
In Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city,  between Hong Kong protesters and pro-Beijing groups. And in Sydney, supporters of the Chinese government             and shouted profanities at a handful of counterprotesters.
In New York, hundreds of people dressed in black, including Alvin Yeung, a Hong Kong lawmaker, and Nathan Law, a prominent Hong Kong activist, gathered in Chinatown for a rally and then snaked over the Manhattan Bridge.
At one point, demonstrators put their hands over their right eyes to show support for a woman in Hong Kong who was hit in the eye with a projectile during clashes with the police. Across the street, a smaller group of pro-China protesters waved flags and chanted nationalist slogans.
Mr. Yeung, a vocal critic of the Hong Kong government, said it was important for people around the world to support the Hong Kong protesters. “Hope is the only thing we have,” he said.

The New York Times ,2019-08-08,What_s Happening in Hong Kong _,1265 ,"
The demonstrations in Hong Kong have evolved, characterized by changing tactics and goals — and more frequent violence. Here’s a guide. 
HONG KONG — The protests that have shaken  this summer began with huge demonstrations in early June against an unpopular bill. Since then, they have become a broader movement against Beijing’s power in the semiautonomous territory.
Over several months, violent clashes between young protesters and the police have become more frequent, and the demonstrators’ demands have gotten more diverse and ambitious. Activists have stormed government offices,  and defaced symbols of Beijing’s authority. And the use of force against demonstrators, along with the failure to prevent a mob attack on train passengers, has made police conduct a central issue. During the protests of Oct. 1, which coincided with celebrations marking the 70th year of Communist rule in China,            . It was the first time in months of protests that a live round was fired at a            .
On Sept. 4,  chief executive said she would satisfy one of the protesters’ central demands by            . But it may not be enough to appease the protesters, who are now driven by multiple grievances with the government.
[Read more about what’s happening in the .]
Here’s a guide to what prompted the protests, how they evolved and why it all matters.
What is Hong Kong’s relationship with China? 
Hong Kong, an international finance hub on China’s southern coast, was a British colony until 1997, when it was handed back to China under a policy known as “.” 
The policy made Hong Kong part of China but let it keep many liberties denied to citizens on the mainland, including free speech, unrestricted internet access and the right to free assembly. The territory has its own laws, system of government and police force under a mini-constitution known as the Basic Law. China promised that this system would remain in place until at least 2047.
But many Hong Kongers feel that Beijing is already , and that the local government does its bidding. The territory’s top leader, the chief executive — currently Carrie Lam — is appointed by a pro-Beijing committee. And China’s security apparatus has made troubling intrusions into Hong Kong territory, including             and a Chinese-born            .
Why did people start protesting?
In February, the local government introduced a bill in Hong Kong’s legislature, which is stacked with pro-China lawmakers, that would allow people accused of crimes to be sent to places with which Hong Kong had no extradition treaty — , where the courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
Mrs. Lam, the chief executive, argued that the bill was needed to guarantee justice for victims. She said it was prompted by the case of a man who was , then evading prosecution by fleeing to Hong Kong. Critics say the bill would allow Beijing to target dissidents in Hong Kong with phony charges. "
The New York Times,2019-10-02,Anger Grows in Hong Kong Over Shooting of Teenage Protester,697 ,"
HONG KONG -- Raw anger was building in Hong Kong on Wednesday over the shooting of a teenage demonstrator a day earlier, the first such incident since antigovernment demonstrations began in the territory nearly four months ago.
The shooting of the teenager came on a day of intense clashes across Hong Kong between protesters and the police, and hours after China's top leader, Xi Jinping, presided over a carefully choreographed military parade in Beijing to celebrate 70 years of Communist rule. 
  The question now is whether the shooting will further incite a protest movement that was already seething with grievances, and which has been driven by young people who see the city's pro-Beijing leaders as illegitimate.
  In an early sign of anger over the shooting, a Wednesday morning meeting between administrators at the teenager's high school and more than 100 of its alumni quickly devolved into a bitter confrontation. Many of the former students cried, shouted questions and asked why the administrators had not condemned the police officer who shot the student.
  ''Can you see how many people are crying here?'' one woman pleaded.
  But others suggested the school take action against the student for his conduct in the protests, including Leung Chun-ying, Hong Kong's former chief executive.
  The Hong Kong Police Force said on Tuesday evening that the protester was an 18-year-old who had been shot in the left shoulder, and that he was conscious as he was taken to the hospital for surgery.
  In a video circulating online that appears to show the shooting, the protester is first seen joining a mob of black-clad people who chase a riot officer and tackle him to the ground. They kick him and beat him with what appear to be pipes.
  A few seconds later, the protester approaches a second police officer who is nearby with a handgun drawn. Just after the protester hits the officer with the pole, the officer fires at the man at point-blank range.
  Hours after the shooting, the Hong Kong police commissioner, Stephen Lo, said the officer who shot the protester had acted in a ''legal and reasonable'' manner, having given a verbal warning before opening fire.
  The officer had been assaulted at close quarters, Mr. Lo said, and had no other choice but to shoot. ''The range was not determined by the police officer, but by the perpetrator,'' he said.
  But the Hong Kong Public Doctors' Association, which represents doctors working in public hospitals and medical departments at the University of Hong Kong, condemned the officer on Tuesday for not using a less powerful weapon, such as a rifle that shoots beanbag rounds, to subdue the protester.
  In a statement on Wednesday morning, the protester's high school, Tsuen Wan Public Ho Chuen Yiu Memorial College, said that faculty members and the student body ''all feel very sad and worried'' about the shooting. The school's administration had opened a crisis management unit that includes psychologists and social workers to help students cope, the statement said.
  Mr. Lo, the police commissioner, told reporters at an overnight news conference that the police had arrested the protester who was shot, but that the force would decide later whether to press charges. At the meeting with the alumni on Wednesday, the school's principal and vice principal said that the student would not be punished and would keep his place in the school.
  The principal, Tse Yun Ming, lowered his gaze as he absorbed an onslaught of criticism from the former students.
  ''My emotions are also fluctuating,'' he told them at one point.
  But Mr. Leung, the city's former chief executive, criticized the student's conduct. ''Could you not directly denounce his wrongdoing,'' he asked in a Facebook post, suggesting that before being shot the student ''surrounded and beat the police on the streets in full gear along with other rioters.''
  Sit-in protests were expected Wednesday afternoon in at least seven Hong Kong districts, including in Tseun Wan, where the shooting occurred. Tsuen Wan is a working-class district miles from the gleaming skyscrapers of the city's financial district.

The New York Times,2019-08-06,Hong Kong Protesters Back Strike; Authorities Fight Back,1495 ,"
HONG KONG -- Antigovernment protesters in Hong Kong mounted their fiercest challenge to the authorities on Monday, disrupting more than 200 airline flights, occupying malls and blocking roadways and rail lines to snarl the commute for hundreds of thousands of workers.
The protesters called for a general strike in an effort to halt daily life across the semiautonomous Chinese territory, wielding a potentially powerful new tool in their weekslong campaign against the Hong Kong government. 
  Hong Kong's values of efficiency, hard work and, increasingly, a dedication to public protest are colliding as protesters from across society test the limits of the city's police force. Officers on Monday fired tear gas near shopping malls and residential areas and arrested at least 82 people, while the city's leader warned that efforts to ''topple Hong Kong'' could destroy livelihoods and push the city ''to the verge of a very dangerous situation.''
  Monday was the last of three consecutive days of large-scale civil disobedience intended to increase pressure on the government as it confronts Hong Kong's worst political crisis since 1997, when it was returned to Chinese rule after more than 150 years as a British colony.
  Many protesters said they felt they had no choice but to escalate their actions after the government was unswayed by peaceful marches in June that organizers said drew as many as two million people.
  The protests began nearly two months ago in response to legislation, since suspended, that would allow criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the governing Communist Party. The movement, which has been driven by longstanding fears of deteriorating freedoms under Beijing's rule, has expanded to include a variety of grievances, including the stalled expansion of direct elections and accusations of excessive force by the police.
  It was unclear how many people heeded the call to strike. But protesters began the day by blocking roads and train doors using flash-mob-style tactics, while more than 200 flights at the city's international airport were canceled as large numbers of air traffic controllers called in sick. An estimated 2,300 people in the civil aviation industry participated in the strike, according to the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions.
  Mass rallies were held at more than half a dozen sites, including outside the government headquarters on Hong Kong's main island. Officers fired tear gas at several locations across the city.
  Later in the evening, protesters in the North Point neighborhood on eastern Hong Kong Island were briefly attacked by men wearing white shirts and wielding sticks in a scene reminiscent of July 21, when a pro-Beijing mob beat protesters and bystanders in the satellite town of Yuen Long.
  Since the protests began in early June, the police have arrested 420 people and fired 1,000 rounds of tear gas, a spokesman said Monday.
  That is significantly more than during Hong Kong's last sustained protest movement in 2014, when the use of tear gas against pro-democracy demonstrators galvanized the public in support of a sit-in that lasted 79 days. The police fired a total of 87 tear gas canisters then, and only on that first night.
  In recent weeks, the protesters' anger has largely shifted to focus on the scale and intensity of the police response. On Monday they surrounded and vandalized several police stations, setting fires outside at least two of them. Supporters say the police have regularly shown restraint.
  Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, warned Monday morning in her first public remarks in two weeks that the city ''has become unsafe and unstable'' and that ''a series of extremely violent acts are pushing Hong Kong into very precarious circumstances.''
  Mrs. Lam accused protesters of challenging Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong, citing a slogan some of them chanted that is associated with an imprisoned activist who at one point advocated Hong Kong independence.
  ''They want to topple Hong Kong, to thoroughly destroy the livelihoods that seven million people cherish,'' she said.
  Mrs. Lam is under pressure from China's central government to bring the protests under control, and the Chinese military hinted last month that it could be called in to restore order. The Hong Kong government has repeatedly denied plans to make any such request.
  The response by Hong Kong officials to the strike on Monday ''was a disaster,'' said Antony Dapiran, a Hong Kong-based lawyer and the author of a book about dissent in Hong Kong. ''They came out with a fairly hard line, no concessions, nothing new.''
  Mrs. Lam even faced criticism from establishment lawmakers. She ''raised many questions at the news conference, but where are the solutions?'' Ann Chiang, a lawmaker from Hong Kong's largest pro-Beijing party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, wrote on Facebook. ''Disappointing!!!''
  Mainland Chinese officials responsible for Hong Kong policy are scheduled to hold a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. On Wednesday, they will meet with Hong Kong delegates to the Chinese national congress in Shenzhen, just across the mainland border, the Hong Kong public broadcaster RTHK reported.
  The Hong Kong government also warned Monday that the unrest was affecting the local economy, including sales of luxury goods as mainland visitors choose to avoid the city, a concern that will garner little sympathy from protesters. Hong Kong stocks declined by almost 3 percent on Monday.
  ''The movement has had a lot of impact on Hong Kong, the operation of the whole economy and the operation of many industries and businesses,'' said Ivan Choy, a senior lecturer in government and public administration at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ''But I think this is the right of Hong Kong people to demand more freedom and more justice in society.''
  Some commuters complained about the transportation delays and confronted protesters. Vehicles plowed through barriers set up by protesters along roadways at least twice, sending demonstrators diving for safety. But even those facing delays said the government was to blame for failing to address public grievances.
  ''Carrie Lam has caused my absence today,'' said Dancus Au, 24, an employee at a security company who was stuck in a subway station for hours in the morning.
  He said Mrs. Lam had made a mistake by merely suspending the extradition bill rather than formally withdrawing it, as protesters have demanded.
  ''She should have said 'withdraw' at the beginning of this fiasco,'' he said. ''She is part of the root cause, while Beijing is another part of it.''
  Labor unions said hundreds of thousands may have joined the strike, and some groups, like workers at Hong Kong Disneyland, did announce work stoppages. Others took a day of leave or called in sick to join the protests. After weeks of protests led largely by people in their teens and twenties, the general strike was seen as a way for middle-aged supporters of the movement to participate.
  Janice Lau, a 38-year-old teacher, pumped her fist in the air in encouragement as she and her 6-year-old daughter, Zoe, watched protesters drag steel barricades to block traffic near the government headquarters in the Admiralty district.
  ''I'm proud of them,'' she said. ''Society forced them to do this, and they didn't harm the society. These days, people are more afraid when the police appear than when protesters appear.''
  Some businesses also closed. The Hong Kong Jockey Club, which has a government-granted monopoly on gambling, announced that off-site betting facilities would stop taking wagers by 6 p.m., citing safety concerns. At two luxury malls, Pacific Place in Admiralty and Lee Gardens in Causeway Bay, many shops were closed.
  Chinese state media outlets, which have grown increasingly vocal in their condemnation of the protests, renewed their criticism on Monday.
  The People's Daily, the Communist Party's outlet, criticized protesters who had thrown a Chinese flag into the Hong Kong harbor over the weekend, accusing them of wanting to end the ''one country, two systems'' arrangement that defines the relationship between Hong Kong and Beijing. Mrs. Lam also mentioned the incident in her remarks on Monday.
  Since protesters started to increasingly target police stations this past weekend, officers have appeared to be more aggressive in making arrests. But the increased assertiveness risked further inflaming public sentiment, and at least one protest not originally scheduled for Monday was driven by anger over an earlier arrest.
  ''For me the most alarming thing is we're kind of on a knife's edge here -- open disrespect for the police, police stations being targeted,'' Mr. Dapiran said. ''We are on the cusp of what could be a general breakdown of law and order. It hasn't gotten there yet, but the government hasn't done anything to stop it.''"
The New York Times ,2019-09-22,Two 13-Year-Olds Are Arrested Over Hong Kong Protests,850 ,"
HONG KONG — The Hong Kong police arrested two 13-year-olds on the fringes of antigovernment demonstrations over the weekend, including a girl accused of burning a Chinese national flag, the authorities said on Sunday.
The arrests on Saturday appear to be further signals that the local police are taking an increasingly hard line against the pro-democracy demonstrators who have roiled the city for three and a half months.
Protesters have taken to destroying symbols of Chinese state authority, including flags, in recent months, but the latest arrest comes less than two weeks before Oct. 1, the foremost political holiday in the Chinese calendar and one which Beijing takes pains to ensure is celebrated without incident.
The arrests came amid another weekend of protests across the city, and vandalism at several subway stations and shopping malls. Protesters at a mall in northern Hong Kong stomped on and painted a Chinese flag, and heckled businesses that they perceived to be friendly to Beijing.
The two minors were arrested on Saturday during a in which protesters threw bricks and firebombs and the police fired multiple rounds of tear gas in Yuen Long, a satellite town near Hong Kong’s border with the Chinese mainland.
The police said protesters had at one point on Saturday used “hard objects” to attack an officer who was conducting an arrest and attempted to steal his revolver. Television footage from Yuen Long also showed protesters assaulting at least two unarmed men.
A group of masked protesters was seen burning a Chinese flag in broad daylight on Saturday during a police-approved march through the Tuen Mun district of northwestern Hong Kong, a few miles from Yuen Long. The police later said that a 13-year-old girl had been arrested that night on suspicion of “desecrating the national flag” in Tuen Mun.
She was held in detention overnight and released on bail by Sunday afternoon.
On Sunday, local television news stations broadcast protesters stomping on a Chinese flag and spraying it with black paint before dumping it in a river during a pro-democracy rally at a shopping mall in the Sha Tin neighborhood in northern Hong Kong.
A local  says that people convicted of desecrating the Chinese flag in Hong Kong by “publicly and willfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling on it” face a fine of nearly $6,400 and imprisonment for up to three years.
Under Hong Kong law, children are defined as being under 14 years of age. Those 10 or older can be found guilty of committing crimes, but no one younger than 14 can be sentenced to prison.
The Oct. 1 holiday will commemorate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China under the Communist Party. Beijing does not want anything to mar the occasion, but the protesters plan to do just that. They have called for a day of protests to pressure the local government to meet their demands for political reforms, police accountability and universal suffrage.
The protesters are also venting anger with what they see as the steady erosion of the freedoms that Hong Kongers enjoy under a “” arrangement that has governed the former British colony since its return to Chinese control in 1997.
At a National Day reception on Sunday, Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, pledged that her government would do its best to stop the “continuous violence” that has gripped the city over the past few months.
“As long as everyone is united and strives to become stronger, I believe that with the strong support of the central government, Hong Kong will surely welcome a better tomorrow,” Mrs. Lam said at the reception, which was hosted by the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, a pro-Beijing group.
Also on Sunday, the police said that they had also arrested a 13-year-old boy on Saturday in the Tseung Kwan O neighborhood of eastern Hong Kong. The boy was arrested on suspicion of unlawful assembly and of possessing “instruments fit for unlawful purposes.”
In a statement, the police said the boy had been carrying spray-paint and “laser guns,” the authorities’ term for the laser pens that many protesters have used this summer to annoy officers.
Edith Leung, an officer in one of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy political parties,  on Facebook that she said showed the boy being led away by police. The footage shows police leading away a boy — who wears a white T-shirt black shorts and sneakers — as bystanders shout “Corrupt cops!”
Ryan Ho, 20, a university student who attended a protest in Hong Kong on Sunday, said that in his experience, Hong Kong police officers tend to ""snatch” a disproportionate number of younger people, especially secondary school students, while making arrests at protests.
“It just so happens that they are more vulnerable and less resistant,” he said.

HONG KONG -- The Chinese government and its allies in Hong Kong on Tuesday denounced a group of protesters who had stormed the legislature a day ago, leading a barrage of criticism that gave the city's embattled leader a moment of reprieve.
Dozens of protesters had charged and occupied Hong Kong's legislative office building on Monday, breaking glass walls and spray-painting surfaces with slogans on the politically significant anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China from Britain. 
  On Tuesday, China's leadership sent a strongly worded warning to the semiautonomous region, accusing those protesters of being ''extreme radicals'' who committed an illegal act ''that tramples on the rule of law and jeopardizes social order.''
  The decision by some protesters to resort to destructive tactics has momentarily deflected scrutiny and criticism away from Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, and her handling of a contentious bill that ignited some of the largest demonstrations the region has seen.
  But it also raised questions about the effectiveness and political prospects of Mrs. Lam, who was handpicked by China.
  Mrs. Lam, whom protesters have urged to resign, told her top advisers in a closed-door meeting at her official residence on Tuesday that she intended to serve out her term of office through 2022, said Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker and a member of the Executive Council who was at the meeting.
  But her advisers responded bluntly that she needs to work on her handling of Hong Kong's escalating unrest.
  ''We all advised her to improve her communication strategy,'' Ms. Ip said.
  As protests have rocked the city, Mrs. Lam has said several times that she would work harder at reaching out to groups with different political views, but has yet to do so.
  For weeks, Mrs. Lam has appeared unable to quell swelling anger as citizens voiced their discontent with the political leadership in Hong Kong, a former British colony that was handed back to China in 1997.
  The protests began as opposition to a bill Mrs. Lam was pushing that would allow China to extradite Hong Kong citizens. But they quickly morphed into a broader expression of anxiety over China's encroachment into the region and the erosion of the civil liberties that set it apart from the rest of China.
  While hundreds of thousands of people marched peacefully to demand Mrs. Lam's resignation on Monday, a core group of other, mostly younger, demonstrators stormed the legislature. For hours, the police, who had been accused of excessive force in earlier protests, largely stood by, and they made a surprise retreat once the protesters began to breach an inner door.
  Some questioned why Mrs. Lam did not urge the police to step in sooner.
  ''Why did she let the people get into the Legislative Council?'' said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political scientist at Hong Kong Baptist University. ''In what country is the Parliament not protected by the police?''
  Most leading voices in Hong Kong's pro-Beijing camp, who hold a majority in the legislature, echoed the Chinese government in condemning the violence.
  ''This is an insult to the Legislative Council, and an insult to Hong Kong's rule of law,'' said Starry Lee, a pro-establishment lawmaker of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, who called on the government to investigate and bring charges in order to send a message that ''those who break the law need to be punished.''
  Other pro-Beijing lawmakers, business groups and the Law Society, a typically pro-establishment group of lawyers that had earlier called for the government to delay passage of the contentious bill, added their voices to the criticism against the demonstrators.
  Opposition lawmakers were more sympathetic to the protesters, saying that they had resorted to violence out of desperation over not being heard.
  Surprisingly, a few lawmakers from the pro-Beijing camp said the government ought to accept some blame for the mayhem.
  James Tien, the honorary chairman of the pro-establishment Liberal Party, said that by ordering the police to stand back, the government was deliberately ''letting the students make a fool of themselves.''
  ''That seems like they were encouraging these violent acts,'' he said.
  Some of the city's pro-Beijing business elite who have come to depend on China for their success also began to ask whether it was time to revive discussions about political reform that would address concerns from protesters about their sense of powerlessness in politics.
  ''So many people are complaining about the unfairness of the political arrangement right now,'' said Felix Chung, a lawmaker who represents the textiles and garment sector. Mr. Chung was referring broadly to a system in which Beijing effectively has the most say over who becomes the territory's leader and only half the seats in the legislature are filled by popular elections. ''I don't mind political reform,'' he said.
  Michael Tien, another pro-Beijing lawmaker and retail magnate, went further.
  ''I am pleading for the chief executive to speak to Beijing to introduce constitutional reform,'' he said, referring to a proposal made by Beijing in 2015 to allow residents to elect the chief executive from a slate of candidates approved by a committee under its control.
  ''To me, this is another case of young people getting frustrated and yearning to have their voices heard,'' he said.
  It's unclear if China's president, Xi Jinping, would even entertain such a proposal. The authoritarian leader has emphasized the importance of maintaining the integrity of China's territory and sought to expand Beijing's influence in Hong Kong.
  The mainland Chinese news media, which is tightly controlled by the ruling Communist Party, has provided little reporting on the protests that have roiled Hong Kong for the past several weeks and thrown the city's leadership into a political crisis.
  But on Tuesday, Chinese government's statements criticizing the protests received blanket coverage across major Chinese state media outlets, alongside editorials that blamed hostile Western forces for the unrest. The protesters were portrayed as hooligans motivated by mob violence, with state-run outlets omitting details of their broader political demands.
  ''Out of blind arrogance and rage, protesters showed a complete disregard for law and order,'' said an editorial in the Global Times, a nationalist tabloid.
  By limiting discussion of the protests, the government was obscuring a potential embarrassment to the party and Mr. Xi. The government also might be eager to prevent outbursts of nationalism, which can be seen as a challenge to party's primacy, analysts said.
  ''The party always wants to stay ahead of Chinese nationalism,'' said Dan Lynch, a professor of Asian and international studies at the City University of Hong Kong.
  The protests were a test of the Communist Party's patience with Hong Kong, said Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese politics at King's College London.
  ''They think, 'we've allowed these people all these kinds of privileges and freedoms, and look at the way they behave,''' he said. ''It will just reinforce the narrative that this is a spoiled kind of place.''
  With other pressing matters like a trade dispute with the United States and a slowing economy, however, Professor Brown said that Mr. Xi was likely to take a conservative approach, unless the unrest begins to inflict damage on Hong Kong's economy.
  ''Hong Kong lives and dies on its prowess as a financial center,'' he said."
The New York Times,2019-08-27,One United Struggle For Freedom,909 ,"
Hong Kong -- Thirty years ago, I covered a lot of democracy rallies. They were held in the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Central Europe, South Africa and the Middle East. Last week, I covered some more, this time in Hong Kong.
In many ways the Hong Kong rallies felt exactly like the rallies I covered as a cub journalist. There was the same fervent faith in democracy, the same roiling conviction that human beings deserve to live at their full dignity -- able to think what they want, read what they want, govern themselves and not simply exist half-strangled and suborned. 
  There was the same indignant desire not to live in a rigged economy run for the benefit of state-favored oligarchs.
  There was the same turning to America that we see at democracy rallies everywhere, the same sense that America is a beacon in the struggle for freedom, the same expectation that of course America is going to step in and help.
  There were even the same tactics. Decades ago, the Czechs built ''Lennon Walls,'' brightly covered walls where people post slogans and encouragement. Today, the Hong Kongers use those, too.
  In 1989 democracy protesters across the Baltics formed a vast human chain called ''The Baltic Way.'' On Friday night, 135,000 Hong Kongers formed ''The Hong Kong Way,'' a chain that stretched 50 kilometers, or 31 miles, through the city. The protesters held hands, chanted slogans. When the lights were red, they stretched from sidewalks across the streets. When the lights were green, they politely withdrew to let traffic pass.
  There was the same resolute pessimism that I remember from those democracy rallies decades ago. On the one hand these people are fervently committed. On the other hand, they don't exactly see how a ragtag bunch can beat a powerful regime that has tanks. They don't see the power of the powerless, that sometimes a shift in consciousness is stronger than military might.
  I asked several Hong Kong protesters how they thought this thing would end up. They were not optimistic. ''We're seven million,'' one man told me. ''They're 1.4 billion.'' And yet they were not going to stop protesting and putting their lives at risk.
  The big difference between now and then is technology. Today's protests feel like a frenetic, online media campaign. There is a constant flow of memes, symbols and videos to keep the clicks coming: anime art, Pepe the Frog, bloody eye patches that refer to a woman who was shot in the eye.
  The protesters sample and quote from the great buzz of global culture, which is of course what they are fighting to stay part of. A quote from ''Hunger Games'' was popular, then some Pink Floyd lyrics. The anthem of this uprising is ''Sing Hallelujah to the Lord,'' a 1974 Christian song from America.
  Technology allows the protesters to suddenly appear and suddenly disappear, ebb and flow -- to ''be water,'' in Bruce Lee's phrase.
  The protesters have online votes about where to take their protest next. They use AirDrop to download subversive pamphlets into the phones of unsuspecting tourists from mainland China.
  There's an amazing diversity of strategies. The accountants listen to speeches. The Christians sing. The radicals storm the subways.
  Of course, the technology helps the Chinese government too. Years ago, we lived under the illusion that the nimble and decentralized swarms of New Power geeks would be more technologically savvy than the clunky, Old Power hierarchies. That's not true. China's Communist government seems to be more technologically advanced than the protesters.
  There's a sense the government has the ability to surveil everything. Protesters spend enormous energy trying to go unseen. They don't use their normal subway cards for fear the state will be able to track their movements. Some protesters have been doxxed, with their private information and photos of their children splashed online. There's no pro-democracy graffiti in Hong Kong, no posters or T-shirts, no day-to-day sign that anything is happening. When they are not rallying, the protesters evaporate because even the light poles have eyes.
  My guess is that if technology helps the protesters become 30 percent more effective, it helps the state become 70 percent more effective.
  Many suspect that China will eventually crush these protests. They'll round up leaders and force businesses to fire participants. Many suspect America will never step in to help. The American right no longer believes in spreading democracy to foreigners. The American left embraces a national narrative that emphasizes slavery and oppression, not that America is a beacon or an example. Neither party any longer sees America as a vanguard nation whose very mission is to advance universal democracy and human dignity.
  But there's something stubborn about the Hong Kongers and deceptively powerful about their cause. Other protesters dreamed of freedom. These people have already lived it. It's part of their identity. They will prove more ferocious in defense of liberty than the skeptics imagine. Along the way they might rekindle the sense of democratic mission that used to burn so forcefully in American hearts.

The New York Times ,2019-11-13,Why Are People Protesting in Hong Kong _,1180 ,"
A movement that began peacefully six months ago has descended into chaos. 
HONG KONG — What started in June with  in opposition to  has devolved into a steady stream of mayhem, with some protesters embracing violent behaviors in response to . 
The , backed by Beijing, appear to have intractable differences, and there have been few signs of either side backing down. 
In the months since the demonstrations began, the unpopular bill, which would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, has been withdrawn, but the protesters’ demands have expanded to include increased democracy and an investigation of the police. 
The standoff has taken on international importance. China has viewed the protests as a challenge to its fervent nationalism, while democracy supporters worldwide have  of the autocratic Chinese government. It all comes amid a rancorous trade war between China and the United States, and some international businesses, , have found themselves stuck in a political mess they wanted no part of.
Here’s a guide to how we got here, and why violence on both sides has escalated. 
What is Hong Kong’s relationship with China?
, an international finance hub on China’s southern coast with more than seven million residents, was a British colony until 1997, when it was handed back to China under a policy known as .
The policy made Hong Kong part of China but let it keep many liberties denied to citizens on the mainland, including free speech, unrestricted internet access and the right to free assembly. The territory has its own laws, system of government and police force under a mini-constitution known as the Basic Law.  until at least 2047.
But many Hong Kongers feel that Beijing is already , and that the local government does its bidding. The territory’s top leader, the chief executive — currently Carrie Lam — is appointed by a pro-Beijing committee. 
What do protesters want?
Many people in the territory feel deep contempt for the Chinese government, and hope to preserve their freedoms for as long as possible. At its core, the movement is aimed at resisting encroachment from the mainland — but it has been complicated by rising violence.
At first, the movement was focused on a bill, , that would have allowed people accused of crimes to be sent to places with which Hong Kong had no extradition treaty — , where the courts are controlled by the Communist Party. Hundreds of thousands of people, fearing the bill would allow Beijing to target dissidents in Hong Kong with phony charges, joined  to oppose the bill on June 9. 
, for the first time, the police used pepper spray, batons and more than 150 canisters of tear gas to , a small number of whom had thrown projectiles at the police. Irate at the police response, protesters demanded an independent investigation of the police force — a demand leaders have refused. 
While  has been a driving force, protesters have extended their demands to include amnesty for arrested participants and direct elections for all lawmakers and the chief executive. The movement is largely leaderless, with decisions frequently made through . 
Why have the demonstrations turned violent?
A vast majority of participants have been nonviolent, staging strikes, surrounding police stations,  and forming huge marches. The city’s creative class has turned protest into  and .
But a minority of protesters has become increasingly destructive, hoping to force the government’s hand. Since only one of the protesters’ demands has been met — the withdrawal of the extradition bill — the more violent participants felt peaceful rallies were ineffective. 
Some protesters have thrown bricks and Molotov cocktails, and in one case . The police say that one homemade bomb . On several occasions, protesters have doled out vigilante justice, beating people who were perceived to be against their movement, including one man who was . A firebrand pro-Beijing lawmaker, Junius Ho, was . There has been considerable property damage to the train system, which protesters have accused of supporting the police, and businesses seen as pro-China. 
Protesters say the violence is in defense of excessively violent police tactics. Officers have liberally deployed tear gas in ways that defy international standards, including firing canisters from a height and using it in enclosed spaces. Several protesters have been . Cannons shooting water laced with a corrosive blue dye have become a routine presence at protests. Individual interactions with the police that are captured on video, such as the use of pepper spray against a pregnant woman and an officer on a motorcycle , have infuriated demonstrators. 
Passions were further inflamed in November when  after falling from a parking garage near demonstrations, possibly the first death of the movement. The exact circumstances surrounding his death remain unknown. 
 have resembled trench warfare, with officers firing tear gas and protesters attacking the police with firebombs, arrows and other projectiles.  went on for days, with protesters trapped as the police laid siege to the campus. A police officer was hit in the leg with an arrow, while dozens of protesters were injured or suffered from hypothermia after being hit by a water cannon.
How does it end?
No one knows. 
But despite some domestic propaganda showing  in Beijing, it appears China is trying to avoid a Tiananmen-style crackdown. Though the Chinese military has a garrison in Hong Kong, the international business community would most likely see a military intervention as the end of “one country, two systems,” and an exodus of businesses could soon follow.
Still, China does not want to bend to the protesters, whom the state news media have depicted as lawless, spoiled separatists. (Most protesters say they are uninterested in independence.)
The Hong Kong government and the police have done little to calm tensions, repeatedly denouncing the protesters while mostly defending the police’s conduct. And protesters have shown few signs of fatigue, despite thousands of arrests.

The New York Times ,2019-09-08,Protesters Besiege Hong Kong After Rally Near U.S. Consulate,1069 ,"
HONG KONG — A pro-democracy demonstration on Sunday near the United States Consulate in Hong Kong quickly devolved into vandalism and street chaos, suggesting that protesters were not mollified by a recent concession from the city’s leader.
The violence came on the heels of  since Carrie Lam, the city’s leader, announced on Wednesday that she would             that spurred the protests in June.
The march to the consulate on Sunday was an effort to drum up support for a bill that is moving through the United States Congress. It would penalize officials in mainland China and Hong Kong who suppress freedoms in the semiautonomous Chinese territory, and require an annual justification for why the United States should offer Hong Kong special trade and business privileges.
For demonstrators, making a public appeal to the United States risks playing into a bid by Beijing to , not a reflection of genuine local grievances.
And if the legislation were to further damage a Hong Kong economy that is already hurting from nearly three months of street demonstrations, the protesters could lose support from a general public that is somewhat disillusioned by their violent tactics.
Still, in a city where many people fear that Beijing is steadily destroying their freedoms, many protesters believe that anything that keeps their demands high on the international agenda is worth the risks.
“Freedom and democracy is more important than economics,” said Brian Chan, 23, an engineer who joined the march Sunday afternoon.
“Hong Kong people who love this place from their hearts want freedom,” he added. “The economy of Hong Kong is good, but most people don’t benefit.”
The march began peacefully, as hundreds of thousands rallied in a park and on streets near the consulate. Some protesters sang “The Star-Spangled Banner,” waved American flags and held a large blue-and-white banner that read: “President Trump, please liberate Hong Kong.”
“Resist Beijing!” the crowd chanted in English. “Liberate Hong Kong!”
But within hours, hard-core demonstrators on the fringes of the rally             and vandalized ticket vending machines and escalators in Central Station, a vital transit hub for shoppers and commuters. Some of them set a fire outside a station entrance.
Police officers in riot gear made arrests as they patrolled Central Station, and at least one of them fired a rubber bullet to disperse protesters. By nightfall, the police were chasing protesters through several neighborhoods on Hong Kong Island, and spraying tear gas and making arrests in the Causeway Bay shopping district.
The unrest later migrated to the Kowloon Peninsula, where residents and protesters clashed with the police in working-class neighborhoods, and some train stations were closed early.
Television footage from the Mong Kok neighborhood showed police officers searching random passers-by, including a man wearing a Captain America T-shirt, and the authorities said some protesters had “hurled hard objects” into the local police station.
Fernando Formaciari, a 60-year-old fashion executive from Italy who travels frequently to Hong Kong, said he was concerned about the how protests would affect the retail industry.
“When stores are closed, it affects business,” he said.“We hope in the end the government would find a political compromise.”
The Chinese government has accused the United States and other Western countries of sowing the seeds of discontent and attempting to foment a “revolution” in Hong Kong, albeit without providing credible evidence to support that claim.
Before the march on Sunday, the United States Consulate issued a “” on its website saying that the march and other events over the weekend might disrupt transportation around the city. A spokesman at the consulate declined to comment on the demonstrations.
The bill making its way through Congress, , was introduced in June by Representative Chris Smith, Republican of New Jersey. Similar legislation has been floating around Washington for years, and the latest version has            .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi reiterated her support for the bill in a statement on Wednesday, saying that it would “reaffirm the U.S. commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule of law in the face of Beijing’s crackdown.”
President Trump, by contrast, . He suggested last month that China should settle the problem “humanely” before reaching a trade deal with the United States, for example. But he has also called the protests “riots,” echoing the language of the Chinese government.
The protests have prompted the banking hub’s worst political crisis since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, and the movement’s demands have gradually expanded since June to include broad calls for political reform and police accountability.
But aside from promising on Wednesday to withdraw the extradition bill, Mrs. Lam, Hong Kong’s deeply unpopular leader, has so far declined to engage on the other demands.
Separately, the local news media reported on Sunday that the political activist Joshua Wong had been arrested at Hong Kong’s airport upon returning from a trip to Taiwan, apparently for violating the conditions of his release from prison in August.
Mr. Wong, 22, was released from prison in June after serving two months for convictions related to pro-democracy protests that convulsed the city in 2014. But he was  on charges of unlawfully organizing a June rally in which protesters blockaded the headquarters of the Hong Kong Police Force.
In a statement on Sunday evening, Mr. Wong said that he believed a mistake had been made on his bail certificate and that he expected to be released after a hearing on Monday morning.

The New York Times ,2019-08-30,The Mask I Wear on the Weekends,1275 ,"
In Hong Kong, I go to work and see my friends as usual. But I also spend time in a parallel universe of tear gas, barricades and anonymous allies. 
HONG KONG — In August, the air in Hong Kong takes on a life of its own. The winds weep with so much moisture that it often feels suffocating. On one of those stifling days, I welcomed a sweaty handyman into my flat. The tanned, smiling, 30-something stranger, whom I had found on a local household-repair version of “seeking arrangements,” was there to dismantle a spare bed that I was hoping to sell.
As he removed the nails from the bed frame, he asked, “So you’ve been out on the streets, eh?”
I took a step back, immediately suspicious. “What gave it away?”
“There’s a yellow hard hat by your sofa,” he said, laughing. “Don’t worry, I’m out every other week too. I’m with the first aid. Just doing what I can.”
While he smoked a cigarette in my kitchen, we chatted about the protests that have swept across the city, seeking to secure the promises made by our leaders for checks and balances on Hong Kong’s government and for certain democratic rights and freedoms. “My son keeps asking me to explain why the police are beating people up,” he told me. “Even the children know there’s something wrong.”
Before he left, he told me to call him if I ever needed anything else around the house fixed. “We’re allies,” he said. And if I was ever on the scene and needed help, he added, I had his number.
That encounter epitomizes an uncanny sensation I’ve been experiencing for months. My “real” life — the one where I show up to work every morning, have a drink in the evening with friends, hide underneath the covers reading a book at night or call a handyman for odd jobs — exists in a parallel universe, one in which the city isn’t burning. On the weekends, I enter that other world — the one in which I head out wearing safety gear, my hard hat and face mask in place — to witness the thousands marching and then go home to watch live feeds of the news late at night.
It feels as if those two worlds do not converge neatly. I don’t know most of my fellow protesters. Except for a few close friends, most people I see on a day-to-day basis, either at work or in my neighborhood, are not those I’d turn to for discussions about politics: The topic is too heavy for small talk. So on Monday mornings, I have no idea which of my colleagues also got tear-gassed the night before. Or if the grandmother who lives across the road was the same one I saw offering snacks to hungry demonstrators.
On weekends, parts of the city transform into a battlefield. The riot police take their formations, and the metal barricades on the sides of the roads are coated with pepper spray residue. On weekdays, the graffiti seems out of place as the streets are again filled with office workers, all of them hurrying somewhere.
For the past two months, wherever I go, I wonder about the people around me: Do they know what’s happening in this city? I look at them — the impossibly fit women in leggings at my weekend yoga class, the employee at the Japanese takeout shop who hands me my bento, the teenagers playing basketball outside my building. Are any of them out there at the protests?
Even my family lives in an alternate reality. They have been taking turns forwarding me misinformation that smears the protesters, text messages that originate from unknown sources. One of them assures me the family has “no intention of meddling with my life,” but sends me pro-China propaganda anyway.
Once in a while, something pierces through the illusion. At a recent demonstration, a protester in black grabbed my arm.
“Hey! You recognize me? I was in the same class as you in law school!” I didn’t.
“Maybe if you took off your mask?” I suggested. “I can’t tell who you are just from the eyes. Though you probably shouldn’t take it off now.” Fifteen minutes later, we were hit by tear gas, and he dissolved into the crowd.
The looming threat of prosecution, for taking part in what the Hong Kong government calls “illegal protests,” has forced us into anonymity. In the online forums where protest strategies are discussed, we adopt weird handles and real names are never used. A popular saying among the protesters these days is, “One day, we’ll be able to take off our masks, embrace and finally see each other.” The Hong Kong government has since the first major anti-extradition protests in June, including             on Friday, so that day seems further and further away.
Even the online world has fractured into different planes. While forum discussions are anonymous, regular social media has become a way for Hong Kongers to express their positions on the protests. Many of my friends are journalists, so perhaps I live in a protest bubble — most people I know on social media are posting about nothing else. Some of my friends, who experienced their political enlightenment during the Umbrella Movement in 2014, have now completely dedicated themselves to stalling the rapid undermining of Hong Kong’s remaining freedoms. Even those who never used to follow politics — as if politics were separate from our everyday lives — are suddenly posting about the protests on Instagram.
The ones who are silent are silent for the predictable reasons. I had seen them proudly post photos of themselves standing next to government officials, or hint at their career ambitions in China. Other friends, who I knew were active in the protests, choose to keep their contributions discreet. One of them : “Perhaps we’re staying anonymous out of fear. But it’s also egalitarian in a way, that whatever we do, we’re just ordinary people who love Hong Kong.”
At least those who oppose the movement outright are taking a stance. More inexplicable are those who refuse to engage, secure in the privilege of brushing the protests aside. Or those who claim to support the protests and then withdraw that support once it disrupts their everyday lives, even though that is the point of civil disobedience.
All these worlds are increasingly colliding. Two weekends ago, I met friends for dinner at Causeway Bay, one of Hong Kong’s busiest shopping districts. When we left the restaurant, there were police charging at protesters. The huge billboard outside, usually flashing with ads for luxury bags or beauty products, was switched off. I had never seen those streets at night so dark. That evening, I stepped over a pool of blood at the subway station as I took the train home.
The protests are getting harder to ignore. They are no longer confined to specific locations; they are popping up sporadically all over the city, often on weekdays, too. It is becoming impossible to pretend that this political movement exists only on the fringes.
This is the only parallel universe I long for: the one where kids spend their summers at the malls, singing karaoke and complaining about holiday homework — not organizing rallies or worrying about . It’s the one where everyone in the city can be out in the streets, and no one has to guess who their allies are.

The New York Times ,2019-07-19,Hong Kong _s Approach to Protesters_ No More Concessions,1074 ,"
HONG KONG — Hong Kong’s leader will not be making further concessions to the city’s protesters, two of her top advisers said, as the government digs in despite several large demonstrations over the past month and more planned for Sunday and the coming weeks.
Carrie Lam, the region’s chief executive, will focus instead on hearing from various sectors of the Hong Kong population and drafting a broad policy address for delivery in mid-October, said Bernard Chan, the convenor of her Executive Council, or cabinet, in an interview on Friday.
Mr. Chan’s remarks — and similar comments by Regina Ip, another Executive Council member, in a separate interview — indicate that Mrs. Lam’s administration is confident that it can weather further protests, despite several recent violent clashes and signs that the economy could suffer.
Waiting and hoping that protests fade away worked for the government during the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement in 2014, in which demonstrators occupied sections of major roads for months. But Mrs. Lam’s refusal to meet the current protesters’ demands, including a call for her resignation, runs the risk of driving large turnouts at rallies and more violent confrontations.
In her October address, Mrs. Lam plans to emphasize that the government will improve its consultation with the public before rolling out new draft laws or policies, Mr. Chan said by phone from Australia, where he was on a trip to promote investment in Hong Kong and neighboring cities. The large protests that started in early June were driven by Mrs. Lam’s hasty introduction of a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China.
The bill angered a broad swath of the Hong Kong public, who worried that it would potentially expose anyone in the city to trials in the mainland’s opaque judicial system.
Even though Mrs. Lam has  the bill and             protests have continued to draw large crowds. Demonstrators have demanded, among other things, the formal withdrawal of the legislation, Mrs. Lam’s resignation and an independent inquiry into the police’s actions against demonstrators.
Mr. Chan said that by suspending the bill, the government had already done everything it could be expected to do in response to the protesters. He suggested that they were effectively seeking independence for the semiautonomous Chinese region.
“I don’t think they would stop even if you met their demands,” he said. “They just don’t want Hong Kong to be part of China, which is impossible.”
He added that Mrs. Lam would not resign and said he had not heard her express any desire to do so, even in private.
Mrs. Lam is also unlikely to reopen the longstanding issue of introducing universal suffrage, Mr. Chan said. In recent weeks, the protesters have increasingly called for direct elections, drawing into focus the deep-seated anxiety among many in Hong Kong over the recent erosion of freedoms promised in 1997 when Britain returned the city to Chinese control, under the authoritarian Communist Party.
Mr. Chan said universal suffrage would only be up for negotiation if democracy advocates first accepted a proposal made by Beijing five years ago. It would have allowed general elections for the city’s top job, but a committee dominated by Beijing loyalists would have decided which candidates would be allowed on the ballot.
The Umbrella Movement protesters rejected that offer as inadequate, and the proposal did not become Hong Kong law. Without a clear agreement in advance from democracy advocates to accept the proposal, Mr. Chan said, “it is not that helpful to reopen that dialogue.”
Some politicians think the pro-democracy movement plans to try to keep up the momentum of their rallies until November, when elections will be held to choose members of the region’s district councils.
“Because of the district council elections in November, the government is sitting tight, trying not to anger voters,” said Mrs. Ip, who is also a pro-Beijing member of the legislature.
But the government’s strategy of delay carries risks, for both the government and the protesters.
Further protests could hurt the local economy. The parent companies of brands like Swatch, Cartier and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels have reported in recent days that their financial results were hurt in the second quarter by faltering sales in Hong Kong, a big retailing and finance hub for East Asia and particularly China.
Financial leaders say that some wealthy families from mainland China and Hong Kong itself have been transferring sizable chunks of their holdings from bank accounts in Hong Kong to accounts elsewhere, particularly in Singapore.
Mr. Chan, who is also the president of a Hong Kong insurance company, said that Hong Kong’s role as a financial hub has not been affected. Some people who made their money through corrupt activities on the mainland may now be moving it farther away to evade mainland law enforcement, but there had been early signs of that trend even before the current dispute, he said.
More protests could also result in injuries or deaths among demonstrators or police. Violence by protesters, including the beating of a police officer last weekend that was recorded on video and widely replayed online, could gradually undermine public support.
Many pro-democracy advocates, however, have said the movement has remained united even when some protesters have taken a more confrontational approach.
Protest organizers say that they believe that they have the stamina and public support to last in a prolonged dispute. Bonnie Leung, a vice convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, which is one of the main groups backing the protests, said that the police had  and were therefore responsible for violence by protesters.
“We cannot control the protests, we do not want to,” she said. “If the police behave themselves, protesters will be peaceful.”

The New York Times ,2019-06-20,Hong Kong Protests Resume as Police Headquarters Is Surrounded,1392 ,"
HONG KONG — Thousands of protesters blocked a major thoroughfare and surrounded the headquarters of Hong Kong’s police force on Friday, putting new pressure on the city’s leadership over an unpopular bill that has thrown the territory into a political crisis.
The demonstrators, mostly teenagers and people in their 20s dressed in black, filled the main roads around the police complex in stifling 90-degree weather, chanting calls for the authorities to release protesters who were arrested last week. The government shut down its headquarters for the day, citing security concerns, and the legislature canceled meetings.
It was the latest of several mass demonstrations in the span of two weeks that have paralyzed parts of downtown Hong Kong, in scenes reminiscent of the 2014 pro-democracy Umbrella Movement protests, which saw major districts occupied for more than two months.
The protesters have felt emboldened since Carrie Lam, the city’s chief executive,  the contentious extradition bill last Saturday. As many as two million protesters             the next day, organizers contend.
The protesters are not satisfied with Mrs. Lam’s suspension of the bill, which would allow extraditions to mainland China. Instead, the protesters want Mrs. Lam to withdraw the law fully.
The alarm over the bill underscores many Hong Kong residents’ rising anxiety and frustration over the erosion of civil liberties that have set the city apart from the rest of China.
“This is Hong Kong, not China,” declared a large, white banner displayed along the side of a pedestrian bridge on Friday.
The protesters began their day with a sit-in outside the Legislative Council building, but after several hours they mobilized to block streets. Kenneth Kwan, a 19-year-old student, said he had helped to shut down a major road because he thought it would make a stronger statement than a mere sit-in would.
“It’s a helpless feeling, and we don’t know how to make our government respond to our needs,” he said through a face mask, standing in an eastbound lane of Harcourt Road. The protesters, he said, needed to keep pressure on the government until their demands were met.
By midmorning, the protesters had set up barricades at police headquarters blocking an entrance and demanded a meeting with the police chief. “Shame on dirty cops,” they chanted.
Joshua Wong, a key leader of the 2014 pro-democracy protests, who was , shouted slogans decrying the authorities for having previously labeled the June 12 demonstration a riot, which suggested serious potential legal ramifications for people who participated in it.
“No riots, only tyranny,” he chanted, as others followed.
The police urged the demonstrators to disperse, saying they had prevented them from responding to dozens of emergency calls. Yolanda Yu, a police spokeswoman, said at a news conference steps from where protesters were gathered that a team of negotiators would be sent to persuade them to leave. The crowd shouted over her.
The police were “not clearing the grounds,” Ms. Yu said. “We respect the people to express their views in a peaceful manner.”
The police maintained a low-level presence at the protest sites, including their own headquarters, apparently trying to avoid raising tensions. Local media reported that the protesters had blocked all of the street-level entrances at the police complex.
On Friday night, with protesters still gatherered around the police complex — where some began to throw eggs at the building and write graffiti on it — the city government issued a statement urging them to be peaceful and reasonable, saying a number of public services had been disrupted. Demonstrators had filled the lobbies of at least two other government buildings during the day.
The protesters eventually dispersed before dawn on Saturday, and the police began removing the barricades the demonstrators had put up.
“Although there were fewer participants today, we could occupy the police headquarters and the Revenue Tower, which we had never done before,” Sunny Cheung, a 23-year-old university student, said on Friday, referring to one of the government buildings. “We will not retreat, nor will we give in, until the government takes our demands into account.”
The protesters had vowed to resume street demonstrations after a set of demands went unmet by a Thursday deadline. Aside from the scrapping of the bill, the protesters also called for Mrs. Lam’s resignation, the release of people arrested during clashes with the police last week and an investigation into the police’s use of batons, tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters in clashes on June 12.
The demonstrations on Friday signaled that the fight was not over , and foreshadowed more upheaval in the city.
“To not keep even the central government headquarters open, to not keep the police headquarters open, it’s a big humiliation,” said Willy Lam, a political analyst who teaches at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “It means basically she has lost the ability to govern effectively.”
The massive outcry over the extradition bill this month prompted Mrs. Lam to deliver a personal, televised  on Tuesday for having proposed it in the first place.
But she did not agree to resign or withdraw the bill entirely, as many protesters have demanded. Instead, she said that work on it would not resume in Hong Kong’s legislature as long as there was a public dispute over the bill’s content.
On Friday, Ann Chiang, a pro-Beijing lawmaker, said in an interview with a local TV station that the government could consider reintroducing the bill after a few months of educating the public about it — a suggestion sure to rankle protesters who already doubt Mrs. Lam’s sincerity about suspending the bill. Ms. Chiang’s pro-establishment party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, quickly distanced itself from her comments.
The  the authorities in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory, to send people suspected of crimes to jurisdictions with which it does not have an extradition agreement, including mainland China. Opponents of the bill fear that if it becomes law, it would open a door for Beijing to take anyone from Hong Kong — including dissidents — into the mainland’s opaque, politicized judicial system.
[]
Under China’s president, Xi Jinping, the ruling Communist Party has increasingly tried to exert control over Hong Kong, which has its own laws, independent courts and news outlets, as well as a vocal community of pro-democracy activists and lawmakers. On Friday, Albert del Rosario, a former Philippine foreign secretary who accused Mr. Xi of crimes against humanity in an international court, told The Associated Press by telephone that he had flown to Hong Kong for a business meeting but was blocked by immigration officers from entering, in what he described as an act of harassment.
Beijing has steadily eroded Hong Kong’s liberties over the last several years, including by  and             with its supporters.
Mr. Lam, the analyst at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that Mrs. Lam, the city’s leader, would be unlikely to bend on two of the protesters’ major demands — the withdrawal of the bill and her own resignation — because those were decisions only Beijing could make.
“Xi Jinping must be very mad, but they can’t just fire her because there would be a power vacuum,” Mr. Lam said. “Particularly at this time, there are no obvious and viable successors on the horizon.”

The New York Times,2019-09-05,Bill That Riled Hong Kongers Will Be Pulled,1563 ,"
HONG KONG -- Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, said Wednesday that the government would withdraw a contentious extradition bill that ignited months of protests in the city, moving to quell the worst political crisis since the former British colony returned to Chinese control 22 years ago.
The move responds to a major demand of the protesters, who feared China would exploit the measure to extradite suspects for prosecution in China's opaque judicial system. But it was unclear if the concession would be enough to bring an end to intensifying demonstrations, which are now driven by multiple grievances with the government. 
  ''Incidents over these past two months have shocked and saddened Hong Kong people,'' she said in an eight-minute televised statement broadcast shortly before 6 p.m. ''We are all very anxious about Hong Kong, our home. We all hope to find a way out of the current impasse and unsettling times.''
  Her decision, which was met with skepticism by some pro-democracy figures in Hong Kong, comes as the protests near their three-month mark and show little sign of abating, roiling a city known for its orderliness and hurting its economy.
  It also came as something of a surprise: Just a day before, China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office had signaled an uncompromising stance toward the protests. Yang Guang, a spokesman for the office, said at a briefing in Beijing that there could be ''no middle ground, no hesitance and no dithering, when it comes to stopping the violence and controlling riots in Hong Kong.''
  A possible hint of a change in Beijing's stand, however, came from the country's leader, Xi Jinping. In a speech on Tuesday to the Party School of the Communist Party's Central Committee, Mr. Xi called on rising party officials to show resolve for a long struggle but suggested that the leadership could adjust its tactics to achieve its aims.
  ''On matters of principle, not an inch will be yielded,'' Mr. Xi said, ''but on matters of tactics there can be flexibility.''
  Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University and the author of ''China Tomorrow: Democracy or Dictatorship?'' suggested on Wednesday evening that Beijing had asked Mrs. Lam to make the decision as a tactical calculation ahead of the Oct. 1 anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of China.
  The aim, he said, was ''to calm down the movement's moderates'' and ''weaken and isolate the radicals.''
  ''Maybe it is a good calculation on the part of Beijing,'' he added, ''but it may also fail.''
  By early Thursday, the Chinese government had not made any public comment on Mrs. Lam's announcement, and state-run Chinese media gave her withdrawal of the extradition bill relatively brief, muted coverage. Absent was any of the fiery commentary that has dominated mainland Chinese reporting of Hong Kong's turmoil, suggesting that Communist Party officials may still be working out a reaction designed to counter accusations of retreat.
  Mrs. Lam had suspended the bill in June and later said that it was ''dead,'' but demonstrators have long been suspicious of her government's refusal to formally withdraw the bill and feared that it could be revived at a later date.
  Withdrawal of the bill has remained at the top of the list of protesters' demands. But the list has grown to include an independent investigation into the police response, amnesty for arrested protesters and direct elections for all lawmakers and the chief executive.
  [What's going on in Hong Kong? What to know about the protests.]
  Michael Tien, a moderate pro-Beijing lawmaker, said withdrawal alone might have been enough to calm the protests in mid-June. But since then, ''with the accumulation of so much resentment, so many accusations and so many disputes,'' the establishment of an independent inquiry ''is 100 percent necessary,'' Mr. Tien said.
  At least some of the hard-line, pro-Beijing camp in Hong Kong expressed skepticism on Wednesday evening about Mrs. Lam's overture, seeing it not as a clever gambit to ease pressure but rather as a sign of political weakness that would only encourage further protests.
  One hard-liner, who insisted on anonymity because of political sensitivities, said that the initial hostility to the overture from democracy advocates showed that the hard-liners' worries about concessions were being vindicated.
  Mrs. Lam described the withdrawal as a step to initiate dialogue. She also said she would add two members to an existing police review board, but that step was far short of calls for an independent investigation.
  Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker, described Mrs. Lam's announcement as a ''political performance.''
  ''That it took her three months to formally use the word 'withdraw' is truly too little, too late,'' Ms. Mo told reporters. ''A big mistake has been made.''
  This summer has seen peaceful marches involving hundreds of thousands of people, as well as street protests by smaller groups who have become increasingly violent in recent weeks, throwing bricks and firebombs at the police. More than 1,100 people have been arrested since early June. The police, who have used batons, rubber bullets and tear gas against protesters, have faced allegations of excessive force.
  Months of protests have started to ripple through the economy, hurting some small businesses and the tourism industry. Many economists believe the city's economy is now slipping into recession.
  Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed up 3.9 percent on Wednesday as the prospect of Mrs. Lam's news conference began circulating. Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based airline that has faced criticism from the Chinese government for its employees' participation in the protests, climbed more than 7 percent. After the market closed, the company announced the resignation of its chairman.
  Withdrawal of the extradition bill was the initial demand of protesters, and the rallying cry when, by organizers' estimates, more than one million people marched on June 9 and nearly two million marched a week later, more than one in every four people in Hong Kong.
  Withdrawal of the bill ''will help to an insignificant extent,'' said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Center for China Studies.
  The concession ''might pacify a small sector of the population but it will not have any impact on whether the waves of protests would subside,'' he added.
  On LIHKG, an online forum popular with protesters, several posts on Wednesday repeated longstanding calls not to compromise until all demands are met. The Civil Human Right Front, which has organized huge protest marches against the bill, said it would also continue its campaign until the protesters' calls were satisfied.
  Full withdrawal of the extradition bill has long been seen as the easiest compromise that the government could make. But mainland Chinese officials had objected to that possibility, saying that doing so would suggest that the original intentions behind the legislation were mistaken.
  Chinese officials had also said that any independent inquiry into the police's conduct and other aspects of the unrest could not be started until the protests died down.
  Over weeks of protests, state news outlets and other commentators on the mainland unleashed scathing criticism of the protesters, portraying them as rioters and, in some cases, suggesting they were traitors or terrorists. One analyst said Beijing may have been motivated to allow a concession in order to begin reining in the nationalistic rhetoric to some degree.
  ''Beijing loves the nationalistic sentiment, but only to the point that it's controllable,'' said Samson Yuen, an assistant professor of political science at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. ''At some point Beijing wants to rein that in for fear that these nationalistic sentiments will point toward the government.''
  As the protests dragged on, pro-Beijing lawmakers had expressed concern that the anger at the government would hurt their camp in district council elections in November and legislative elections next year.
  Saturday, the fifth anniversary of a decision by China's legislature to put limits on direct elections in Hong Kong, saw some of the most intense clashes since the protests began. After a march by tens of thousands, some protesters gathered around the main government offices, hurling rocks and firebombs. Riot police officers fired tear gas and pumped blue-dyed water from trucks at protesters.
  Protesters built barricades and set fires, and the police later pursued them across several neighborhoods, arresting dozens. In a subway station in the Prince Edward neighborhood, officers from the police's Special Tactical Squad entered a stopped train, using batons to hit people who were crouching on the floor and dousing them with pepper spray.
  The Chinese government was initially silent on this summer's protests, then began to condemn them in increasingly strident tones, warning that the military could be called in.

Joshua Wong, a key leader of the pro-democracy sit-in that roiled Hong Kong for months in 2014, was released from prison on Monday, buoying a new protest movement reminiscent of the one that led to his incarceration.
Mr. Wong, 22, served a month of his two-month prison sentence, his second such term on charges related to the 2014 protests. It is not unusual in Hong Kong for prisoners to be released early for good behavior, and Mr. Wong’s release had been expected.
But it came just one day after hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protest  and voice concern that their civil liberties were under threat from China’s central government.
Minutes after Mr. Wong emerged from the prison on Monday, toting a clear bag full of books through throngs of reporters, he said the extradition bill should be fully withdrawn and called for Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s embattled chief executive, to step down. Mrs. Lam on Saturday said only that she would suspend the bill.
“We will not keep silent under the suppression of President Xi and the chief executive Carrie Lam,” Mr. Wong said, referring to President Xi Jinping of China.
Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory with its own legal and political system, has been a foothold of democracy in China since it was returned from Britain in 1997 — and a test of how much democracy China is willing to stomach.
Though half of the city’s legislators are elected, the government is controlled by Beijing appointees. Still, the territory allows street protests that would never be permitted in the mainland.
The most recent protests in Hong Kong, a city of about seven million, were set off by a proposed extradition law that would allow criminal suspects to be transferred for trial in mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party. The Hong Kong government say the law is necessary to , but critics fear that Beijing will use it to target political dissidents outside the mainland.
Organizers estimated that  attended a march against the bill on June 9, topped the following Sunday by a march they said            .
In between the two marches, a demonstration outside the local legislature  on Wednesday when protesters trying to storm the building were met with tear gas and rubber bullets from riot police officers. Many protesters cited the police response as one of their reasons for joining the march on Sunday.
Mr. Wong told reporters on Monday that unless Ms. Lam resigned, “more and more Hong Kong people, not only one million or two million people, will come and join our fight until we get back our basic human rights and freedom.”
He later appeared outside the legislature, where protesters greeted him with uproarious applause and cheers. He said he had been following the anti-extradition movement from prison and thanked those who had protested the bill. Mr. Wong, who said he had not yet changed out of the clothes he was wearing when he entered prison, told the crowd he was ready to join the fight after taking some time to adjust.
The protests this month have been mostly leaderless. A local civil rights group received permits for the two Sunday marches, but the protest on Wednesday developed organically through social media and messaging apps.
But in 2014, Mr. Wong was  of the sit-in known as the Umbrella Movement, in which thousands of students and other demonstrators blocked major roadways for 79 days as they called for freer elections. While the movement failed to meet its short-term objectives, it was a formative experience for many young activists and its influence has been apparent in the anti-extradition protests.
Terri Li, a 22-year-old student, welcomed Mr. Wong’s desire to get involved in the latest demonstrations.
“His opinions would reach a larger audience and bring out more people,” she said.
But not everyone wanted to see Mr. Wong, who became the face of the 2014 movement, again take the lead.
“The current circumstances of the movement is already very good and I don’t want to see another leader emerge,” said Jerry Ng, a 16-year-old student.
Mr. Wong is among more than 100 people who have been convicted on charges related to the Umbrella Movement, and many of his pro-democracy followers considered him a political prisoner.
He  last month after an appeals court reduced it to two months from three because of his age at the time of his arrest in 2014. He was originally sentenced in January 2018 after pleading guilty to contempt of court charges for refusing to leave an Umbrella Movement site when it was dismantled.
In 2016, Mr. Wong was separately  related to his actions at the start of the protests. Though he was initially            , prosecutors successfully appealed for a tougher punishment, and a year later he was instead            . He was released after serving 69 days and a court later            .

HONG KONG — Protesters held another march in Hong Kong on Sunday, the first major action since a small group of demonstrators broke into the city’s legislature last Monday in a dramatic escalation of recent tensions.
It was the latest in a series of protests that have roiled  since the city’s leaders tried to push through a contentious bill that would allow extradition to mainland China. The protests, which organizers say have drawn up to two million people, have been mostly peaceful, apart from a few violent confrontations between police officers and demonstrators.
Organizers said about 230,000 turned out for Sunday’s protests. The police said the turnout was 56,000 at its peak.
Tensions culminated last week when an offshoot group of young protesters  and ransacked the premises, as hundreds of thousands of people marched peacefully in a concurrent protest elsewhere in the city.
Late Sunday night, the police and dozens of protesters clashed in the Mong Kok District a couple of hours after the march nearby had ended, leading to five arrests. The demonstrators sought to occupy a major road, but the police declared it an unlawful assembly and began warning protesters to leave. Officers with batons, shields and helmets then began clearing out the crowd. At least one man was seen being taken away by the police.
Though the extradition bill has been suspended, the protesters’ demands have broadened to include a call for more democratic reforms such as universal suffrage, in addition to a full withdrawal of the bill, an independent inquiry into police violence toward protesters and amnesty for the protesters.
[Here’s  about Hong Kong’s evolving protest movement.]
Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory, has a separate political and judicial system and is governed based on a principle known as “one country, two systems.” But in recent years, as Beijing has grown more autocratic and increased efforts to integrate Hong Kong with the mainland, many here have become alarmed about the  for civic freedoms and rule of law.
While previous marches have been held in the downtown financial and business districts of Hong Kong Island, the march on Sunday is the first to take place in Kowloon, an area of Hong Kong that is attached to the Chinese mainland. It is being billed as an opportunity to engage with mainland Chinese in the hope that they will back the protesters.
The Hong Kong protests have been heavily censored in the mainland, where they are portrayed by government officials and the state news media as being organized by “foreign forces” and spearheaded by violent “.”
Josie Kwok, 18, said she saw the protest on Sunday as an opportunity to reset the tone following the clashes last week.
“I think the most important thing today is for the protests to be peaceful,” she said. “We want to show mainlanders that Hong Kong isn’t China, and we want to show other Hong Kongers and the world that we are peaceful so we can gain their support.”
The march began in the late afternoon in Tsim Sha Tsui, a shopping area popular with mainland Chinese tourists, and ended at the West Kowloon railway station, which is the terminus of a high-speed line to the Chinese city of Guangzhou. In addition to the five arrested during the nighttime clashes, another person was arrested during the protest for failing to produce identification.
Mainland tourists, many carrying shopping bags, watched and took photographs as the protesters marched past designer stores.
Sunny Yang, 37, a mainlander who has lived in Hong Kong for nine years, said she had always felt somewhat “awkward” about the protests, which have at times taken on an anti-China tone. But seeing the scale and largely peaceful nature of the protests this time around, she said, left her feeling quite “positive.”
“It doesn’t really affect us, but it’s a very big issue for these young people,” she said as she gestured toward the protesters. “I think the local government should really listen to the people.”
Liu Xiao, 28, came to Hong Kong from Chongqing with friends to do some shopping. She had heard about the protests but said she thought the extradition bill was “justifiable.”
“If people have committed crimes, they shouldn’t be allowed to dodge the law,” she said.
Opponents of the bill fear that it could be used to send political dissidents for trial in mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party.
Seeing the protest on Sunday was “shocking” for Liu Li, 22, who runs a small baking company in the southern Chinese city of Jiujiang and was visiting Hong Kong for the first time.
“We would never be allowed to do something like this in the mainland,” she said. “Even if 100 people gather together, they would get detained.”
The opening of the West Kowloon station last year has . Mainland customs and immigration officials are stationed inside the railway terminus and parts of the station are subject to mainland jurisdiction, which has prompted some pro-democracy advocates and scholars to call it a “Trojan train.”
Law enforcement officials had been bracing for a large turnout and possible clashes with mainland visitors. The police shut down some roads and put up large plastic barricades around West Kowloon station. All but one of the entrances and exits to the station were closed. Sales for tickets departing from the station also ended midday.
Timothy Chui, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, said that some mainland tour groups decided to avoid the Tsim Sha Tsui area on Sunday because of the planned march.
By Sunday evening around 9, the official protest had dissipated. A small group of mostly masked demonstrators stayed behind at the rail terminus, jeering at the police officers, who stood behind the barricades.
While the turnout for Sunday’s protests exceeded organizers’ expectations, it was significantly smaller in scale than the demonstrations in previous weeks. But many protesters said they were determined to keep going. Another demonstration was announced for next weekend.
“I have participated in all of the protests already,” said Alex Leung, 57, a construction worker. “And I will continue to participate until this Hong Kong government responds to us and fulfills our demands.”

Tear-gassed, beaten and dragged. Experts in crowd control say the Hong Kong police used excessive force on protesters during a demonstration in June. 
[] 
Dozens of people in Hong Kong say they were injured by the police during a mass demonstration in June against a  that would allow extraditions to mainland China. 
The New York Times reviewed hundreds of videos and photos posted online by witnesses, along with submissions to our , to assess whether the Hong Kong police used excessive force. Experts at Amnesty International, a human rights group, helped examine the footage. We spoke to specialists in crowd control and interviewed more than two dozen protesters. 
The videos show protesters being beaten by police officers, shot with riot-control ammunition, dragged on the ground and hit with tear gas during large-scale  on June 12 near the headquarters of Hong Kong’s government. Their injuries included bruised ribs, broken fingers and respiratory problems.
The authorities began to use force after a small group of protesters  at officers and attempted to push through rings of heavily armored police.
But the protests were largely peaceful, and human rights groups have denounced the  The British government, which ruled Hong Kong until its handover to mainland China in 1997, has demanded an investigation. Hong Kong officials say police officers acted with restraint. 
Here’s what the evidence shows.
Violence Toward Unarmed Protesters
In several instances, police officers beat protesters who posed no apparent threat.
The video below shows Ng Ying-mo, 57, a retired mechanics instructor, walking within 12 yards of a police line outside government offices. He asks the police to stop provoking protesters. Then he begins yelling obscenities. 
An officer aims a gun, which weapons experts said was likely loaded with balls containing pepper spray, in the direction of Mr. Ng. A gunshot is heard, and then Mr. Ng is on the ground, clutching his lower abdomen. Three officers pick him up and carry him away. 
Mr. Ng had planned to go hiking on the day of the protests. But he grew emotional when he heard about tense standoffs between the riot police and young protesters, and decided to join in.
“I hoped to shield them at least for a while, so they wouldn’t face such danger,” Mr. Ng said.
Mr. Ng, who suffers from lung cancer, said he fainted from the pain and woke up to the police dropping him on the ground. They continued to beat him, he said, ripping his T-shirt and shorts and leaving him with bruises. He was charged with participating in an unlawful assembly and released on bail. 
In the video below, a protester stands in the middle of the same road where Mr. Ng was injured. Suddenly, riot police rush toward him, pulling him to the ground and beating him. 
The man is taken to the sidewalk and forcefully handled by several officers. He was arrested on charges of participating in an unlawful assembly and obstructing the duties of a police officer, according to Icarus Wong, a member of Civil Rights Observer, an advocacy group that is assisting the man, who did not want to be identified.
In another video, a man who is distributing water to protesters near the General Post Office is attacked by police. A group of at least eight police officers pepper sprays him, punches him and beats him with batons. He falls to the ground, and an officer puts him in a chokehold. The man was left with a scar under his left eye, according to his lawyer, Bond Ng, who declined to identify him. He was arrested and later released on bail, his lawyer said.
“This is basically an essay on how not to police a protest movement,” said Dr. Rohini Haar of Physicians for Human Rights, an advocacy organization. “Beating of unarmed protesters who are not posing any active threat” is a violation of  prescribed by the United Nations, she said.
In the video below, protesters run from police outside the main entrance to Hong Kong’s Legislative Council. Florence Chan, a protester who had been singing hymns, falls to the ground amid the chaos. At least four officers begin to attack her with batons and shields. 
Ms. Chan said in an interview that she begged the officers to stop hitting her. “I thought they were going to beat me to death,” Ms. Chan said. She said she was left with bumps on her head, bruises on her arms and swollen feet.
Experts said the police did not seem to have a legitimate reason to beat the protesters.
“The officers are using force when the person is already on the floor,” said Ara Marcen Naval, an arms control adviser at Amnesty International. “That’s abusive and certainly unlawful.” 
The police did not respond to a request for comment. Hong Kong officials have defended the , describing officers as well trained and saying they acted with restraint. The police initially described the protests as a riot and accused the protesters of committing “.”
Even as many in Hong Kong denounce the police, others have defended their response. On Sunday, tens of thousands of people attended a rally in support of the police, with some holding signs praising the Hong Kong police as the “best in Asia.” 
The police and a government-appointed watchdog have promised an investigation, but protesters have called for an independent inquiry.
The government has said that at least 81 people were injured in the June 12 demonstrations, though it has not specified how many were protesters or how they were hurt. Separately, the police have said 22 officers were injured.
Chaos and Tear Gas Inside a Skyscraper
Some of the most chaotic scenes took place at Citic Tower, a 33-story office building near the epicenter of the protests. Police used tear gas to attack protesters and confine them outside the tower’s main entrance, causing panic, videos show.
Early on June 12, protesters set up barricades outside the tower.
Around 3 p.m., police officers surround the tower on both sides, firing tear gas. Trapped by the police and barricades, protesters rush toward the tower’s main entrance.
Hundreds of people rush into the tower through a revolving door. The protesters who make it inside attempt to break open locked doors to allow more people through. The police continue to fire tear gas into the crowd of protesters, and it soon fills the building.
Ivy Chan, 44, a volunteer who was assisting protesters outside the tower, said she saw people pounding on the doors of the tower, desperate to escape. 
“It was terrifying,” Ms. Chan, a bartender, said. “We kept telling people to calm down and asking the police to exercise restraint and to not shoot any more tear gas.”
International experts on the use of tear gas said the Hong Kong police had used it without a clear strategy, causing unnecessary panic and heightening the risk of casualties. They said the amount deployed was excessive, given that the demonstrators were largely peaceful.
“They’re actually inciting and causing what looks like a stampede,” Dr. Haar said. 
A Lawmaker Confronts the Police
As the protests escalated, Wu Chi-wai, a prominent Hong Kong lawmaker, wanted to have a word with the police. So he marched to the front lines of the protest, identifying himself as a lawmaker in a loud voice, and demanded to see a commander.
As Mr. Wu, 56, moves toward the police, a commander in a white shirt directs another officer to fire tear gas, which lands a few meters behind Mr. Wu, videos show. Mr. Wu continues marching and a second canister is fired and lands much closer to him, catching fire upon impact.
Anna Feigenbaum, an expert on tear gas at Bournemouth University in Britain, said the officers appeared to use tear gas like a firearm. “It should never really be used to single out someone,” she said.
Mr. Wu, chairman of the Hong Kong Democratic Party, said he posed no threat. “If they can blow tear gas on me,” he said, “that means they can blow tear gas everywhere.”
‘They Treated Me Like a Dead Object’
Ali Li, a 21-year-old university student, thought the protests over the extradition bill might get turbulent. But she did not anticipate that she would leave the demonstrations with bruises covering her body, a painful finger injury and cuts on her forehead.
As the police ordered protesters to leave an area near the Hong Kong Legislature, Ms. Li tripped on a barricade and lost her balance. Suddenly, at least four officers surrounded her and grabbed her arms, trying to subdue her. She fell to the ground and the police fired pepper spray at her face, she said. 
Ms. Li said she was dragged for more than 150 meters by the police into the offices of the legislature. She screamed along the way.
“They treated me like a dead object,” Ms. Li said in an interview. “They have lost their sanity.”
Ms. Li was arrested on charges of participating in an unlawful assembly and released after about two hours, she said. She stopped protesting because she said she was too afraid of the police. “Even now,” she said, “I feel so scared.”

A day commemorating Hong Kong’s handover to China took an ominous turn as one group of demonstrators stormed the territory’s legislature.
Daylong demonstrations on Monday in Hong Kong drew hundreds of thousands of people and culminated in heavy damage to the building that houses the territory’s Legislative Council. 
Protests that were mostly peaceful were first marred by morning clashes with the police, who used batons and pepper spray against protesters outside a ceremony commemorating the 22nd anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to Chinese control. 
Later, the demonstrations again turned destructive when a group of protesters stormed the legislature and worked for hours to move deeper into the building, even while hundreds of thousands of others marched peacefully outside. 
One group of protesters used makeshift battering rams to destroy the legislature’s glass windows and doors as they made their way into the building. 
The following photographs give a visual timeline of the day’s events, which began around 5:30 a.m., when protesters tried to disrupt a speech by the territory’s chief executive, Carrie Lam.

HONG KONG -- A subway train derailed in Hong Kong on Tuesday, injuring at least five passengers and snarling the morning rush-hour commute in a city whose transit system has been routinely disrupted by three months of pro-democracy protests.
One man and four women were hospitalized after the accident near a major station on the city's Kowloon Peninsula, a government spokesman said. The Fire Services Department said their injuries included light scratches and neck and shoulder injuries. 
  Such accidents are exceedingly rare in Hong Kong, and there was no indication that the crash was related to the protests that have prompted the former British colony's worst political crisis since it was handed back to Chinese control in 1997. But the accident nevertheless stirred initial concerns that it was linked to the unrest.
  The crash comes after an especially violent weekend of street clashes, in which the Hong Kong police fired tear gas and water cannons after protesters vandalized a subway station and attacked government offices with bricks and gasoline bombs.
  Adi Lau, the operations director for Hong Kong's subway operator, the MTR Corporation, told reporters on Tuesday that three middle carriages of the 12-carriage train had derailed. He said it was too early to draw conclusions about the cause of the accident.
  At a separate news conference, Frank Chan, Hong Kong's secretary for transport and housing, called the accident a ''very serious incident.''
  ''We will not rule out any possibility, but at this stage we won't speculate on any particular suggestions,'' Mr. Chan told reporters on Tuesday when asked about the possible causes of the crash. He added that an investigation was underway.
  The MTR Corporation's shares fell on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange at the start of trading Tuesday, but had recovered slightly by midmorning.
  MTR stations have emerged as a prime target of vandalism during recent protests, apparently because protesters are angry at the company for having allowed riot police officers to enter its stations and beat or round up protesters. On Sunday, protesters set up barricades and broke glass railings inside one downtown station, and set a fire outside another.
  The derailment on Tuesday morning occurred as a train entered the Hung Hom Station, which sits across the city's harbor from Hong Kong Island and is also the terminus for rail service to the Chinese mainland.
  One of the passengers, Dav Cheung, 21, said in an interview that the train had vibrated and slanted horizontally as it approached the Hung Hom platform. He said he heard a loud noise coming from beneath the train about 10 seconds before it screeched to a halt.
  ''It was like an earthquake,'' he said.
  Passengers were forced to leave the train, which was split into two sections, by walking across the tracks.
  In March, an MTR train derailed and hit another train during a test of a new signaling system. But that crash occurred in the middle of the night and neither train was carrying passengers."

President Xi Jinping on Tuesday presided  over  involving 100,000 performers as China commemorated             of             and its rapid emergence as a global power.
National Day is an important holiday in China’s political calendar and the authorities in Beijing have left little to chance: For weeks they have imposed an extensive security crackdown around the country and across the internet. 
But as much as China wants to project a vision of itself as prosperous, powerful and unified,  anti-government  to overshadow the festivities.
Mr. Xi used his speech Tuesday to say that China would “maintain the lasting prosperity and stability” of Hong Kong, but he did not address the protests convulsing the city.
Here’s a look at why Oct. 1 is so important and what is happening throughout the day. 
What Is National Day? 
The People’s Republic of China was founded on Oct. 1, 1949, after the Communist Party, led by Mao Zedong, defeated the Nationalist Party in a civil war. 
On that day, a ceremony was held in Tiananmen Square to celebrate the formation of the Central People’s Government. It included a parade by the People’s Liberation Army and an , the country’s new leader, from the nearby Gate of Heavenly Peace. 
Tuesday’s ceremony, like those of the past seven decades, echoed the pageantry of that first National Day. Mr. Xi  oversaw a military parade after delivering a speech. For many Chinese people, it is a day of patriotic celebration that is followed by a weeklong holiday. 
What Happened in Beijing?
The military was showing off new weapons, including an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the United States; supersonic drones; and tanks and planes. 
Mr. Xi, the most powerful Chinese leader in decades, used his opening speech before the parade to highlight the Communist Party’s role in “the advance of the Chinese people and Chinese nation.”
The party is hoping that the fanfare and fireworks in Beijing overshadow the fury and firebombs expected in the streets of Hong Kong. 
A Holiday Crackdown
Ahead of the holiday, the authorities took  measures around the country, but , to ensure the festivities are not disrupted. 
The area around Tiananmen Square was on lockdown, and residents who live on nearby streets were told to remain at home. Passenger trains underwent security checks and all unauthorized flying objects — including racing pigeons — were banned. 
But the authorities also policed cyberspace. Internet access in the city was throttled and Weibo, the popular microblogging site, said it was deleting content that “distorts” or “insults” Chinese history. 
Protests in Hong Kong 
National Day is a holiday in Hong Kong too, and workers and students who have the day off are expected to hold anti-government protests. 
Pro-democracy protests have been a mainstay of National Day commemorations ever since the former British colony returned to Chinese control in 1997. But this year is different. 
The protests have forced the city&#39;s government to  over its famed Victoria Harbor. The government also did away with a public viewing area for a flag-raising ceremony on Tuesday morning.

Protest organizers hope that a large turnout on the streets on Tuesday will force the world’s attention away from Beijing and onto Hong Kong, and have called on residents to wear black and participate in a march through the city’s center. "

HONG KONG — Several thousand demonstrators gathered in the streets of a Hong Kong border town on Saturday to protest against mainland Chinese traders, the latest effort by local activists to ride the momentum of recent mass protests in the city.
What began as a peaceful protest on Saturday in Sheung Shui, an area of Hong Kong close to the border with mainland China, devolved into clashes between demonstrators armed with umbrellas and police officers wielding batons, pepper spray and shields.
Several protesters were seen being treated for injuries at the scene.
The march in Sheung Shui was the latest in a series of demonstrations that have plunged the former British colony into its  since it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

Demonstrators say Mrs. Lam’s steadfast refusal to completely retract the bill in the face of widespread opposition has undermined public trust in her leadership, fueling growing calls for her resignation. In recent weeks, protesters have also broadened their demands to include a             in the city.
The flourishing movement has given new energy to activists in border towns like Sheung Shui who have  against the impact of the growing numbers of tourists and visitors from mainland China.
On Saturday, many shops in Sheung Shui were shuttered as protesters marched through the streets shouting slogans like “Reclaim Sheung Shui” and “Give us back our community!” while demanding the withdrawal of the extradition bill and Mrs. Lam’s resignation.
Many of the protesters were residents angry with the vast numbers of so-called parallel traders who come across the border from the mainland to buy items like baby formula and diapers for resale at a markup in China to evade import taxes. Local residents say the retail boom has pushed up commercial rents and forced businesses aimed at residents to relocate or close.
In recent weeks, some protesters have voiced concerns that the movement’s growing demands could impact their ability to channel public support and sustain momentum. But on Saturday, several residents said that the disparate demands were in fact related to a single issue.
“People say it’s a different issue, one is a local problem, the other is citywide, but the root of it is rather the same,” said Gary Law, 32, a primary-school teacher who grew up in Sheung Shui. “It’s mostly about China.”
Over the years, the community protests have at times taken on a nativist strain. Last fall, activists led , which saw a large influx of mainland tourists after a sea bridge linked the city with Macau and mainland China. Activists sought to portray the tourists as “invaders” and used bullhorns to shout at visitors they accused of being “uncivilized.”
Last weekend, thousands of protesters rallied in the Hong Kong neighborhood of Tuen Mun against a group of middle-aged mainland women who they accused of causing a disturbance in the local park with loud singing and provocative dancing. As the protesters closed in, one woman from mainland China fled and took refuge in a public toilet for several hours before the police came to escort her away, according to .
That nativist tone was evident once again at the protest on Saturday, which drew a smaller, mostly local crowd compared with previous protests in the city’s main financial district.
“I want to tell those people who trade parallel goods that we Hong Kong people actually do not like what they’ve been doing, and that they have invaded our daily life and affected Hong Kong,” said Cecilia Hui, 26, a resident of Sheung Shui.
Other protesters, however, sought to keep the focus on the larger movement. Many more people are expected to turn out on Sunday for a planned protest in Sha Tin in Hong Kong’s New Territories region.
“We have asked the government for a response, but every time they refuse to give a solid response,” said Karina Chan, 33. “That’s why we have kept up these protests and these peaceful actions — to let the public know that we still have the patience to wait for the government to respond.”

The New York Times ,2019-08-01,Next to Protest Against Hong Kong _s Government_ Its Employees,1364 ,"
HONG KONG — This summer, Hong Kong has seen  by students, teachers, parents, lawyers, doctors, nurses, social workers, seniors and finance workers. On Friday, members of one prominent group that has not yet collectively taken to the streets are expected to join them: professionals within the government itself.
The action by members of the civil service — scheduled to be a two-hour gathering after work in a downtown park — is likely to be one of the more placid protests in this former British colony. But it could also be a powerful one, showing that public discontent with Hong Kong’s leaders is shared by at least some of the people who serve under them.
It comes as the government, led by Chief Executive Carrie Lam, is facing pressure from Beijing to restore order, in light of increasingly frequent clashes between demonstrators and the police. This week, the People’s Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong released a promotional video pledging to defend Chinese sovereignty in the semiautonomous territory, with  in a drill.
The planned demonstration by city employees has raised questions about whether such an action would violate the civil service’s restrictions against public engagement in politics, and how it might affect the service’s reputation as one of the region’s most effective bureaucracies. In a message sent Thursday to all civil servants, the official who oversees them, Joshua Law, said he “absolutely” did not approve of such a demonstration.
""This is unprecedented,” said John P. Burns, an emeritus professor at the University of Hong Kong who has studied the civil service. “The very fact they are physically coming together in one place is one thing. But I think they’ve already done what they need to do, and that’s issue a statement.”
In recent days, several groups of civil servants appear to have called on the government — anonymously — to address protesters’ concerns. In petitions and open letters on social media, hundreds have indicated their endorsement by sharing photos of their civil service staff cards, with their names covered.
Last week, more than 100 of the city’s roughly 700 administrative officers, an elite level of policymaker, apparently endorsed a letter calling for an independent investigation into issues surrounding the protests — including , and the reasons for the police’s failure to stop it.
Among other issues, the letter also called for an investigation into the process by which Mrs. Lam’s government introduced a now-suspended bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China, the issue that set off the demonstrations.
“If we do not face the root of the problem, we are not only disregarding our mission to serve the public, it would also be impossible to steer Hong Kong back onto the right track,” .
Another letter endorsed by self-identified civil servants, numbering more than 200, threatened “” if “the government continues to ignore public opinion.” Staff members from the Hong Kong Department of Justice’s prosecutions division appeared to endorse a letter criticizing the department’s leadership and calling for an investigation of the mob attack, in the satellite town of Yuen Long.
And a letter attributed to firefighters and paramedics  to the mob attack. No officers intervened as the mob, of men dressed in white shirts and carrying sticks, beat people indiscriminately; no arrests were initially made, and some of those since detained are suspected of ties to criminal gangs known as triads, which have a history of being hired to carry out political violence.
The Law Society, a lawyers’ organization that usually takes pro-establishment positions,  into the growing political crisis on Thursday.
One Hong Kong civil servant, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation at work, said she and many of her colleagues were angered that the police, while taking swift action against antigovernment protesters, had done nothing to stop a mob from beating some of those same demonstrators. She said the public was losing its trust in the government, which was affecting their work.
Michael Ngan, a Labor Department officer who filed the application to hold the Friday protest, told the public broadcaster RTHK that he considered it a display of responsiveness to public concerns.
“We are not organizing a resistance, nor are we standing in opposition to the government,” he said. “We want to send a message to the public that civil servants can hear your voices and are willing to share them with the government, thereby repairing the relationship between the government and the people.”
Mr. Ngan and other organizers of the Friday protest declined requests for interviews. Some said they had been deluged with harassing phone calls.
Mr. Law, the head of the civil service, said in his internal memo on Thursday that “civil servants must remain politically neutral,” though he did not explicitly threaten to punish employees who participated in the demonstration on Friday. He said “outside parties” could “have misconceptions that the civil service is in opposition with the government.”
The government issued a statement later Thursday saying that “acts to undermine the principle of political neutrality of the civil service are totally unacceptable.”
Some civil servants have said that they plan to participate in a general strike that protest organizers are encouraging people across the city to join on Monday.
Mr. Ngan told RTHK that the tone of the gathering Friday would be rational. He said he intended to invite Mrs. Lam, the chief executive, or another senior official to address their concerns.
Mrs. Lam is a career civil servant, as are almost all of her chief ministers. She can be stern in interviews and public appearances, but she often speaks warmly of the bureaucracy, and the protest and public letters have served as stark notice that such sentiments are not always reciprocated.
According to their code of conduct, Hong Kong’s civil servants, of whom there are about 180,000, are required to be loyal to the city’s leaders and keep private any personal views that contradict the government’s decisions.
“Once a decision has been taken by the administration, civil servants should support and implement the decision fully and faithfully irrespective of their personal preferences and should not make known their own views in public,” the then-head of the civil service . A memo updated in 2015 said that civil servants were not prohibited from joining political organizations or activities that do not conflict with their official duties.
Scholars and civil servants could think of no similar protest in recent decades. But in the 1970s, after Hong Kong began an aggressive campaign against police corruption, some officers protested, saying they were being too harshly targeted.
In 1977, after a series of demonstrations, dozens of officers stormed the headquarters of an antigraft body, the Independent Commission Against Corruption. As a result, Murray MacLehose, then Hong Kong’s colonial governor, issued a partial amnesty for past police corruption.
What punishments, if any, civil servants who participate in a protest on Friday would face could be a matter for their immediate superiors. But Professor Burns said the reputation of the civil service in general was likely to be unscathed.
“We have a group of civil servants saying we think this is what’s called for,” he said. “I think the community will be happy for that.”

The New York Times ,2019-10-05,An Eerie Quiet and Dread as Hong Kong Face-Mask Ban Takes Effect,1330 ,"
After a night of arson and vandalism, the financial hub braces for more unrest and ponders the future with anxiety. 
HONG KONG — With its subways paralyzed and its shopping malls shuttered, Hong Kong was anxious and eerily quiet on Saturday. 
The city was taking a breather from a night of unrest that erupted after Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, invoked emergency powers to quell antigovernment protests that have grown increasingly violent. 
The unexpected tranquillity masked a palpable sense of anger and dread that has swept the city since Mrs. Lam announced on Friday that she would draw on a colonial-era law to ban face masks during street rallies. 
The government&#39;s decision was ostensibly designed to dissuade moderate Hong Kongers from joining the demonstrations roiling this semiautonomous Chinese territory. But the turn to emergency powers that allow Mrs. Lam to pass rules without having to go through the legislature immediately  the city has seen in recent months. 
The clashes raised the prospect that the unrest might further escalate in the coming days, testing the limits of the territory’s already strained economy and the .
On a deeper level, the move has triggered concerns that the government would take further steps to  that have long differentiated Hong Kong from the rest of China and helped turn the city into an international trade and finance powerhouse. The government hopes the ban will deter the protesters from resorting to violence, but to many it represents a turning point that could fundamentally change             and would only inflame tensions more.
“How can we move on when there are such intense and deep-rooted divisions within our society?” said Wendy Ng, a 44-year-old part-time cooking instructor who was staying home on Saturday because the authorities had shut down the subway network. “The mask ban is making it worse, can’t they see?” 
“If the government does not make further concessions,” she added, “it’s over for this city, both for us and for those government officials who think of themselves as all-powerful.”
The ban announced Friday targets the face masks that protesters use to conceal their identities, but Mrs. Lam could, if she deemed necessary later, use the emergency powers to impose a curfew or empower the police to search phones more easily without warrants, among other measures. 
Many in the protest movement see the move against face masks as a de facto ban on their right to protest and believe it would antagonize those already enraged by the leadership’s refusal to grant them the free elections and other demands they have been pressing since the protests began in June. 
“It will only make people more furious with the government,” said Lam Cheuk-ting, a pro-democracy lawmaker in Hong Kong’s legislative body. The ban, he said, would have little impact on the growing number of young protesters willing — and often eager — to confront the armed riot police. 
“I fear that Hong Kong’s situation will only go from bad to worse,” he said.
On Saturday afternoon, several hundred demonstrators gathered in central Hong Kong, but most of the city was calm as people remained close to home and an earlier call for mass gatherings evaporated when it became apparent that moving about the city would be difficult. 
Nearly all of the city’s subway lines have been closed since Friday evening after the protesters smashed windows and set fires at subway stations. Transit officials blamed the move on the need to repair damage by vandals but it was seen by some as at least in part aimed at heading off large protests. 
Like many of those who marched through the streets of the city’s Wan Chai neighborhood on Saturday, Clare Fok, 43, a cosmetics sales clerk, made a point of concealing her face. 
“I’ve never worn masks to marches before because they’re stuffy and I’m beautiful,” Ms. Fok said cheekily through a swatch of gray fabric, a pair of aviator sunglasses hiding her eyes. “We are deliberately wearing masks today because we can’t accept the ban. They’re taking away our freedoms, and we won’t just obey because they tell us to.”
In a televised speech Saturday, Mrs. Lam condemned the protesters who rampaged through neighborhoods across the city on Friday night, destroying traffic lights, spray-painting ATMs and damaging state-owned Chinese businesses — or those whose owners are widely seen as hostile to the protest movement. 
The violence and destruction, she said, only reinforced her decision to invoke the emergency ordinance. 
“The extreme acts of the rioters brought dark hours to Hong Kong last night and half paralyzed society today,” she said grimly. “Everyone is worried, anxious and even in fear.”
The face-mask ban, which went into effect early Saturday, carries a maximum jail sentence of one year and a $3,200 fine. So far, the police appear to have largely taken a hands-off approach to those defying the measure. 
Samson Yuen, a political scientist at Lingnan University, said he thought the measure would be counterproductive. 
“The government has turned the simple face mask into a protest symbol,” he said. “By using the emergency laws, they are pouring fuel on the fire.” 
The protests began four months ago in  that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to the mainland, but they have steadily grown more combative and dangerous. On Friday night, a 14-year-old boy was hit in the leg by a gunshot. The police said Saturday that the teenager, who was in stable condition, had been arrested for rioting and assaulting police officers. 
Earlier in the week, a police officer shot and critically  who had charged at him. It was the first time the police used live fire to subdue a protester. 
The shooting added to the sense of urgency among Hong Kong’s leaders, prompting them to embrace the contentious face-mask ban.
Nearly everyone in this city of seven million was affected by the transit shutdown that has marred what is a three-day holiday weekend. Many shops, banks and restaurants were also closed, and nearly all the city’s ubiquitous 7-Eleven convenience stores pulled down their gates at 5 p.m. When the city’s high-speed train to the airport was briefly suspended, anxious tourists scrambled to find scarce taxis and Ubers.
Some blamed the protesters themselves for the inconveniences. 
Joining a crush of hundreds awaiting buses, Sarah Wong, who works in sales, said she was generally sympathetic to the protesters’ demands but was upset by their use of vandalism and violence. 
“They can ask for freedom, but they shouldn’t inconvenience other people,” said Ms. Wong, who complained about being forced to cancel an appointment with her hair dresser.
With more protests scheduled for Sunday, the sense of foreboding was inescapable across much of the city. 
In Statue Square, a plaza in the historic heart of Hong Kong, Alice Ng, 31, joined other masked protesters who laughed and cheered as a man climbed on a bronze figure of Sir Thomas Jackson, a 19th-century British banker, and covered his head with one of the plastic helmets that have become indispensable for those who audaciously confront the police and their tear-gas canisters. 
A few minutes later, the mood changed when riot police officers charged into the plaza, briefly detained two people who wore masks and searched their backpacks. They also took a man who was wearing a bandanna over his face to a police vehicle.
“Daytime protests are peaceful,” Ms. Ng, an interior designer, said as the sun began to set. “But at night, it&#39;s a different story.”

The New York Times,2019-08-13,The Other Battle for Hong Kong,1019 ,"
How Beijing is weaponizing social media in its fight to crush the Hong Kong protests.
MELBOURNE, Australia  -- As the police deploy tear gas against protesters on the streets of Hong Kong, another battle is raging less visibly: the one for narrative control. After weeks of asserting that the unrest had been orchestrated by foreign ''black hands,'' Chinese officials on Monday accused protesters of showing the first signs of ''terrorism.'' Such messaging is key to Beijing's public opinion operation, which has been turned up to full volume. 
  The weapons of this information war include a flood of social media posts from state-run media, some carrying misinformation. When a woman dispensing first aid was shot in the eye by the Hong Kong police, the state-run CCTV reported on its official social media account that she had been shot by protesters. It also accused her of handing out money to demonstrators. Chinese readers are unlikely to question the veracity of such an authoritative source, and CCTV's Weibo post, which says the movement is slandering the Hong Kong police by blaming them for the injury, has been liked more than 700,000 times.
  Ten weeks ago, when Hong Kongers first took to the streets to protest disputed extradition legislation, Beijing censored all reports of this civil unrest. But in recent days, it has reveled in posting video of protesters purportedly using air guns, slingshots and petrol bombs against the police. The state-run Global Times has described protesters as ''nothing more than street thugs who want Hong Kong to 'go to hell,''' or as people who had ''voluntarily stripped themselves of their national identity.'' Such descriptions are aimed at delegitimizing the protesters' cause, especially among educated mainlanders who might otherwise be sympathetic.
  Chinese people living or studying overseas are another important audience for Beijing's messaging. Their primary news diet is largely delivered via WeChat, a Chinese chat app where messages are subject to censorship, so they often still fall within Beijing's propaganda orbit. Recent pictures of an American diplomat meeting two activists, Joshua Wong and Nathan Law, were used to bolster Beijing's claims of hostile foreign forces backing the protests. On Tuesday, scenes of a Chinese state media worker being tied up at the airport and beaten by young protesters flooded Chinese social media, bolstering calls for Beijing to intervene militarily in Hong Kong. 
  Such messaging helps to mobilize Chinese communities, especially newly arrived migrants in Australia, Canada, the United States and elsewhere, to support the official line from Beijing. One website for a planned protest this weekend in Sydney asks Chinese to stand together against ''rioting'' in Hong Kong, which it said was causing discrimination against Chinese in Australia.
  The battle over Hong Kong is, in effect, being exported, pitting overseas Chinese communities against each other. Over the past few weeks, ''Lennon Walls,'' covered in colorful Post-it notes expressing support for Hong Kong, have been torn down by supporters of Beijing from Auckland, New Zealand, to Vancouver, British Columbia, and from Hobart, Australia, to Harvard Square. After a violent tussle between pro-China and pro-Hong Kong students in late July at the University of Queensland in Australia, the Chinese consul-general in Brisbane, Xu Jie, issued a statement praising the ''spontaneous patriotic behavior of Chinese students.'' 
  One reason this conflict is playing out on social media is that almost all of Hong Kong's big media companies are owned by mainland business executives or groups with extensive business interests in China, so they have instinctively taken a pro-Beijing stance. This has left digital news outlets and the overseas media as the front line in the battle for public opinion. People trying to livestream the protests and foreign media are apparently already being targeted by the police. In recent weeks, a BBC journalist was saved from injury only by his face mask, which shattered when the police shot directly at his head. Another reporter wearing a bright yellow press vest was crushed against a wall by three police officers. Two journalists were attacked by a gang of street thugs, and a well-known British livestreamer scratching his belly was publicly accused by a pro-Beijing politician of being a ''foreign commander'' sending hand signals to protesters. Such an accusation would be laughable had it not been so widely shared.
  To counter what they say are lies and malicious distortions, the protesters have started to hold regular news conferences, with their representatives addressing the media wearing face masks and yellow helmets. The movement's social media strategy has been to use colorful memes and videos tailored for different audiences, including large-print messages with floral backgrounds for elderly readers.
  In recent days, the state-run Chinese media has begun sharing videos showing large-scale exercises featuring the People's Armed Police, a paramilitary group, in the city of Shenzhen, over the border from Hong Kong. The same group, instead of the People's Liberation Army, was used to crack down on protests in Chengdu in 1989. Hong Kongers may dismiss these provocations as bluffing, but it is a clear sign that the information war, like the battle for Hong Kong itself, is set to escalate further.

The New York Times,2019-11-30,"In Hong Kong , Campus Siege Comes to End 2 Weeks Later",807 ,"
The police found no protesters during a final search of Polytechnic University, the site of some of the most violent clashes the city has seen this year.
HONG KONG -- The police returned control of Hong Kong Polytechnic University's campus to school officials on Friday, bringing to an end one of the most intense periods of conflict since protests began to engulf the city earlier this year.  
  The police, who arrested hundreds of people during their two-week siege of the campus, said they found no protesters there during a final search on Friday morning. Investigators found nearly 4,000 firebombs on the campus over the past two days, as well as other explosive items and bottles of corrosive liquids, the police said.
  The siege, which was punctuated by days of clashes between the police and protesters, ended quietly as university officials resumed control of the shattered campus on the southeastern side of the Kowloon Peninsula.
  There will not be ''any ceremony or event to shake hands or stuff like that,'' Chow Yat-ming, an assistant police commissioner, said Friday morning before officers left the campus.
  The protests began in June over legislation, since withdrawn, that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China. It has continued over other issues, including calls for expanded elections and an investigation into the police's use of force.
  Hong Kong universities became the centers of especially large protests this month after the death of a student, Chow Tsz-lok, who fell from a parking garage during a police operation.
  The Chinese University of Hong Kong was occupied by protesters for five days in mid-November, and several other schools saw large demonstrations. Many campuses cut their semesters short because of the unrest.
  At Polytechnic University, students who took up their protest there on Nov. 11 were later joined by militant demonstrators who were determined to keep the police out, fortifying their position with firebombs, bricks and large slingshots. On Nov. 17, the police threatened to use lethal force against the demonstrators and warned that those caught could be charged with rioting, which can carry a lengthy prison sentence.
  Protesters also set fire to tollbooths near the campus, leading to the two-week closure of a major tunnel linking the Kowloon Peninsula with Hong Kong Island.
  Polytechnic University and the streets around it saw large-scale clashes between riot police officers and protesters who were trying to help others flee the besieged campus. The police fired more than 1,400 tear gas rounds on Nov. 18 alone, as large numbers of protesters tried to break through the police cordon around the school.
  Protesters hurled bricks and firebombs at the police, and at one point an armored police vehicle was engulfed in flames. One officer was hit in the leg with an arrow.
  Some protesters managed to escape the campus by jumping fences when the police were not watching. In one dramatic moment, a few rappelled onto a roadway and were taken away by people on motorcycles. Others tried but failed to escape through sewers.
  ''I felt anxious and powerless back then, because some of my friends were stuck inside and I didn't how I could help those detained there,'' Ernest Ho, a 24-year-old student at City University of Hong Kong, said Friday. ''We also didn't know what would happen inside, as we couldn't contact them very easily. 
  ''I felt depressed when they tried to escape,'' he said. ''They fled as if they were refugees. However, they are Hong Kong people.''
  University officials said Friday that the campus was still unsafe, despite the removal of dangerous materials, and that it would remain closed until further notice.
  A police spokesman, Kwok Ka-chuen, said 1,377 people had been arrested during the siege of the campus. Citywide, more than 5,800 people have been arrested in connection with the protests since early June, according to the police.
  The protests quieted dramatically in the days before Sunday, when elections were held for district councils across the city. Pro-democracy candidates dominated the vote, which had been seen as a referendum on the protest movement, taking 87 percent of the seats. 
  On Wednesday, President Trump signed legislation that authorized sanctions on officials deemed responsible for human rights violations in Hong Kong. Demonstrators in Hong Kong celebrated that legislation with a peaceful gathering Thursday night.
  In the Central district, where in recent weeks office workers and others have held lunch-hour demonstrations in support of the protest movement, hundreds of people gathered around midday Friday and spilled onto the roads. Police officers fired pepper spray and arrested one man, the public broadcaster RTHK reported.

The New York Times ,2019-08-28,Chinese Military Sends New Troops Into Hong Kong,992 ,"
HONG KONG — The Chinese military began sending a new group of troops into Hong Kong on Thursday, a move it described as a normal annual rotation of its garrison in the city, but one that was being closely watched because of the local political turmoil.
The move came hours before two organizers of the protests that have roiled the city said they were attacked, in separate incidents, by men with makeshift weapons, one in a restaurant and the other while giving an interview on a sidewalk. Also Thursday, the police denied a protest group permission to hold another large march through the city this weekend.

“This rotation is an annual normal routine action approved by the Central Military Commission,” Lt. Col.

 since the handover, with near-daily protests against the government, including some that have turned violent, with demonstrators throwing stones and even firebombs at police. On Sunday, an officer fired a warning shot as a group of protesters with sticks and metal poles charged a group of police officers.
The police on Thursday denied demonstrators permission to hold a large march on Saturday, to mark the fifth anniversary of  on a promised expansion of direct elections in Hong Kong. That move led to large-scale protests in the autumn of 2014 that became known as the Umbrella Movement. Organizers of the proposed Saturday march said they would appeal the police’s decision.
One of the organizers, Jimmy Sham, said he was attacked on Thursday afternoon at a restaurant in the Kowloon area by two men, armed with a baseball bat and a cleaver. Mr. Sham said he was not injured, but that a friend who protected him was struck on the arm.
Hours later, Max Chung, another protest organizer, said he had also been attacked. He said four men began hitting him with umbrellas and metal bars as he met with journalists from a local online news organization. The news outlet, Truth Media Hong Kong,  showing injuries to his back, neck and arms.

This summer’s protests began over legislation, since suspended, that would allow extraditions to mainland China. Many in Hong Kong feared the bill would further increase Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory that has its own courts and local government and greater protection for civil liberties than the rest of the country.
The protesters’ demands have expanded to include a full withdrawal of the extradition bill, an investigation into allegations of excessive use of force by the police and expanded direct elections, the issue that drove the Umbrella Movement protests in 2014.
The Saturday march was proposed by the Civil Human Rights Front, a group that has organized several enormous demonstrations this summer,  this summer’s wave of protests.
Many protesters made it clear on social media that they planned to march Saturday regardless of whether they were authorized to do so. The police banned a march organized by the Civil Human Rights Front two weeks ago, but  in defiance, a sign of the movement&#39;s continuing strength and the demonstrators’ increasing disregard for official prohibitions.
The route proposed for Saturday’s march goes from the Central district to the Chinese government’s representative office, known as the liaison office, in the northwestern part of Hong Kong Island. That office was vandalized by protesters last month, leading to vehement denunciations from China.
The liaison office has since put a plastic shield around the national crest that hangs outside the building, which protesters had spattered with ink. In recent weeks, the police have fired several rounds of tear gas to keep protesters from approaching the office.
In explaining their decision to ban the Saturday march, the police said that more than 20 protests since early June had ended in acts of violence, including people throwing bricks and lighting fires.

The event, which was billed as a campaign event for local elections, quickly descended into chaos around the city.
HONG KONG — Police officers in Hong Kong on Saturday fired tear gas and clashed with protesters around the city, capping 21 weeks of antigovernment demonstrations that have convulsed this international financial hub and helped to .
In scenes throughout the night that have become part of the new normal in Hong Kong, the city’s central financial district and several dense commercial neighborhoods were enveloped in shrouds of tear gas as riot police battled with protesters, who wore masks in defiance of a  enacted last month. Earlier in the afternoon, police shut down two rallies in the Central district that had received official authorization, citing the clashes elsewhere.
The day began when several thousand protesters turned out for a rally at Victoria Park in Causeway Bay. It had been billed as a campaign event for Hong Kong’s upcoming district council elections, after the police rejected the organizers’ initial application to hold a demonstration. (Police permission is not always required for election events.)
Here’s the latest on the Hong Kong protests.
Chaos Returns to Streets of Hong Kong
The mood was tense from the beginning, as police quickly declared the Victoria Park rally an unauthorized assembly and tried to disperse protesters using tear gas, pepper spray and water cannons. Later, as the police continued their dispersal efforts, some protesters responded by throwing petroleum bombs, vandalizing metro stations and shops seen as sympathetic to the Chinese government, spraying graffiti and building barricades on streets.For the first time, protesters also targeted the offices of Xinhua, China’s state-run news agency.
Dozens of protesters were detained, adding to the more than 2,800 who have been arrested since the movement began. Two pro-democracy election candidates, Osman Cheng and Richard Chan, were seen being taken away by the police.
Court Blocks Online Messages That ‘Incite Violence’
A Hong Kong court on Friday  a government request to temporarily bar anyone from “disseminating, circulating, publishing or republishing” information that “promotes, encourages or incites the use or threat of violence.”
The order specifically cited Telegram, a messaging app, and LIHKG, a Reddit-like messaging forum. Both are widely used by demonstrators to organize protests.
The ban came one week after another court barred  from harassing police officers, including taking their photos while on duty or posting their personal details online.
Beijing Signals Renewed Push for ‘Patriotic Education’
Chinese Communist Party leaders who met in Beijing during the past week signaled that they were exploring a tougher approach to the unrest in Hong Kong. Mainland officials renewed a call for “” in the territory, aimed at fostering greater loyalty to China.
Shen Chunyao, the head of a central government committee that oversees policy in Hong Kong, also indicated that Beijing might revise how the top official in Hong Kong, called the chief executive, is appointed. He confirmed that the Chinese government was considering  to “safeguard national security” in Hong Kong.
Candidates Seek to Convert Public Anger Into Votes
The demonstration on Saturday in Victoria Park was an unusual combination of protest and election rally. Candidates for district council carried banners and wore sashes bearing their names; they talked with potential voters as thousands of people dressed in black milled about.
“There are many ways to struggle and fight back against the government, from inside the institutions and outside the institutions,” said Sam Cheung, 26, a university tutor and district council candidate from the Tuen Mun area in northern Hong Kong.
The elections, scheduled for Nov. 24, will test the protest movement’s ability to take advantage of its momentum to gain institutional influence. That effort suffered a blow this past week when a government official  Joshua Wong, a prominent activist, from running in the district council race.

HONG KONG — Fat Boy is a college dropout with a youthful blush of acne who excels at playing video games and lives with his mother. He is also a wily commander who leads a ragtag band of protesters willing to risk injury and arrest as they face off against the police.
Fat Boy oversees 50 or so , ages 15 to 35, who focus their attacks on the police, government offices and Chinese-owned banks or other             to their movement. Their weapons — bricks, poles and Molotov cocktails — are often met with            . Occasionally, the police have responded with            .
They are part of a core of combative young agitators, garbed in black, who have come to define the  that have convulsed this semiautonomous territory for more than four months and that have posed a bold challenge to the authority of China’s ruling Communist Party.
“You have to earn your rights and freedom,” Fat Boy, 20, said one afternoon this month at his apartment as he and three team members picked at takeout food and talked about their anxieties and aspirations. “For this, we can have no regrets.”
With a self-confidence that frequently veered to bravado, he showed off  from the day he hot-wired an excavator at a construction site and drove it to the entrance of a police station. 
“After I did that, other people copied me,” he said.
The protesters have escalated their use of violent tactics, smashing storefronts, setting bonfires at subway stations and . 
On Oct. 13, a protester  in the throat with a box cutter, leaving him in serious condition. The same day, a             detonated by cellphone exploded in a sidewalk planter, though it caused no damage or injuries. 
The police warned that the political movement had entered a dangerous new phase.
Hard-line protesters and the authorities are locked in an  that feels as if it is edging closer to a fatality or perhaps even an intervention by Chinese troops that could further endanger the civil liberties long enjoyed by the territory’s seven million residents.
The protesters say they have been driven to extremes by a government that won’t meet  for greater democracy and an investigation into police conduct. The authorities refuse partly because they believe further concessions would only encourage more violence. 
Francis Lee, a journalism professor at the  who has conducted             on the unrest, said the police and protesters were trapped in a vicious cycle of surging violence. 
“We have reached a stage where it is difficult for either side to escalate their actions without creating backlash,” he said.
The city’s leaders and the police, seeking to drive a wedge between the front-line protesters and the broader public, have cast the demonstrators as rioters and violent vigilantes. Moderates who support the movement’s goals express a growing fear that the violence plays into Beijing’s hands and will undermine public support. 
For now, Hong Kong’s residents continue to back the protests by wide margins despite the violence, said Professor Lee, whose polling suggests that at least creating an independent commission on police conduct would go a long way toward defusing the crisis.
“These demands are not radical at all,” he said. “Doing them is very likely to be adequate to kick-start a process of de-escalation.”
Fat Boy, his three teammates and one other front-line protester agreed to be interviewed  on the condition that they be identified by nicknames or first names only, for fear of being arrested. 
The teammates include Jeff, a 24-year-old musician and skateboarder who quit his full-time job renovating apartments to devote himself to the protest movement; Kitty, a 21-year-old English major who recently left school for the same reason; and Tyler, 34, a construction manager who supports the brigade by supplying the helmets and carbon fiber shields that protect its members during confrontations with the police.
They said they wanted to push back against the Hong Kong government’s narrative likening them to thugs and mainland China’s propaganda that describes them as separatists. Their goals: to seek police accountability and secure the universal suffrage that they say Beijing promised when this former British colony was returned to China in 1997.
Like many Hong Kong youths, the front-line protesters assert an identity that, unlike in generations past, is . 
Their anger is rooted in a growing sense that China’s Communist Party has worked swiftly to , and as examples they point to the             and             by the mainland authorities. 
Samuel, 24, a freckle-faced protester and aspiring songwriter who is not part of Fat Boy’s group, explained, “We just don’t want to become like those Chinese who have become accustomed to living without freedom.” 
During protests, Samuel erects roadblocks to slow down advancing columns of officers. He and the others defended their tactics and said they were being driven by mounting police brutality and an inflexible government. 
A few of the democracy advocates conceded that the homemade bomb gave them pause.
Longhaired, lanky and contemplative, Jeff, the musician, equivocated when asked whether he approved of the bombing. He said that he didn’t think he could use such a weapon but that he might reconsider if its sole aim was to sow chaos and disperse charging police officers.
“I used to be someone who wouldn’t even throw a brick,” he said. “But every time I encounter an escalation by the police, my limit goes higher.”
With their gas masks and sleek, ninjalike attire, the front-liners are an unmistakable presence during demonstrations. They have adopted the martial arts hero Bruce Lee’s ruminations on flexibility in the face of obstacles — “” — saying they should behave like a wave that appears at once to pound the enemy and then promptly recedes into countless drops that cannot be contained.
They coordinate moves on encrypted messaging apps and are aided by four tacticians on three continents who remotely monitor the street battles.
It is impossible to know the number of antigovernment protesters who have embraced a more violent approach, but Fat Boy says he is aware of as many as 30 groups whose leaders meet face to face once or twice a month. The groups operate autonomously, with infrequent contact, an arrangement that helps protect them from arrest.
Fat Boy and those who direct the activities of the other groups are the closest thing to commanders in a movement largely characterized by the absence of readily identifiable leaders.
“It would be dangerous to talk to each other,” he said. “If one gets caught, all of us get caught.”
So far, the police have arrested around 2,700 people, though most have been released on bail. About 200 could face 10 years in prison on charges of rioting. Roughly a third of them are under 18, and 100 of them are under 16. 
Many of Fat Boy’s claims could not be independently verified, but his mother and the three front-liners on his team corroborated much of what he said. 
He has named his team Hogwarts, after the mythical school of wizardry in the Harry Potter series, and says his group was one of the first to use Molotov cocktails, a weapon that was quickly embraced by other front-line protesters as a way to slow the advance of the riot police. 
His team has been especially busy this fall. On Sept. 29, two days before National Day celebrations in China, several team members set fire to a subway station entrance, producing huge plumes of black smoke and drawing a battalion of firefighters. 
On Oct. 1, they donned Guy Fawkes masks, burned paper portraits of China’s president, Xi Jinping, near military barracks and quickly vanished. 
At first glance, Fat Boy is hardly menacing. He shuffles around his mother’s luxury apartment in slippers, toggling between cable news channels and video games like Red Dead Redemption. He rarely sleeps more than a few hours each night.
“I’m mentally and physically exhausted,” he said. “I think the police are tired too.”
As he spoke, Fat Boy’s mother cleaned up the apartment while Jeff and Kitty cuddled on the sofa — their romance began at a protest this summer. 
Fat Boy’s mother was once largely apolitical but now attends the protests, handing out food and tending to those overcome by pepper spray or tear gas.
“Every time he goes out, I worry he and his friends will get hurt, or that they might not come home at all,” she said, wringing her hands. 
Fat Boy said that his schooling influenced his political awakening. He attended an elite Hong Kong academy that he described as pro-China. It sent him and his classmates to the mainland for a week of military training, where he learned the value of leadership and how to fire a gun. 
He later went to school in Canada, where he gained an appreciation for Western-style democracy and civil liberties. He is also well versed in military history and especially World War II, which he says taught him the importance of standing up to tyranny.
Fat Boy’s evolution from peaceful demonstrator to firebomb-throwing provocateur mirrors that of other combative protesters. 
On June 9, he joined a  who took to the streets in the very first protest against             that would have allowed residents to be extradited to mainland China. Fat Boy and many others were infuriated after the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, said the            , driving home the idea that peaceful demonstrations were useless. 
Three days later, on June 12, he joined  in surrounding the legislative complex to block debate about the bill. A core group lobbed umbrellas and bricks at the police, who responded with what            , beating protesters with batons and dousing them with pepper spray and plumes of tear gas. 
“On June 9, I was just a guy passing out fliers on the street. By June 12, I had 100 people at my side,” he said, referring to the confrontational core of protesters. 
To prevent infiltration by undercover officers, Fat Boy scrutinizes the social media accounts of new recruits. So far, he said, only five or six of his members have been arrested, all of them during street fights with the police.
Their support network includes Hong Kongers in Canada, Australia and Britain who help coordinate attacks on the police, he said. Studying protester chat groups and the live feeds from videographers on the ground, these remote tacticians can direct the front-liners — and help guide their retreat. 
As he spoke, the rest of the crew was entranced by a particularly graphic video game that Fat Boy was playing on a large-screen TV. His mother winced as a Wild West gunslinger lassoed a man and dragged him to his death.
“It’s so realistic,” she said.
Fat Boy seemed to appreciate the moment’s irony and briefly put down the controls.
“Now it’s like we are playing a video game on the street,” he said with a sigh. “Except it’s real, and it’s not fun.”

The New York Times ,2019-06-25,A Rush to the Street as Protesters Worldwide See Democracies Backsliding,1447 ,"
It seems that 2019 might be the year of the protest.
In Prague last week, Czechs gathered in  since the fall of the Iron Curtain to demand the resignation of their prime minister over corruption accusations.
Not two weeks earlier, around a million people against a law that would permit extradition to mainland China, forcing the government to back down.
In Kazakhstan,  have led to thousands of arrests. And in Algeria,             in April after protests;             a few days later.
The motives for each uprising are unique. But experts say there is reason to believe they are also manifestations of a global trend in which masses of ordinary citizens are demanding more accountability from those in power.
“Since about 2010, we have seen a seeming rise in mobilization among people who don’t normally mobilize,” said Helen Margetts, a professor at Oxford University and co-author of  on social media and political protests. That includes “young people, people from ethnic minorities and people in authoritarian states,” she said.
One reason, research suggests, is that global political shifts have created increased expectations of democratic accountability — even in autocracies — at the same time that authoritarianism is on the rise around the world.
Those two trends are colliding, giving citizens more to object to just as they increasingly feel entitled to object. Also, rising distrust of political establishments is leaving many citizens wary, even in democracies, of relying on the ballot box alone. Instead, they are taking to the streets.
And because social media has made it far easier to mobilize public sentiment and organize mass action, thwarted expectations are quicker than ever to transform into large demonstrations — but perhaps more vulnerable than ever to falling apart before their goals are secured. That can create a self-reinforcing cycle of protest and instability.
Great Expectations
Since the end of the Cold War, “everyone has to claim to be a democracy,” said Milan Svolik, a Yale professor who studies democratization and democratic backsliding.
Even in autocracies, political trends in recent decades have “increased citizen expectations that governments should be accountable to their people in meaningful ways,” two democracy experts, Thomas Carothers and Richard Youngs, wrote in a 2015  for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
But those increased expectations of accountability have not always matched reality. In many post-Soviet states, for instance, there was little incentive for leaders to reform police forces and other security institutions inherited from the Cold War days, said Erica Marat, a professor at the National Defense University who studies democracy and security in the former Soviet bloc.
The result is that some of those governments, and particularly their punitive, militarized security services, did not have mechanisms in place to meet the urban middle classes’ rising expectations of democratic accountability.
That led to protests across the region, Dr. Marat said, as people realized that joining demonstrations was one of the few avenues for making political demands.
“Mass collective action never comes out of nowhere,” she said. “There are always smaller actions against the repressive state.” These can then draw in others who are more likely to act once they see that there is public support.
In Kazakhstan, for instance, smaller protests were part of a “learning process,” Dr. Marat said, which evolved into a larger mobilization.
A similar pattern has played out in other regions as well.
In Hong Kong, although  brought large numbers of people to the streets to demand democracy, they ultimately failed to force systemic change. But, Dr. Marat believes, those demonstrations may have contributed to this month’s successful protests against the proposed extradition law.
In Sudan, there were against rising food prices, followed by a schism within Mr. al-Bashir’s own party in August over his plan to change the Constitution to run for president again. That led to a series of public protests against the government in the early months of this year, culminating in Mr. al-Bashir’s ouster in mid-April.
Populism and Backlash
The conflict between democratic expectations and rising authoritarianism is also driving protests within democracies.
Rising inequality, corruption scandals and frustration with seemingly unresponsive institutions have made the system feel less democratic to many citizens. That has led many to protest by voting in populists who promise to smash the flawed system and govern for the people.
But once in office, such leaders often crush dissent and dismantle checks and balances, concentrating power in their own hands and further exacerbating the conflict between democracy and authoritarianism. Now, that is helping drive more mass protests.
In Venezuela, for instance, Hugo Chávez was elected on a populist platform, but then he and his successor, Nicolás Maduro, stripped power from the legislature and packed the courts with allies. That left street protests as the main avenue for expressing dissent as the country suffered .
In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, once an extremely popular elected leader, embraced authoritarian methods and oversaw the dismantling of much of Turkish democracy.
Turkey has not yet seen mass mobilizations like those in Hong Kong or Prague. But this week, after Mr. Erdogan’s chosen candidate for Istanbul mayor lost for a second time, thousands of people  — perhaps an implicit warning of what might happen if future elections are not given due deference.
Drawing on a multiyear data set called V-Dem, the political scientists Anna Lührmann and Staffan I. Lindberg concluded that since 1994, there has been a  of “autocratization,” with 75 countries taking significant steps toward authoritarianism.
But even in countries where that has not happened, corruption by high-level officials, particularly if committed with seeming impunity, can stir unrest.
The recent protests in the Czech Republic came after the police recommended fraud charges against Prime Minister Andrej Babis, who was seen as manipulating the justice ministry to prevent such charges from being filed.
So far, Mr. Babis has  to bow to protesters’ demands, insisting that he will continue working to make the Czech Republic “great again.”
The Danger of Success
Mass protest is a two-edged sword, and a rise in mass mobilizations may bring not an era of resurgent democracy but one of instability.
A more basic phenomenon may be at play in the rise of mass protest movements: Social media, by making it far easier to spread outrage and mobilize people, has made political uprisings subject to the law of large numbers. Simply put, as many more protests are attempted, Dr. Margetts said, the number that succeed will also rise.
But research by Zeynep Tufekci, a social scientist at the University of North Carolina, suggests protests driven by social media are especially fragile. Because they are decentralized, the movements can collapse or be co-opted more easily.
And the gains from even successful protests can be short-lived, particularly if the new government feels pressure to consolidate power quickly.
Protests succeed not just on their own strength but, in large part, by forcing a country’s governing elites to realign their priorities and loyalties — and by giving them an opening to do so. That realignment, however, does not always favor demonstrators.
In Sudan, for example, Mr. al-Bashir was forced out — but the general who consolidated power after him deployed troops against demonstrators. Dozens of people were killed, and . A similar story played out in Zimbabwe, where the 2017 ouster of the longtime dictator Robert Mugabe was followed by a            .
“You can get people out on the street with social media,” Dr. Margetts said. “It’s the next part that’s tricky.”

Banning the import of black clothing to Hong Kong misses the point when it comes to clothing and opposition.
Imagine a world where you couldn’t wear black.
Where would that leave the beatniks and the goths? The Audrey Hepburn wannabes? Where would it leave the fashion folk, and all the social and cultural groups that have seized on the color as an identifier thanks to its long-term associations with … well, take your pick … darkness, existential angst, artistic endeavor, intimidation, obscurity, rigor, efficiency, mystery, depression and sophistication?
Where would it leave the protesters?
This is perhaps a more apropos question. After all, it is the pro-democracy  who have become known most recently for wearing black as they take a stand against the attempts of the Chinese government to make their region less semiautonomous. And it is those protesters who have become the target for a possible ban — at least, that’s the word on the street — on the import of black clothing from mainland China to Hong Kong. This follows            , issued by the Hong Kong chief executive, on the wearing of face masks.
According to the , the no-black-imports edict was first issued in July but recently became more all encompassing.
By banning the import of new garments — including black T-shirts, headbands and goggles — the government (or its minions; it’s hard to tell if the ban is in anticipation of the government’s wishes or reflects its actual wishes) is effectively trying to cut off protesters’ access to their uniform. And those enacting the ban don’t appear to discriminate between the kind of black clothes one might wear to the gym, say, and the kind one might wear on the latest front line.
Which reflects both the intelligence of adopting an easily accessible, everyday color as an idiom of opposition and how hard it will be to combat. 
Though that hasn’t stopped couriers from doing their best to obey. A Hong Kong shipping company called 4PX, for example, told customers last month that it was illegal to ship black T-shirts (also gas masks, laser lights, ski goggles, towels, bandages, loudspeakers and headbands, among other items). When asked where this order originated, a 4PX employee said the list came from China Post, the postal carrier controlled by the Chinese government. China Post did not respond to requests for comment.
Another shipping company that serves Hong Kong, called Phxbuy, posted a similar notice on Sept. 27. A person who answered the phone there blamed customs officials for the decision, without specifying which ones.
Brian Au, the Hong Kong-born, Canada-raised founder of CHSN1 (“chosen one”), a street wear-meets-gym wear line that is manufactured at factories in Guangzhou and offers predominantly black clothing, said his most recent drop had been stuck in customs since September. 
“Basically all courier services have refused to pick up anything black or remotely black,” he said. “I couldn’t even get my samples in. Not a single T-shirt or jacket.”
“I’m empathetic to the situation, but it’s out of our control,” said Mr. Au, who noted that he was not particularly political. “There’s nothing to do at this point except ride it out and be patient.”
To date, the ban does not seem to have had any visible effect on the protesters, who have more than enough black in their closet already, or even on the availability of black clothing, which is still being sold in shops.
But even if black garments did ultimately become a scarce resource, the Chinese government, in focusing on the color, is missing the point.
Yes, black clothing “remains a hugely significant form of oppositional dress,” as Dr. Erin Vearncombe, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto whose research focuses on dress and the body, wrote in an email. It “signals everything from independent thought to outright defiance and revolution.” 
Yes, it has a long and storied history as the color of refusal. Queen Victoria used it to signify her separateness as a widow; the Black Panthers wore black leather jackets, black pants and black shades; the wore             at the Golden Globes; and for “           ” and antifa protests against the far right, it’s become a signature. (It is also seen as a signal of menace. As Dr. Vearncombe noted: “Across historical and geographical contexts, people have considered black clothing as ‘looking’ malevolent, guilty, dishonest, violent.”) 
Yes, “clothing’s uniquely affective, declarative and performative capacity has meant it has long operated as a central communicative site for political activism and demands for social reform,” as two researchers at the University of Brighton. “The use of dress as a form of ‘nonverbal resistance’ seems more prevalent than ever in recent times,” they added.
And yes, black has long been worn as a signal of opposition in Hong Kong, including in the protests against attempts by the Chinese government to introduce a new “moral and national education” plan  and by the pro-democracy marchers of            .
But the fact is, it’s not the color (black or otherwise) that defines protest clothing. It is the fact that a group of people, united in common cause, are united in a common shade. It’s the joint identity that stands out: the visual expression of a voluminous force.
Consider the yellow vests in France. The  at the Women’s March in Washington.             in protests for reproductive rights. The women in white at the State of the Union. And the original women in white, the suffragists. All used a color to render their position and numbers unmistakable, to telegraph a point in a visually impactful way, to render their individual selves a monolith.
So while a black ban, if it takes hold, could ultimately change the makeup of many daily wardrobes, it will simply result in transference when it comes to the uniforms of the opposition.
There are, after all, more than 3,000 shades in the Pantone library. To say the dissidents have options is to understate the matter. Purple for protest!
Can’t you just see it?

The protests in Hong Kong began as a mass expression of frustration over a contentious bill. They have evolved into a violent fight over the future of this Chinese territory. Tunnels, bridges and even the airport have been shut down. Campuses have become battlegrounds. Streets are filled with smoke and tear gas. And thousands have been arrested. To the protesters and their advocates, it all represents a movement to protect the city's freedoms and defend democratic ideals. To the government, the police and their supporters, it is a threat that is damaging the economy and undermining society. Both camps are made up of individuals. Their motivations and perspectives differ. Their means vary. But they all have the same goal: defending their city. These are the faces of the unrest. Tiffany May, Adrienne Carter and Russell Goldman
THE ACTIVISTS 
  In a leaderless movement, they are the closest thing to leaders, a collection of lawmakers, celebrities, activists and others trying to bring global attention to their cause. They have found inspiration in previous pro-democracy demonstrations, including the Umbrella Movement of 2014, for which some were arrested.
  JOSHUA WONG | Social Activist ''Death threats are already part of my daily routine.''
  AGNES CHOW | Social Activist ''Our crime is to participate in protests.''
  JOSEPH ZEN | Catholic Cardinal ''If the government falls into totalitarianism and oppresses people, then we have no choice but to rebel.''
  THE ALLIES Behind the scenes, the protests are supported by a vast network of people, who tend to the injured and counsel the arrested. Some have special skills, playing music in flash-mob orchestras or providing medical attention to the wounded. Others simply cook meals or drive in carpools.
  TUNG AU YEUNG | Volunteer Medic ''We wouldn't chant, we wouldn't touch any weapons, we wouldn't touch tear gas canisters. It would affect the neutral image of first-aiders.''
  NORRIS CHAN | Pro-Bono Lawyer ''I sometimes feel like a den mother. Because once one kid gets to know you, all of their friends would call you.''
  THE ADVERSARIES
  Among those who oppose the protests, there are hardliners eager for Beijing to intervene. There are moderates who want dialogue with the protesters. And there are defenders of the police, who want to see order restored.
  LAU SIU KAI | Adviser to Beijing ''What Hong Kong people are doing now is a betrayal of the motherland.''
  REGINA IP | Pro-Beijing Lawmaker ''Their real objective is to take over Hong Kong.''
  GRACE KWONG | Pro-Police Rally Organizer ''Their professions don't mean they aren't people. They bleed a lot too.''
  RYAN LEE | Volunteer Medic ''I have not slept at home for almost a month.''
  KC LAW | Retiree ''As silver-haired people, we have to do something special. We want to put ourselves between the police and the protesters, to try and protect the kids.''
  KATH LIT | Protest Orchestra Musician ''I sing and play the violin. Other than action, it's easiest to touch people through music.''
  THE CASUALTIES
  The damage is personal and professional. The economy is in recession, hurting businesses, large and small. Protesters and politicians have been attacked or lost their jobs. One woman became a symbol of the protest after she was hit in the eye with a projectile.
  REBECCA SY | Former Flight Attendant ''I lost my job. But now I can say anything I want.''
  JIMMY SHAM | March Organizer ''I admit that I feel fear after my attacks. But I wouldn't choose to lower my head in fear.''
  MOG KOO | Business Owner ''I own seven restaurants, and in the course of five months, I've had to close six of them. But I wouldn't condemn the protesters, this is a social problem.''
  THE SUPPORTERS
  More than a million people took to the streets in the early days of the protests, a sea of parents, students, retirees, professionals -- people rich and poor. Since the police no longer grant permission for large-scale marches, the protests don't attract the same numbers. But public support remains strong.
  RYAN | High School Student ''We can't lose now because the Chinese Communist Party is slowly taking away our freedoms.''
  BILLY WONG | Visually Impaired Divinity Student ''Visual elements in these protests trigger emotions I can't feel. But the scenes are very much alive to me.''
  THE FIGHTERS Dressed in black, they run directly into the fray, wielding umbrellas and Molotov cocktails. They clash with the police at the frontlines of the fight, facing injury, arrest and an uncertain future.
  DONNA | University Student ''I am really worried about the future. If I get arrested, can I face my family?''
  KENNY | High School Student ''Being peaceful didn't allow us to achieve our five demands, so I walked further and further in front.''
  FAT BOY | College Dropout ''Freedom and rights can't be asked for, you have to fight for them.''
  SUZANNE CHOI | University Professor ''Modern mothers will not only take care of the children -- they will also wear sneakers to participate in social movements.''
  CHAN HAK CHI | Retiree ''Many of us swam to Hong Kong in search of freedom.''

  Another shipping company that serves Hong Kong, called Phxbuy, posted a similar notice on Sept. 27. A person who answered the phone there blamed customs officials for the decision, without specifying which ones.
  Brian Au, the Hong Kong-born, Canada-raised founder of CHSN1 (''chosen one''), a street wear-meets-gym wear line that is manufactured at factories in Guangzhou and offers predominantly black clothing, said his most recent drop had been stuck in customs since September. 
  ''Basically all courier services have refused to pick up anything black or remotely black,'' he said. ''I couldn't even get my samples in. Not a single T-shirt or jacket.''
  ''I'm empathetic to the situation, but it's out of our control,'' said Mr. Au, who noted that he was not particularly political. ''There's nothing to do at this point except ride it out and be patient.''
  To date, the ban does not seem to have had any visible effect on the protesters, who have more than enough black in their closet already, or even on the availability of black clothing, which is still being sold in shops.
  But even if black garments did ultimately become a scarce resource, the Chinese government, in focusing on the color, is missing the point.
  Yes, black clothing ''remains a hugely significant form of oppositional dress,'' as Dr. Erin Vearncombe, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto whose research focuses on dress and the body, wrote in an email. It ''signals everything from independent thought to outright defiance and revolution.'' 
  Yes, it has a long and storied history as the color of refusal. Queen Victoria used it to signify her separateness as a widow; the Black Panthers wore black leather jackets, black pants and black shades; the Time's Up protesters wore black red-carpet gowns at the Golden Globes; and for ''black bloc'' and antifa protests against the far right, it's become a signature. (It is also seen as a signal of menace. As Dr. Vearncombe noted: ''Across historical and geographical contexts, people have considered black clothing as 'looking' malevolent, guilty, dishonest, violent.'') 
  Yes, ''clothing's uniquely affective, declarative and performative capacity has meant it has long operated as a central communicative site for political activism and demands for social reform,'' as two researchers at the University of Brighton put it. ''The use of dress as a form of 'nonverbal resistance' seems more prevalent than ever in recent times,'' they added.
  And yes, black has long been worn as a signal of opposition in Hong Kong, including in the protests against attempts by the Chinese government to introduce a new ''moral and national education'' plan in 2012 and by the pro-democracy marchers of 2017.
  But the fact is, it's not the color (black or otherwise) that defines protest clothing. It is the fact that a group of people, united in common cause, are united in a common shade. It's the joint identity that stands out: the visual expression of a voluminous force.
  Consider the yellow vests in France. The pink pussy hats at the Women's March in Washington. The ''Handmaid's Tale'' red robes in protests for reproductive rights. The women in white at the State of the Union. And the original women in white, the suffragists. All used a color to render their position and numbers unmistakable, to telegraph a point in a visually impactful way, to render their individual selves a monolith.
  So while a black ban, if it takes hold, could ultimately change the makeup of many daily wardrobes, it will simply result in transference when it comes to the uniforms of the opposition.
  There are, after all, more than 3,000 shades in the Pantone library. To say the dissidents have options is to understate the matter. Purple for protest!
  Can't you just see it?

The New York Times ,2019-07-02,China Calls Hong Kong Protesters Who Stormed Legislature _Extreme Radicals_,1304 ,"
HONG KONG — The Chinese government and its allies in Hong Kong on Tuesday denounced a group of protesters who had stormed the legislature a day ago, leading a barrage of criticism that gave the city’s embattled leader a moment of reprieve.
Dozens of protesters had  on Monday, breaking glass walls and spray-painting surfaces with slogans on the politically significant anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to China from Britain.
On Tuesday, China’s leadership sent a strongly worded warning to the semiautonomous region, accusing those protesters of being “extreme radicals” who committed an illegal act “that tramples on the rule of law and jeopardizes social order.”
The decision by some protesters to resort to destructive tactics has momentarily deflected scrutiny and criticism away from Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, and her handling of a contentious bill that ignited some of the largest demonstrations the region has seen.
But it also raised questions about the effectiveness and political prospects of Mrs. Lam, who was handpicked by China.
Mrs. Lam, whom protesters have , told her top advisers in a closed-door meeting at her official residence on Tuesday that she intended to serve out her term of office through 2022, said Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker and a member of the Executive Council who was at the meeting.
But her advisers responded bluntly that she needs to work on her handling of Hong Kong’s escalating unrest.
“We all advised her to improve her communication strategy,” Ms. Ip said.
, Mrs. Lam has said several times that she would work harder at reaching out to groups with different political views, but has yet to do so.
For weeks, Mrs. Lam has appeared unable to quell swelling anger as citizens voiced their discontent with the political leadership in Hong Kong, a former British colony that was handed back to China in 1997.
The protests began as opposition to a bill Mrs. Lam was pushing that would allow China to extradite Hong Kong citizens. But they quickly morphed into a broader expression of  and the erosion of the civil liberties that set it apart from the rest of China.
While hundreds of thousands of people marched peacefully to demand Mrs. Lam’s resignation on Monday, a core group of other, mostly younger, demonstrators stormed the legislature. For hours, the police, who had been accused of excessive force in earlier protests, largely stood by, and they made a surprise retreat once the protesters began to breach an inner door.
Some questioned why Mrs. Lam did not urge the police to step in sooner.
“Why did she let the people get into the Legislative Council?” said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political scientist at Hong Kong Baptist University. “In what country is the Parliament not protected by the police?”
Most leading voices in Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing camp, who hold a majority in the legislature, echoed the Chinese government in .
“This is an insult to the Legislative Council, and an insult to Hong Kong’s rule of law,” said Starry Lee, a pro-establishment lawmaker of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, who called on the government to investigate and bring charges in order to send a message that “those who break the law need to be punished.”
Other pro-Beijing lawmakers, business groups and the Law Society, a typically pro-establishment group of lawyers that had earlier called for the government to delay passage of the contentious bill, added their voices to the criticism against the demonstrators.
Opposition lawmakers were more sympathetic to the protesters, saying that they had resorted to violence out of desperation over not being heard.
Surprisingly, a few lawmakers from the pro-Beijing camp said the government ought to accept some blame for the mayhem.
James Tien, the honorary chairman of the pro-establishment Liberal Party, said that by ordering the police to stand back, the government was deliberately “letting the students make a fool of themselves.”
“That seems like they were encouraging these violent acts,” he said.
Some of the city’s pro-Beijing business elite who have come to depend on China for their success also began to ask whether it was time to revive discussions about political reform that would address concerns from protesters about their sense of powerlessness in politics.
“So many people are complaining about the unfairness of the political arrangement right now,” said Felix Chung, a lawmaker who represents the textiles and garment sector. Mr. Chung was referring broadly to a system in which Beijing effectively has the most say over who becomes the territory’s leader and only half the seats in the legislature are filled by popular elections. “I don’t mind political reform,” he said.
Michael Tien, another pro-Beijing lawmaker and retail magnate, went further.
“I am pleading for the chief executive to speak to Beijing to introduce constitutional reform,” he said, referring to a proposal made by Beijing in 2015 to allow residents to elect the chief executive from a slate of candidates approved by a committee under its control.
“To me, this is another case of young people getting frustrated and yearning to have their voices heard,” he said.
It’s unclear if China’s president, Xi Jinping, would even entertain such a proposal. The authoritarian leader has emphasized the importance of maintaining the integrity of China’s territory and sought to expand Beijing’s influence in Hong Kong.
The mainland Chinese news media, which is tightly controlled by the ruling Communist Party, has provided little reporting on the protests that have roiled Hong Kong for the past several weeks and thrown the city’s leadership into a political crisis.
But on Tuesday, Chinese government’s statements criticizing the protests received blanket coverage across major Chinese state media outlets, alongside editorials that blamed hostile Western forces for the unrest. The protesters were portrayed as hooligans motivated by mob violence, with state-run outlets omitting details of their broader political demands.
“Out of blind arrogance and rage, protesters showed a complete disregard for law and order,” said an editorial in the Global Times, a nationalist tabloid.
By limiting discussion of the protests, the government was obscuring a potential embarrassment to the party and Mr. Xi. The government also might be eager to prevent outbursts of nationalism, which can be seen as a challenge to party’s primacy, analysts said.
“The party always wants to stay ahead of Chinese nationalism,” said Dan Lynch, a professor of Asian and international studies at the City University of Hong Kong.
The protests were a test of the Communist Party’s patience with Hong Kong, said Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese politics at King’s College London.
“They think, ‘we’ve allowed these people all these kinds of privileges and freedoms, and look at the way they behave,’” he said. “It will just reinforce the narrative that this is a spoiled kind of place.”
With other pressing matters like a trade dispute with the United States and a slowing economy, however, Professor Brown said that Mr. Xi was likely to take a conservative approach, unless the unrest begins to inflict damage on Hong Kong’s economy.
“Hong Kong lives and dies on its prowess as a financial center,” he said.

The New York Times ,2019-07-25,Hong Kong Police Ban a March to Protest Mob Violence,770 ,"
HONG KONG — The Hong Kong police on Thursday blocked plans for a weekend march in a satellite town where a mob of thuggish men armed with sticks and poles had earlier injured dozens of people in an attack apparently designed to intimidate participants in a weekslong protest movement.
The organizer of the weekend march, which is meant to denounce the anemic police response to that earlier attack, said he would appeal. Some protesters have signaled that they will go ahead with the event whether it is approved or not, a sign that police opposition and increasingly strident denunciations from Chinese officials and local leaders are doing little to curb the demonstrations.
The march was planned for Saturday in the town of Yuen Long, where  attacked people in and around a train station. The attackers, who were dressed in white shirts, were apparently targeting people who were coming home from earlier demonstrations. They            , injuring journalists, a lawmaker and protesters as well as people with no connection to the protests.
The police said that holding a march in Yuen Long, close to villages where some of the attackers fled Sunday night, raised the likelihood of further violence. The police added that they had received 13 letters from Yuen Long district leaders and 1,700 letters from members of the public worried about the safety of the planned march and some urging the police to reject its permit application.
The march organizer, Max Chung, said he would walk the route on his own if his proposal were rejected. Some people posted suggestions for alternative excuses to gather in Yuen Long, including shopping trips and a sarcastic memorial event for Li Peng, the former Chinese premier  and was widely loathed for his role in the 1989 crackdown on the Tiananmen protest movement.
The authorities have been widely criticized for their slow response to the violence in Yuen Long. The police made no arrests on the night of the attacks, even though officers were seen speaking to men carrying sticks and wearing white T-shirts. The police have since arrested 12 men suspected of participating in the attacks, including nine with connections to triads, the organized crime groups who are thought to have carried out the violence.
Police officials said their force had been spread thin by a protest march that took place earlier that day in a different part of Hong Kong. That protest began as a peaceful demonstration against a government proposal, now suspended, to allow extraditions to mainland China and also to call for an independent investigation into accusations of police brutality against protesters.
A smaller group of protesters continued beyond the approved route to the Chinese government’s liaison office in Hong Kong, where they . Police officers and protesters later clashed near the liaison office, with the police firing tear gas and rubber bullets and some demonstrators throwing bricks.
Chinese government officials have sharply criticized the damage to the liaison office. A Ministry of National Defense spokesman said Wednesday that challenging the central government’s authority “absolutely cannot be tolerated” and suggested that  if necessary.
Some analysts have said the police might have been slow to respond to the attack on the train station because they were reluctant to defend protesters after weeks of confrontations on the streets.
A group of more than 200 government officials from 44 departments  on Thursday to Hong Kong’s chief executive,            , criticizing the police and the government’s intransigence toward protesters’ overall demands, including a full withdrawal of the extradition bill.
“When the majority in the society disagrees with the policy made by our government, being civil servants, we should respond to the public’s demands reasonably,” they wrote. “Today we decided to break our silence, to strongly urge the government to respond to those demands.”

The New York Times,2019-11-09,Hong Kong Protester Dies From Fall at Parking Garage,1288 ,"
The death of the student, Chow Tsz-lok, ignited public fury after months of antigovernment demonstrations.
HONG KONG -- A Hong Kong student died on Friday after falling earlier this week from a parking garage where police officers clashed with protesters, a development that further escalated the public's fury after months of antigovernment demonstrations. 
  Chow Tsz-lok, who was a student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, sustained head and pelvis injuries when he fell one story early Monday morning. His death on Friday morning was confirmed by the city's Hospital Authority.
  Anger with the police has run high over the force's widespread use of tear gas, pepper spray and batons on demonstrators during five months of protest. A key demand of the protest movement, which began over a now-withdrawn extradition bill, has been an independent investigation into the police's use of force.
  Thousands of people, including police officers, have been injured since the protests began in June, but despite the rising violence, no one has been killed in the clashes up until now. The police shot and wounded a demonstrator on Oct. 1 and another three days later in what they described as acts of self-defense.
  In addition, several protesters have killed themselves this summer.
  Wei Shyy, the president of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, asked for a moment of silence for Mr. Chow during a graduation ceremony Friday, and was seen wiping away tears before resuming the event.
  The school's student union held a moment of silence and a march on campus. Some demonstrators smashed a window and painted slogans on Mr. Shyy's residence, calling on him to condemn the police.
  Others gathered for an impromptu memorial in the city's Central district, where tempers flared after the arrival of police officers.
  ''Do you know you can't wear masks at a rally?'' a police commander said to a man in black, citing a ban on face masks that was enacted last month under an emergency powers law.
  ''This is a funeral, are you crazy?'' another man was heard yelling back.
  Memorial gatherings were held in the evening across the city, including at the parking garage in the Tseung Kwan O area where Mr. Chow fell. Violent protests later broke out, with protesters throwing bricks and a police officer firing a warning shot into the air in the Yau Ma Tei neighborhood.
  The lawmaker Eddie Chu was arrested late Friday, and at least five other pro-democracy lawmakers were told by the police that they would be arrested in connection with scuffles in the legislature in May.
  Those clashes were driven by anger over the now-withdrawn extradition bill that incited the protest movement, and the detention of the lawmakers added to the grievances of protesters on the streets.
  Mr. Chow, 22, could be the first death as a direct result of the confrontations between the police and protesters. But what exactly led to his fall is still unclear. 
  Some protesters have speculated that tear gas or an effort to flee police officers were factors. But security camera video released Wednesday by the building owner did not show police officers or significant amounts of tear gas in the parking garage before Mr. Chow fell.
  Roger Tam, 21, a fourth-year H.K.U.S.T. science student, said he had been friends with Mr. Chow for the last three years, and they often spent time together playing video games like Grand Theft Auto. Mr. Chow played basketball and netball and was a ''keen protester'' who played close attention to the movement, Mr. Tam said.
  The news of Mr. Chow's death brought a somber mood to the campus. Alvin Lee, 23, a H.K.U.S.T. student who graduated Friday, swapped his graduation gown for black clothes and a mask. 
  ''We can't possibly be in the mood to celebrate when such terrible things have happened to Hong Kong and when our schoolmate just died,'' he said. ''We want our school president to condemn the police and protect us, and we want justice for our dead schoolmate. Where is the truth?''
  Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, said Tuesday that since the case of the student's fall was still under investigation, she would not ''haphazardly jump to conclusions.'' She offered her ''deepest sympathies'' to him.
  She also urged residents to stay away from the protests ''in order to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings when the police are enforcing the law.''
  Suzette Foo, a senior superintendent of the Hong Kong Police Force, said that the case will be handed over to the Coroner's Court. She said the police were ''heartbroken'' at Mr. Chow's death. ''No one wants to see this tragedy happen,'' she added.
  She acknowledged on Friday that officers had been in the parking garage where Mr. Chow was found nearly an hour earlier than previously admitted. But it remained unclear what if any interactions he had with officers.
  Earlier this week Ms. Foo said that police officers had fired 44 rounds of tear gas, 11 rubber bullets, three beanbag rounds and one sponge grenade during operations in the Tseung Kwan O district.
  ''The sole purpose was to disperse those protesters who had assembled, thrown hard objects and attacked the police in that area,'' she said.
  Video from i-Cable News, a Hong Kong broadcaster, showed the police firing rounds of tear gas up into an elevated parking garage from which protesters had thrown traffic cones down.
  Ms. Foo said the point where the student fell was about 130 yards from where police officers fired tear gas that night. She did not deny the possibility that tear gas could have contributed to the incident, but said there was only a small amount in the air when rescuers responded.
  She also denied that the police had interfered with emergency responders who were treating Mr. Chow or had barred an ambulance from reaching him. 
  An emergency responder, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the incident, said officers tried to make rescuers leave as they were treating the injured student. They also blocked an ambulance from approaching, the emergency responder said. Video of the scene showed that another ambulance eventually took Mr. Chow to a hospital.
  Leung Kwok-lai, an assistant chief ambulance officer of the Fire Services Department, said Friday that the ambulance sent to aid Mr. Chow was blocked by buses and private vehicles, but that the ambulance ''did not have any contact with the police on duty.''
  In an email to students, Mr. Shyy, the university president, called for a ''thorough and independent investigation'' into Mr. Chow's death.
  ''We demand clarifications from all parties -- especially from the police, regarding the cause of the delay in those most critical moments that might have saved a young life,'' he wrote. ''We will be outraged if there is no acceptable explanation offered to us.''
  Mr. Chow's fall followed a weekend that was punctuated by violence. Riot police officers charged into multiple shopping malls where protesters had gathered Sunday evening. 
  At one mall in the Quarry Bay area of Hong Kong Island, a man apparently opposed to the protests slashed a man and a woman with a knife and bit off part of the ear of a district council member who attempted to restrain him. Bystanders beat the man before the police arrived.
  Pro-democracy legislators said the district council member, Andrew Chiu, had surgery to reattach his ear on Monday. The man who was accused of attacking him was charged on Monday with assault causing actual body harm, the police said.
  A man who attempted to stab Junius Ho, a pro-Beijing legislator, is being held on a charge of attempted murder, the police said Thursday.

The New York Times,2019-08-13,Hong Kong 's Leader Pleads for Order in a City on Edge,753 ,"
HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's embattled leader on Tuesday pleaded for order after days of escalating chaos, mass protests and violent street clashes that have put the Asian financial hub on edge.
In a news conference with combative reporters -- a day after the city's international airport was effectively shuttered by mass protests -- the city's leader, Carrie Lam, said that without the rule of law it would be impossible for Hong Kong's residents to ''continue to live in a peaceful manner.'' 
  ''The stability and well-being of seven million people are in jeopardy,'' Mrs. Lam said, her voice breaking slightly. ''Take a minute to think about that. Look at our city, our home. Do we really want to push our home to the abyss where it will be smashed into pieces?''
  During street clashes this summer, the Hong Kong police have regularly fired tear gas, rubber bullets and bean bag rounds to disperse protesters on the streets, even in residential areas and crowded shopping districts.
  On Sunday night, the police escalated their tactics against protesters by firing tear gas inside a subway station and chasing protesters down an escalator at another station. The authorities, for their part, accused protesters of attacking officers with gasoline bombs.
  [Here's a guide to what prompted the Hong Kong protests and how they evolved.]
  On Tuesday, Mrs. Lam was frequently interrupted by journalists who demanded an explantation for what protesters have called blatant police misconduct. She looked more visibly emotional than she has at other recent public appearances.
  ''Will you apologize to the girl?'' one reporter asked, referring to a woman who was hit in her right eye on Sunday, apparently by a projectile fired by police officers, during the city's 10th straight weekend of mass demonstrations.
  ''Why have you never condemned the police?'' another asked.
  ''Sir, please do not interrupt,'' one of Mrs. Lam's officials said at one point, as reporters shouted questions while she was trying to speak.
  Toward the end of the briefing, Mrs. Lam said that police operations are not determined by ''someone like myself, who is outside the police,'' and that officers on the ground had to make spot judgments.
  ''It's not my choice to focus on the police, but all the questions have focused on the police,'' she said.
  Separately, protesters were expected to return to the Hong Kong airport on Tuesday afternoon to continue demonstrations that severely disrupted the transportation hub, one of the world's busiest, on Monday. The airport's website showed on Tuesday morning that more than 300 flights had already been canceled that day.
  This summer's protests in Hong Kong began in early June in opposition to legislation that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
  [Read how the protests have put Hong Kong on a collision course with the Communist Party.]
  They have since morphed into a call for free elections, which largely do not exist in China, and spiraled into Hong Kong's worst political crisis since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
  Beijing, which views the unrest as a direct challenge to its authority of the semiautonomous Chinese territory, has warned the protesters to stand down and leaned on Hong Kong's political and business elite to close ranks behind Mrs. Lam, a career civil servant.
  Other issues have often loomed larger than the extradition bill in recent weeks, including the stalled promise of more direct elections, the use of force by the police against demonstrators and a call for Mrs. Lam to resign. But the stalled extradition bill still enrages protesters, and continues to fuel their civil disobedience.
  Mrs. Lam has said the legislation is ''dead,'' but her administration has declined to fully withdraw it.
  Asked by a Reuters reporter on Tuesday if she had the autonomy to withdraw the legislation, Mrs. Lam said: ''This has been answered before on numerous occasions.''
  ''But you've avoided the question on numerous occasions,'' the reporter said. There has been widespread speculation over to what extent China's central government is influencing the Hong Kong government's position on the issue.
  Mrs. Lam has refused to meet with protesters or offer any concessions beyond saying she would shelve the extradition bill.
  Moments before Mrs. Lam spoke on Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on her to meet with protest leaders and ''act on their legitimate grievances.''"
The New York Times ,2019-08-02,Fueling the Hong Kong Protests_ A World of Pop-Culture Memes,1054 ,"
HONG KONG — A Broadway anthem. A Bruce Lee quote. Nods to John Lennon and Quentin Tarantino.
Legions of anti-government protesters have , in the territory’s worst political crisis since Britain returned it to China in 1997. But even as            , protesters are being motivated in the streets (and on social media) by exuberant memes, slogans, songs and artwork.
Like Hong Kong itself, the movement’s aural and visual iconography channels a wide range of Asian and Western influences. Here’s a look at some of the creative expressions and pop-culture inspirations that are propelling demonstrators through a hot, contentious summer.
Nods to Japanese anime
Protesters have released slick videos that promote their cause while paying homage to the Japanese anime film tradition, which often features surreal imagery and biting social commentary.
In one popular video, young demonstrators march in their signature uniform — yellow helmets and face masks — as one carries a yellow umbrella, a symbol of the protest movement since 2014, when demonstrators blocked major streets in Hong Kong to demand more democratic elections.
[Video:  ]
“No matter how difficult the road ahead is, we will keep walking forward together,” a solemn narrator says.
In another video, a narrator reads out the protesters’ five main demands — including Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s resignation and full withdrawal of a bill that would allow extradition to mainland China — over a furious drumbeat, against a backdrop of street clashes.
[Video:  ]
The clip’s cinematography evokes the aesthetic of popular anime, including “Cowboy Bebop,”  in which characters fight for justice in a lawless universe.
[Video:  ]
Hollywood riffs
Hollywood references infuse many of the slogans and memes coursing through the protests.
One popular slogan — “If we burn, you burn with us” — is a defiant line delivered by Jennifer Lawrence’s character in the “Hunger Games” movies, based on the dystopian young-adult novels by .
Another, “Ideas don’t die,” appeared on a poster commemorating a demonstrator who died this summer, alongside an image of the rain jacket the man was wearing when he fell from a building.
That phrase seems to refer to a line in the 2005 film “,” in which a masked avenger battling a totalitarian regime utters the line, “Ideas are bulletproof.”
Another protest poster that has circulated online shows Mrs. Lam’s head superimposed over the body of the actress Uma Thurman, star of .
In this case, the “bill” in question is not a person, but Mrs. Lam’s extradition legislation, which was . Mrs. Lam has suspended the bill and            ,” but she has stopped short of formally withdrawing it, as protesters have demanded.
Echoes of Czech dissent
A recurring visual feature of the protests has been the so-called Lennon Walls, where people have posted hundreds or even thousands of slogans — mostly on Post-it notes — in .
Their name comes from a  where tributes to             appeared after            . It evolved into a place where young Czechs expressed support for democracy and aired grievances against the Communist regime ruling Czechoslovakia.
During the 2014 protests in Hong Kong, demonstrators created their own Lennon Wall, papering a wall near the legislative building with slogans. And this summer, the walls seem to have sprouted everywhere, galaxies of Post-its denouncing the police, calling for more democracy and expressing . Some of the displays have been torn down by people who oppose the protests, but they keep springing back up.
“Come together, leave together,” read one Post-it note in Chinese — evoking a Beatles song, though perhaps not deliberately. “No retraction, no retreat.”
A hometown hero
During street clashes with riot police this summer, some protesters have encouraged each other by shouting the phrase “Be water” (or ).
That’s a reference to a famous line uttered by Bruce Lee, , in a 1971 episode of the American television series “Longstreet.”
In Chinese Taoism, water represents power and flexibility in the face of obstacles. “,” Mr. Lee said. “Be water, my friend.” Many protesters see the line as a symbol of their civil disobedience, permeating Hong Kong society as water flows over a stone.
A Christian hymn
Some of the demonstrators who swarmed the Hong Kong legislative building earlier this summer sang renditions of “,” a 1974 hymn by the American composer Linda Stassen.
The choice partly reflects how Hong Kong’s Christians, about one in nine of the city’s 7.5 million people, .
It’s also a canny strategic choice: Since mass demonstrations in Hong Kong require pre-emptive police approval, some protesters sing hymns because religious assemblies — which are not subject to the same rules — are harder for the police to justify breaking up.
A Broadway anthem
Another popular refrain this summer has been the chorus of “Do You Hear the People Sing?” from the Broadway musical “Les Misérables” (which was adapted from the ).
In the play, and a 2012 film , “Do you hear the people sing?” is an anti-establishment rallying cry for demonstrators in 19th-century France.
But on a recent evening in Hong Kong, Harold Tsai, a protester who was playing the song from a speaker toward a nearby police barricade, said that not all officers seemed to view the song as an antagonistic gesture.
“Some of them sing it,” Mr. Tsai, 28, added. “I see their mouths moving.”

The New York Times ,2019-10-27,Hong Kong Police Brawl With Protesters Outside Luxury Hotel,928 ,"
Demonstrators were expressing support for South Asians in the city, a week after the police sprayed stinging dye at a mosque.
HONG KONG — Police officers in Hong Kong on Sunday fired tear gas and fought with angry demonstrators outside a luxury hotel, another sign of fraying civility in a financial hub roiled by nearly five months of protests.
The protesters began gathering in the afternoon in the same shopping district where a week earlier the police  outside a mosque. The rally on Sunday was billed partly as a show of support for the city’s ethnic minorities. 
Riot police officers fired tear gas on the demonstrators less than an hour after the rally began, and there was a heavy police presence in the area well into the night.
The rally on Sunday was unauthorized and came a day after a local court issued a temporary order that bans the harassment of police officers.
Here’s the latest on the Hong Kong protests.
Rally Descends Into Clashes
The rally on Sunday afternoon unfolded in the harborside neighborhood of Tsim Sha Tsui, a few blocks from the Peninsula, one of the city’s oldest and most expensive luxury hotels. Demonstrators carried signs saying, “Justice will prevail” and “Oppose the Communist Party, fight against totalitarianism.”
There was a heavy police presence from the start, and within minutes, officers were . Reporters inside the Peninsula’s lobby saw people choking on tear gas that had wafted in from the street. The Hong Kong police later said on Twitter that protesters had attacked officers with umbrellas and “hard objects.”
Cindy Chan, a retired janitor, got into a shouting match with three police officers in riot gear on the street outside the Peninsula. She said she had yelled, “Try to use it on yourself and see how it feels!” 
The rally last weekend outside a Tsim Sha Tsui mosque had also been billed as a show of solidarity with the city’s ethnic minorities. It came days after a civil rights organizer was attacked with hammers by men that local news reports had described as South Asian.
When the police dispersed the crowds outside the mosque last weekend, they used water cannons that fired stinging blue dye, hitting protesters, journalists and the building’s entrance. The police later said that the spraying of the mosque had been an accident.
As night fell on Sunday, hundreds of officers marched from Tsim Sha Tsui toward the working-class neighborhoods farther north on the Kowloon Peninsula. A police truck sprayed water cannons, albeit without the stinging blue dye, and more tear gas was fired.
Government Wins Court Fight Against ‘Doxxing’
The rally on Sunday came a day after a Hong Kong court issued a temporary order banning the public from harassing or posting personal details of police officers online. 
The Justice Department had requested the ban as a way of preventing protesters from releasing information about officers and their families — a tactic known as “doxxing.” The police force says it has  of officers or their relatives being harassed after they were doxxed.
The temporary order, in effect until Nov. 8, prompted criticism for its broad language and potential chilling effect on free speech. Legal experts note that it applies only to Hong Kong police officers and not to the broader public.
The doxxing ban is only the latest restriction on the protest movement. In early October, Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, , making it punishable by fines and up to a year in prison.
It was unclear how the government planned to enforce the new doxxing ban.
Doctors and Nurses Criticize the Police 
Hundreds of medical professionals rallied in a central Hong Kong park Saturday night to express opposition to what they described as police violence against protesters. They also condemned recent arrests of medical professionals working on the protests’ front lines.
Police officers in riot gear have suppressed demonstrations for months using tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons and occasionally live rounds. Early this month, an officer shot in the chest, but did not kill,  who had been charging him.
Saturday’s rally ended peacefully, but there were late-night standoffs between protesters and the police in Yuen Long, a district near the border with mainland China. 
Yuen Long has been a flash point in the protests since July 22, when a mob of men in white T-shirts with sticks and metal bars , including journalists and a pro-democracy lawmaker, at the Yuen Long train station.
Protesters Patronize Sympathetic Shops
Protesters have encouraged residents to shop and eat at businesses that support their pro-democracy movement, some of which now display “authentication” stickers. The calls come as a growing number of Hong Kong businesses and storefronts  — mostly by protesters, but also by government supporters.
On Thursday, Lung Mun Cafe, a traditional Hong Kong eatery that supports the protest movement, was vandalized by men wielding steel rods who appeared to be government supporters. Customers turned up to the cafe in droves this weekend, although its windows and cash register were still broken.

The New York Times ,2019-08-08,"Protesters Plan to Swarm Hong Kong _s Airport, a Symbol of Efficiency",1130 ,"
HONG KONG — Antigovernment protesters are expected to kick off a three-day demonstration on Friday at Hong Kong’s international airport, a symbolic attack on both a global transit hub and the city’s closely guarded reputation for order and efficiency.
The protest, which is scheduled to begin early Friday afternoon in the airport’s arrival hall, comes as Hong Kong reels from its worst political crisis since Britain handed the former colony back to China in 1997, and less than a week after protests and a general strike  and led to 148 arrests.
In recent days, mainland Chinese officials have  about the risks of continuing their broad campaign for political reforms. The movement began in opposition to a bill that would have allowed extraditions to the mainland — where the courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party — but has since expanded to include a range of other demands for greater democracy.
The protests this summer began two months ago with a  that drew hundreds of thousands of people in a city of about seven million. Demonstrations have since continued on a smaller scale, though on Monday they reached a new pitch, as protesters followed their call for a general strike by disrupting flights and snarling commutes.
In recent weeks, the protests have often ended with the Hong Kong police firing tear gas and rubber bullets in clashes with protesters. A hard-core contingent of young protesters has increasingly embraced violent street tactics, arguing that the government has ignored more peaceful displays. They  on July 1, the anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to China, and have since attacked several police stations and set fires outside them.
But several protesters, including employees of Hong Kong’s flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific Airways, stressed that the demonstration this weekend was meant to be an entirely nonviolent way of maintaining the movement’s momentum.
“The airport is a symbol of what Hong Kong means on the international stage, and where visitors come into our city,” said Laurie Wen, a writer and documentary filmmaker in Hong Kong. “Our international image is important to us, and we have to keep up the international attention.”
The airport  last year, making it the world’s eighth busiest for passengers, according to Airports Council International. It was also the world’s busiest aviation terminal for cargo.
The government has already suspended the contentious extradition bill that set off the unrest in early June, but protesters are demanding a complete withdrawal of it, along with an independent inquiry into what they call police misconduct and the resignation of the territory’s embattled chief executive, Carrie Lam.
The stakes are high this weekend partly because the protesters have not applied for permission to hold the demonstration, as they have for other protests in recent weeks. That technically makes it an illegal assembly and raises questions about whether it will prompt a physical clash between protesters and the police.
“Once there is confrontation, that changes the calculation,” said Will Horton, the Asia editor at Orient Aviation, a trade magazine that covers the airline industry. “It’s not just passengers that become hesitant to go to the airport, it’s the vast numbers of local employees and foreign crew who will ask their airlines if it is safe for them to fly to Hong Kong.”
Hong Kong’s Airport Authority said on Thursday that it was aware of plans for a “public assembly” the next day. It also said, without elaborating, that it “understands that there is no application so far for these activities” and “has contingency measures to ensure smooth airport operations.”
Later on Thursday, the authority posted a  on its website saying that the airport would operate normally on Friday, although it advised passengers to check their flight status before traveling and to allow “sufficient time” for the journey.
The Hong Kong police said in a separate statement that while they could not comment on operational details, they planned to “monitor the latest developments, then make appropriate arrangement and deployment plans.”
Asked what might happen if protesters tried to enter a secure area of the airport, Mr. Horton said that in similar cases in other cities, the authorities had emptied the secure area and rescreened everyone inside.
On Wednesday, the United States joined several other countries — including , Britain, Ireland, Japan and Singapore — in issuing             to its citizens about traveling to Hong Kong. It advised them to “exercise increased caution” because of recent “confrontational” protests.
The local government said on Thursday that while visitors might have been inconvenienced by the recent protests, Hong Kong remained “a welcoming city for tourists and travelers from around the world.”
Ms. Wen, the writer, said she and her fellow protesters were confident that the police would not dare use tear gas or rubber bullets against them inside the airport, much less “shut the place down entirely.”
“The chances of that are very low, and we plan to be very peaceful,” she said. “So if the government uses force, they will be once again showing the world how oppressive they are and proving our point.”
Protesters held a more limited version of this weekend’s protest at the airport last month, in which hundreds of people chanted and held signs in the arrival hall.
Aviation workers featured prominently in the general strike on Monday. Carol Ng, a union representative for the Hong Kong Cabin Crew Federation, said nearly 4,000 people from the Hong Kong aviation sector called in sick in solidarity, including more than 1,500 Cathay Pacific employees and about 30 of the airport’s roughly 90 air traffic controllers. More than 200 flights were canceled.
In a written statement, Cathay Pacific dodged a question about how many of its employees had participated in the general strike, saying only that its flights that day had been “curtailed because of the air traffic flow control measures.”

The New York Times ,2019-10-14,Homemade Bomb Detonated for First Time in Hong Kong Protests,701 ,"
The explosive device, set off with a mobile phone, indicated an escalation in the street-level arms race between police officers and the protesters.
HONG KONG — A homemade bomb was detonated in Hong Kong on , the police said on Monday, indicating an escalation in the street-level arms race between police officers and the protesters.
The device was hidden in a bush and was triggered by a mobile phone as a police vehicle passed nearby in the Mong Kok district of Kowloon, Suryanto Chin-chiu, a superintendent of the  police’s explosives disposal unit, said at a news conference.
The bomb caused no damage or injuries, but it was the first time such a device had been employed in weeks of clashes, the police said. 
Once armed only with umbrellas to protect against rain and flying tear gas canisters, the demonstrators have more recently brandished bricks and sidewalk paving stones, as well as knives and gasoline bombs. 
The improvised bomb used Sunday, however, was far more complicated in design than a gasoline bomb, and required a higher degree of skill to manufacture. Improvised bombs, often called IEDs, have been used by insurgents in such places as Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria, but how lethal such weapons are depends in good part on the type and quantity of explosives used.
It was unclear what type of explosive charge was in the bomb on Sunday; the answer would determine how serious any escalation of violence could be.
Tang Ping-keung, a deputy police commissioner, said at the same news conference that the force believed the device was intended to injure police officers. 
“These people doing violent acts are not protesters. They are indeed rioters and criminals that are destroying our rule of law,” Mr. Tang said. “Whatever causes they claim they are fighting for can never justify such triad-like behavior,” he added, referring to organized crime groups.
Images of the device showed a red plastic bag, wires, a battery, a Nokia mobile phone and what appears to be a circuit board of the kind typically used by hobbyists. 
As the demonstrations have turned increasingly violent, the Chinese authorities have labeled some of the protesters’ actions “close to terrorism.” Officials in Beijing have warned that the military could intervene in the protests, leaving Hong Kong to wonder what line would have to be crossed to draw such a response. 
In another indication of the rising violence, an officer was  by a demonstrator on Sunday. The police said on Monday that veins in the officer’s neck had been severed, and that he had undergone surgery and was in serious condition. 
The police, too, have stepped up the firepower they have employed since the demonstrations began in June. 
Protesters have deplored the officers’ use of pepper spray and tear gas as excessive since the early days of the protests, but this month an 18-year-old  by a police officer — the first time a demonstrator had been struck with a live round. The teenager survived. 
The police have also deployed trucks that fire a powerful stream of dyed water, capable of pushing back crowds and making demonstrators visible later to officers. 
The police arrested 201 people, between the ages of 14 and 62, over the weekend, they said. The Hospital Authority said that 79 people sought medical attention on Sunday. The police said 12 officers were injured over the weekend, including the officer who was stabbed. 
The protests began 19 weeks ago over a contentious bill that would have allowed for the extradition of people in Hong Kong to mainland China for trial. Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory, has its own judicial system, and residents have additional rights. 
The bill has since been shelved, but the protests have continued. Demonstrators’ demands have increased to include an investigation of the police and universal suffrage.

The New York Times,2019-09-06,"As Demonstrators Push On, No Sign of More Concessions From Government",1236 ,"
HONG KONG -- A day after Hong Kong's leader said she would withdraw the extradition bill that set off months of protests, she gave no sign on Thursday that more concessions would be forthcoming, even as dissatisfied protesters planned to hold more demonstrations.
The city's chief executive, Carrie Lam, said she was optimistic that pulling the bill, along with other measures she offered on Wednesday, would help Hong Kong break its ''impasse.'' At a news conference, she called on peaceful demonstrators not to legitimize ''the really violent protesters,'' in what some saw as an attempt to divide the movement. 
  But there was little evidence that withdrawing the bill, which would have allowed extradition to mainland China, would satisfy even the more moderate demonstrators. Since the protests began in June, the demonstrators' demands have broadened to include political reforms and an independent investigation of the police, whose use of violence in response to the protests has angered many in the city.
  ''I don't accept this,'' said Karen Poon, 31, a social worker who counts herself among the moderate demonstrators. ''Anyone who has committed crimes, neglected their duty and abused their power throughout this incident should be punished by law, in order to uphold real justice.''
  Ms. Poon added: ''What everyone is defending now is not only the anti-extradition cause, but also the universal values of love and justice.''
  Withdrawing the extradition bill had been widely seen as the easiest step the government could take to appease the protesters. The bill -- which many Hong Kongers feared could expose people in the semiautonomous city to mainland China's opaque judicial system -- had already been suspended, but until Wednesday, Mrs. Lam had refused to formally withdraw it.
  She suggested on Wednesday that democratic reforms could eventually be a possibility, under the right circumstances. But she dismissed the protesters' other demands. She did not address them on Thursday, instead promising to establish a ''dialogue platform'' to address the city's troubles.
  Demonstrators said they would carry on with protests that had been scheduled for this week, including plans to disrupt access to the airport on Saturday and to stage various small rallies. Plans for large-scale marches were also being discussed.
  Many hard-line protesters criticized Mrs. Lam's move on Wednesday, saying it was ''too little, too late.'' Not long after her announcement on Wednesday, a group of protesters heckled officers at a police station in the Mong Kok area, aiming laser pointers at them and creating a makeshift barricade to block a road.
  Around the same time, scuffles broke out between police officers and protesters at a subway station in the Po Lam neighborhood, and three people were arrested. A worker at the station was hospitalized, according to the MTR Corporation, which runs the subway system.
  There were positive reactions to Mrs. Lam's Wednesday announcement, including from several business groups. The protests have taken a toll on tourism, retail and small businesses, putting pressure on an economy that was already suffering from the United States-China trade dispute.
  Robert Grieves, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, called the bill's withdrawal ''an important first step to restore business confidence and the city's international reputation.''
  But there were also signs of broad dissatisfaction. Protest slogans echoed in housing complexes and neighborhoods across the city at 10 p.m. on Wednesday, in what has become a nightly ritual.
  A joint statement from 11 Hong Kong student unions called Mrs. Lam's move a ''fatal misassessment of public opinion'' and an ''insult to Hong Kongers who have been fighting for freedom and protecting our basic rights.'' On Thursday, student protesters formed human chains at several high school and university campuses.
  Most demonstrators this summer have been peaceful, but a smaller group of more confrontational protesters have clashed violently with the police. In recent weeks, the police have deployed tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons against protesters, some of whom have thrown gasoline bombs and set fires in the streets.
  Withdrawing the bill was just one of five demands from the protesters, and few expect all four of the others to be met, at least in the near future.
  Democratic reforms would be a long-term possibility at best, and two of the other demands -- amnesty for the more than 1,000 protesters arrested so far, and a retraction of the description of some protesters as ''rioters'' -- are seen by some as potentially compromising the judicial system's independence, although Mrs. Lam has the power to grant pardons and commute sentences.
  But the demand for an independent inquiry into the police's conduct appears to have wide support, including from members of Mrs. Lam's own government. The police's failure in July to stop a mob attack on protesters and bystanders at a train station has been viewed with suspicion, and recent acts of violence caught on video -- including officers' use of pepper spray and batons against people in a subway car last weekend -- have stoked further anger against the force.
  Mrs. Lam implicitly acknowledged that anger on Wednesday when she said she would add two members to an existing police review board and set up a panel of international experts to help with its investigations. But that board does not have subpoena power and is seen as dominated by government supporters, and critics said Mrs. Lam's moves fell far short of the independent inquiry that protesters want.
  ''Setting up an independent inquiry is one of the simplest demands,'' said Bonnie Leung, vice convener of the Civil Human Rights Front, which has organized several large-scale marches in recent months. ''It is the only way that can make them be accountable to the laws and people again so that Hong Kongers can rebuild trust with the police and the government.''
  Analysts have expressed doubt that Mrs. Lam would take such a step, which would almost certainly prompt a backlash from the police. The Chinese government's strong support for the police would also be an obstacle, they said.
  ''It would become a major political issue if Carrie Lam did it,'' said Ma Ngok, an associate professor of government at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ''And I don't think she has that kind of political courage.''
  As of Thursday afternoon, the Chinese government had made no official statement on the bill's withdrawal. Its main representative in Hong Kong, the Central Liaison Office, posted an article from a local newspaper on its website, with the headline, ''Withdrawal is a sign of good will. Violence must be stopped with stronger determination.''
  At her news conference, Mrs. Lam said the decision to withdraw the bill had been hers, pushing back on recent reports suggesting that China's leaders had been the real decision-makers during this summer's crisis. ''They respect my decision and they support it at every stage,'' she said.
  But some were skeptical.
  ''I think she was able to make this concession because she got the green light from Beijing,'' said Samson Yuen, a scholar at Lingnan University who studies social movements in Hong Kong. ''Otherwise, she would have done this long ago.''

The New York Times ,2019-10-13,Police Officer Is Stabbed in Hong Kong During Flash-Mob Protests,1350 ,"
The rallies were spread across much of the city and reflected continuing anger over a ban on wearing face masks at public gatherings.
A police officer was stabbed in  on Sunday, police officials said, in what appeared to be an escalation of the street violence that has gripped the city for months, as flash-mob gatherings unfolded across town. 
The gatherings, in more than half of the semiautonomous Chinese territory’s 18 districts, were the first significant unrest since  was convulsed by violence a week earlier over opposition to             at public gatherings.
The unrest included attacks on the subway system and on businesses that protesters perceive to be supportive of Beijing. The police force said on Sunday that a  had stabbed one of its officers in the neck, and that his condition was stable.
The rowdy gatherings on Sunday — coordinated via social media and encrypted messaging apps — highlighted the continuing opposition to  and capped a momentous week in China’s relationship with the United States.
President Trump said on Friday that the two countries had , offering a temporary détente in a rancorous dispute that has rattled investors, lawmakers and businesses.
Relations between China and the United States were further strained last weekend when a Houston Rockets executive’s  supporting Hong Kong’s protest movement infuriated people on the Chinese mainland. Beijing initially fanned nationalistic outrage, but later moved to             amid concerns that it was damaging the country’s international reputation.
The demonstrations in Hong Kong on Sunday were varied, including smaller gatherings across the city, and also cases of vandalism and arson that targeted government offices, subway stations, and several banks and shops. 
Some protesters blocked roads, broke streetlights, vandalized a train station and spray-painted antigovernment graffiti inside shopping malls.
The Hong Kong police said one of its officers had been slashed in the neck by a protester on Sunday evening with a “sharp-edged” object, and that two people were immediately arrested at the scene. Video of the incident circulating widely on social media appeared to show that the attack was unprovoked. 
The police said the officer was conscious when he arrived at a hospital. 
The South China Morning Post newspaper also reported that a man who protesters suspected being an undercover officer was attacked on Sunday in the Tseung Kwan O district, before other officers dispersed them.
China has increasingly depicted the protest movement in Hong Kong as being separatist in nature even though the demonstrators’ demands do not include a call for independence.
China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, in a meeting with the Nepalese prime minister on Sunday, delivered a stark warning against separatism that was likely targeted at advocates of Tibetan independence but could also be read as a signal to Hong Kong.
“Anyone attempting to split any part of China will only be ruined; any external force supporting the separation of China will only be regarded as a delusion by the Chinese people!” Mr. Xi was quoted as saying in a report by the official Xinhua News Agency.
Sunday’s unrest began suddenly in the afternoon, after a morning of relative calm in the city, and had been promoted on social media under the slogan “blossom everywhere.”
“The more widespread today’s operation is, the more difficult it is for the police to chase us down,” Andy Wong, a 19-year-old university student majoring in Chinese literature, said on the fringes of a flash-mob gathering in the Sha Tin district.
The police fired tear gas and made several arrests, and the city’s beleaguered subway operator closed more than two dozen stations. The entire train network had already been scheduled to close earlier than usual on Sunday night.
Some protesters  said they were demonstrating this weekend to express continued opposition to the face-mask ban, which took effect last weekend and which makes covering one’s face at a public demonstration punishable by up to a year in prison. The city’s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, drew on rare emergency powers to invoke the ban this month, .
Other protesters said that they were disappointed in President Trump for telling reporters at the White House on Friday that Hong Kong’s protest movement had “toned down a lot from the initial days of a number of months ago” and would eventually ”take care of itself.”
“He only thinks about his interests, and he’s only seizing on Hong Kong to bargain with China,” Fanny Fung, a retiree who joined a demonstration in the Wan Chai district of Hong Kong on Saturday, said of Mr. Trump.
The protest movement began in June in opposition to contentious legislation, since shelved, that would have allowed extraditions from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland, where the courts are controlled by the Communist Party. It has since expanded to include a wide range of demands for police accountability and greater democracy.
Many protesters in the movement have consistently appealed to the United States government for support. Notably, thousands  in central Hong Kong last month to drum up support for a bill about the city that is moving through the American Congress.
The draft legislation would penalize officials in mainland China and Hong Kong who suppress freedoms in the city, and require an annual justification for why the United States should offer Hong Kong special trade and business privileges. It is scheduled to be  this week.
One of the bill’s vocal supporters in Congress, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, traveled to Hong Kong this weekend and met with people in the protest movement. Mr. Cruz was scheduled to meet with Mrs. Lam, but he said on Saturday that she had scrapped the meeting after he refused her request to keep their conversation confidential — a claim that her office later denied.
The Hong Kong office of China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday night that Mr. Cruz had “lied through his teeth” and “made indiscreet remarks on Hong Kong affairs.”
Some of Sunday’s gatherings turned into tense standoffs between protesters and police officers. At one of them, a police officer briefly pointed a gun at protesters who were trying to block a main road into Sha Tin.
In a video circulating widely on Sunday afternoon, a masked protester is seen taking a flying leap to kick a riot officer, who was apparently trying to arrest another protester near a shopping center in the working-class Mong Kok neighborhood.
Protesters also vandalized a range of targets across the city on Sunday, including a Bank of China branch, offices of pro-Beijing political parties and at least two Starbucks.
Starbucks became a target for protesters when Annie Wu, the daughter of the founder of Maxim’s Group, a conglomerate that licenses the coffee chain in the city, called protesters “radical” in a September speech at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.
On Sunday, protesters broke into a shuttered Starbucks at a mall in the Tai Koo district and spray-painted “black heart” on its wooden countertop — a play on “beautiful heart,” a direct translation of the Maxim’s name in Chinese. Spokespeople for Starbucks and Maxim’s Group did not immediately return requests for comment.
Ben Chan, 47, who lives near the mall, said the vandalism didn’t bother or surprise him, and that he supported the young protesters behind it.
“Lots of people here support democracy,” he said. “The kids are well educated, and they fight for what they want.”

The New York Times ,2019-10-31,Hong Kong Falls Into Recession; Protesters Defy Mask Ban on Halloween,1145 ,"
The Chinese territory’s economy shrank sharply in recent months, officials said on a day when the traditional wearing of masks became especially provocative.
HONG KONG — Hong Kong’s economy officially fell into recession in the third quarter after enduring nearly five months of protests and a persistent trade war between the United States and China. 
The economy dropped by 3.2 percent in the three months ending in September compared with the quarter that ended in June, Hong Kong officials said on Thursday. It was the worst economic performance for the city since the global financial crisis a decade ago and the strongest signal yet of the damage caused by political unrest.
“The blow to Hong Kong economy is multifaceted,” Paul Chan, the city’s financial secretary, . He said that a full year contraction was also “very likely.”
The performance marked the second consecutive quarter that the territory’s economy shrank, meeting the formal definition of a recession. In the quarter that ended in June, the economy contracted 0.4 percent from the first three months of the year.
Weekends in Hong Kong are now punctuated with public transport shutdowns, road blockages and the early closure of the malls and the luxury stores that were once part of the engine that keeps the city humming.
Tourists that traveled to Hong Kong from mainland China to fill their empty suitcases are almost all gone. During China’s main holiday week in early October, visitors plummeted by  from the year before. 
Hong Kong’s growth has also been buffeted by a protracted trade war between China and the United States and is part of a broader global economic slowdown that has raised fears of recession in other major economies, including Germany and Britain.
In a vague but , the Chinese Communist Party announced Thursday that it would roll out new steps to “safeguard national security” in Hong Kong. Details may emerge in the weeks ahead, but the protests continued on Thursday, with demonstrators using Hong Kong’s Halloween demonstrations to challenge a recent ban on masks at public gatherings. 
Early on Thursday evening, the mood in Lan Kwai Fong, a rowdy night life district known for its booze-soaked Halloween parties, was noticeably muted. While the streets were still filled with revelers in costumes, compared to years past there were fewer Halloween decorations and more security and journalists.
At around 7 p.m., dozens of protesters wearing masks of government leaders like Xi Jinping and Carrie Lam gathered in the district. Amid blaring music from nearby bars, the protesters began shouting slogans like “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.”
Not long after, a tense standoff formed between the police and protesters. Officers soon declared the gathering an unlawful assembly and took the nearly unprecedented step of ordering an immediate evacuation of the district. 
Later in the evening, with the area blocked off, a reveler dressed as Snow White could be seen coughing in the tear gas as tourists took selfies.
The night included multiple clashes between protesters and police elsewhere around the city. The police fired canisters of tear gas at protesters outside the Mong Kok police station in the Prince Edward district, and later in the heart of the central business district, which includes Lan Kwai Fong.
The protest movement began as a fight over a now-withdrawn extradition bill and has expanded its demands to include free elections and an independent investigation into the police’s use of force. But after , the government has since then refused to budge on the other demands, summed up by protesters under the slogan “five demands, not one less.”
Under mounting pressure to take action, Hong Kong’s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, drew on a colonial-era law to ban face masks at public gatherings. The move  since the movement began in June. Pan-democratic lawmakers say the ban is unconstitutional since it was introduced without going through the normal legislative process. On Thursday, the High Court began a two-day hearing to review the lawmakers’ requests to overturn the emergency law.
Dozens of protesters have since been arrested on charges of violating the prohibition. But enforcement has been uneven. Face masks have long been a common accessory in Hong Kong, particularly since a  in the city in 2003, and there has also been confusion about what constitutes a public gathering. The ambiguity has provided cover for some protesters to defy the ban.
Leading up to Halloween night, preparations were being made in anticipation of clashes. In a  on Tuesday, the police warned of possible road closures and urged shops to close early if necessary. In a             released on Thursday afternoon, a police spokesman sought to pre-empt criticism by stating that officers were empowered to use force to remove facial coverings, if necessary.
Ocean Park, the city’s largest theme park,  on Wednesday that it was canceling the last day of its signature seasonal event, Halloween Fest, citing the “current social situation.” The MTR Corporation, the Hong Kong subway operator, also announced that it was shutting train service down early, ostensibly to deter protesters from taking to the streets. 
Prince Edward Station, near one of the busiest shopping districts on the Kowloon Peninsula, was shut down the earliest, at 2 p.m., apparently in response to calls among protesters to gather Thursday at the station, the site of a particularly violent confrontation between police and protesters exactly two months ago. Protesters are still angry about that night after video footage showed riot officers charging into a waiting subway carriage and beating people with batons and dousing them with pepper spray.
The announcement on Thursday about the city’s recession came as no surprise to bar employees in Lan Kwai Fong, which has seen business plummet in recent months.
“The locals are pretty terrified of coming out, the mainlanders used to give us a lot of business but they’re not here anymore, and the tourists aren’t showing up anymore either,” said Paul Pecas, a bartender at a bar in Lan Kwai Fong bar called Tipsy Bird.
Mr. Pecas said that business at the bar had dropped by 50 percent this month compared to last October, which is typically the peak month for customers. Two of Tipsy Bird’s sister bars, he said, had been shut down in recent months because of the protests.
“I have nothing against anyone,” said Mr. Pecas. “I’m just terrified of losing my job.”

The Hong Kong protest movement reached a milestone on Tuesday: It was 80 days since the mass march that started the near-daily demonstrations across the city. That means the protest campaign has lasted longer than the 2014 Umbrella Movement, in which demonstrators occupied roads to call for greater democracy. And even in the face of threatened of intervention by the Chinese military, the protesters show no sign of stopping. Hong Kongers first took to the streets June 9 over a proposed law allowing extraditions to mainland China. Their demands later grew. It is now the biggest political crisis in Hong Kong since Britain returned its onetime colony to Chinese control in 1997. The photographer Lam Yik Fei has spent the past 12 weeks on the sweltering summer streets of Hong Kong, dodging tear gas canisters and pepper spray to document each step of the movement for The New York Times. He was there on June 9, when hundreds of thousands of protesters poured through the skyscrapered canyons of downtown, and again this past Sunday, when a police officer fired a warning shot while under attack from protesters. Here are some of his most powerful images from the past 80 days. -- AUSTIN RAMZY
JUNE Organizers said one million people joined the first march, or nearly one in every seven people in Hong Kong. When the government refused to back down on the extradition bill, protesters came out again on June 12 and surrounded the legislature. The police fired tear gas canisters -- the first of many; by one count more than 1,800 would be fired by early August. Three days later, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, announced that the extradition bill would be suspended, but not withdrawn. That did little to stop the public furor. The next day, protesters marched again. Organizers said nearly two million participated. 
  JULY July 1 marked the 22nd anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China. The date has been one of protest for more than a decade, but this display of dissent culminated in one of the more remarkable moments of the summer: Demonstrators smashed their way into the legislature, painting slogans on walls and defacing symbols of Chinese authority. Two weeks later, the police and protesters clashed in a mall in a satellite town. Then on July 21, hours after protesters vandalized the Chinese government's liaison office in the city, a mob attacked a group of protesters in a train station. The appearance of police inaction on that night has fueled widespread criticism of the Hong Kong force.
  AUGUST Three days of civil disobedience culminated in a call for a general strike on Aug. 5 -- perhaps the biggest day of unrest this summer. Trains were blocked and hundreds of flights were canceled after thousands of civil aviation employees stayed home. At several locations across the city, police officers fired tear gas during protests. A week later, protesters returned to the airport, where days of sit-ins led to the cancellation of hundreds more flights. Protesters assaulted two men from mainland China, and when the violence was broadcast by the local news media, it prompted soul searching and apologies. It was followed by nearly two weeks of relative calm, though protests did continue, including a human chain across much of the city. In Shenzhen, a mainland city near Hong Kong, paramilitary police officers drilled in a show of force. Last weekend, clashes began anew, with two days of tear gas. On Sunday, a police officer fired the first gunshot, a warning after a colleague fell as a group of protesters charged them with sticks and metal bars. Another march is planned for the end of the month. For now, the cycle of protest appears set to continue."
The New York Times,2019-08-26,Hong Kong Officer Fires Warning Shot During Tangle With Protesters,1303 ,"
HONG KONG -- Hong Kong police officers on Sunday drew pistols on protesters who were charging them with sticks, and one fired a warning shot into the air after another officer fell, as a weekend of violent clashes brought an end to nearly two weeks of restraint.
The police on Sunday fired rounds of tear gas and plastic bullets at protesters who threw bricks and firebombs. They also used water cannon trucks for the first time since protests began in June. What were initially demonstrations over an unpopular bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China have since expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the semiautonomous Chinese region. 
  The confrontations in the Tsuen Wan area followed a peaceful march by over 10,000 people. But in a pattern that has been established for months, more aggressive protesters began building barriers on city streets using sidewalk railings and bamboo poles. Soon, large numbers of police officers in riot gear arrived.
  By early evening, the air was swirling with tear gas. The police unleashed water cannons against barriers and in the general direction of protesters.
  ''I don't totally agree with what students do now, such as throwing bricks,'' said Celine Wong, 38, a nurse at a private clinic who joined the march. ''However, what they do is eclipsed by the violence performed by the government now.''
  As the protest appeared to subside at night, a small group of demonstrators smashed up the entryway of a mah-jongg parlor they said had sheltered men who had attacked them weeks earlier. Then a group clashed with the police.
  Jay Lau, 30, said he saw a small group of officers fighting with protesters wielding bamboo sticks and metal rods. The protesters were pushing the officers down Sha Tsui Road when, suddenly, Mr. Lau said, he heard a gunshot. He said he did not see who fired.
  Speaking to reporters early Monday, a police spokeswoman said that six officers raised their revolvers, and that one fired a warning shot into the air after the protesters had put the officers' lives in danger.
  ''The escalating illegal and violent acts of radical protesters are not only outrageous, they also push Hong Kong to the verge of a very dangerous situation,'' the police said in a statement.
  The episode mirrored a similar encounter in 2016, when a police officer drew his gun and fired into the air after a colleague was charged by protesters.
  Earlier Sunday, people who said they were relatives of the Hong Kong police rallied under pouring rain to criticize the government for its inability to find a solution to the crisis that has left front-line officers clashing with protesters for weeks on end.
  The protests began in June over a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Since suspending the legislation that set off the protests, Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, has done little to respond to the protests, leaving the police force as the most public face of the government.
  The protest by police supporters on Sunday was small, with about 200 people attending, and police officials said it did not represent the views of the whole force. But the organizers' concerns that respect for the police force is eroding can be seen in confrontational protests, when officers are often bombarded with abuse from residents and bystanders.
  Ivy Yuen, 40, works for a trading company in Hong Kong and has regularly attended this summer's protests. But she came to the police families' rally on Sunday because, she said, she could sympathize with the difficult position that officers had found themselves in.
  ''There are still some good policemen working for Hong Kong,'' she said. ''Unfortunately, the government chooses not to do anything.''
  ''We are all so helpless in this moment,'' she continued, ''everybody in Hong Kong: those against the protesters, the protesters themselves, the police, everybody.''
  A march on Saturday ended with the police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters who had thrown rocks and at least one gasoline bomb. That clash ended a nearly two-week period of relative calm that saw some standoffs, but not the use of tear gas.
  It also followed two large, peaceful demonstrations that showed the continued strength and unity of the protest movement: a march by hundreds of thousands one week ago and the formation of human chains, illuminated by cellphone lights, across miles of Hong Kong on Friday.
  The police said that in Saturday's protests, they arrested 19 men and 10 women, ages 17 to 52, during dispersal operations in the Kwun Tong, Wong Tai Sin and Sham Shui Po neighborhoods. A friend of Ventus Lau, the organizer of the Kwun Tong march, said he had also been arrested.
  On Sunday, the police arrested 36 people, ages 12 to 48.
  The rally by supporters of the police, organized under the slogan ''We Are Not Enemies,'' criticized the government's use of the police force to manage a political crisis. Its organizers called for an independent committee to investigate the cause of the protests and the official response, and said that misbehavior by some officers was causing the relationship between police officers and the public to ''fall into a tragic abyss.''
  Police commanders distanced the force from the event. Foo Yat-ting, a senior police superintendent, said, ''It does not represent the police force or the four police associations at all.''
  Mrs. Lam said on Saturday that she had met with a group of people, identified in local news reports as former officials and some prominent politicians, to hear ideas for building ''a platform for dialogue.''
  ''I know that in the current predicament, the grievances of the community are deep,'' she wrote on Facebook, adding that some people were ''very unhappy'' with the government's unwillingness to respond to protesters' demands, including a full withdrawal of the extradition bill.
  ''I don't expect conversations to easily untie the knot, stop demonstrations, or provide solutions to problems, but to continue to struggle is not a way forward,'' she added.
  Hong Kong's subway operator said on Sunday that for the second day in a row it was closing stops in an area where a police-authorized protest was planned. Chinese state news media had been highly critical of the subway operator, the MTR Corporation, after special service trains were used to disperse protesters from a station in the satellite town of Yuen Long on Wednesday.
  That special train service helped prevent a clash on Wednesday, but the subway operator was denounced by The People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, as ''working hand in glove with rioters.''
  The MTR Corporation said on Sunday that it was closing three stations served by two lines in the Tsuen Wan area because of the protests, after closing four stations in the Kwun Tong area on Saturday. The closings were criticized not just for preventing participation in authorized protests, but also for inconveniencing other rail users. Graffiti in the Choi Hung station called the MTR ''party rail.''
  Adi Lau, the MTR operations director, said in a message posted Saturday on Facebook that the violence and vandalism in MTR stations in recent months had been ''the biggest challenge that MTR had faced in four decades.''
  He said the decision to close stations was done in conjunction with the police force and other government departments, and was made out of safety considerations, including concerns from employees who felt threatened.
  The MTR also obtained a court injunction on Friday against anyone interfering with train operations, damaging property or causing disturbances. Two weeks ago the airport authority also obtained an interim injunction to restrict access after protests led to canceled flights, chaos and violence in the airport."

Preparing for the worst, protesters have started writing “last letters” to their loved ones.
“When you find this letter, I might have already been arrested or killed.”
This is how a 22-year-old protester in  began what he worries could be the last letter to his family. He used the pseudonym “Nobody”; like most of the young people who have been confronting the police on the front lines, he fears arrest or death.
I met “Nobody” and his cohort during a recent Sunday demonstration. After 19 weeks of street battles with the police, the protesters’ roles are well rehearsed: They move swiftly, each to his or her appointed task, using codes and sign language. They assemble barricades in minutes, only to disperse in seconds.
But I came to observe handiwork of a different kind. As the violence intensified over the summer, I learned that young protesters were writing farewell notes to family and friends in the event that they were arrested or killed. They call them “Wai Shu,” or “last letters.” Some carry handwritten copies to the streets in their backpacks or wallets. Others hide them at home, in drawers and under mattresses. Several people read them to me off their phones.
“Nobody” told me he wrote his letter when he was at a protest last month in Causeway Bay, after witnessing an undercover officer fire into a crowd. “Right in front of me, live bullets,” he said. “At that moment, I learned that my life was at stake.”
The protests have become increasingly violent as they drag on. Protesters are now more aggressive, and the police regularly raid their homes. Arrests have surged. 
On the street, “Nobody” and his teammates blend into the crowds of protesters clad in black, faces covered and armed with gasoline bombs. But their individual missives set them apart, chronicling their lives and loves and what might be lost.
“Dad, I’m unfilial for leaving you so early, before I could fulfill my obligations as a son, to be there for you,” “Nobody’s” teammate Ming wrote. “When I’m gone, please take good care of yourself.”
Another named Tank wrote: “I would be lying if I told you that I’m not afraid. But of course, we cannot give up.”
“Nobody” is a fashion designer. He is lanky, with thick hair that falls over his eyes. He owns a small business that tailors custom clothing and costumes for stage performers. 
He lives with his parents, but he was raised by his grandmother in mainland China. Since he joined the protests, he said, he has been doxxed and has had to change phone numbers several times. He won’t risk crossing through immigration, for fear of being arrested. The reality that he may never see his grandmother again fills him with regret.
“I actually worry that I will die and won’t see you anymore,” he wrote to her in his letter. “I worry that you will cry and feel devastated. But there is no way that I don’t take to the streets.”"
The New York Times ,2019-08-10,"Hong Kong Protesters Defy Beijing Warnings, as Police Fire Tear Gas",1058 ,"
HONG KONG — Defying warnings from China of a crackdown if they continued more than two months of protests, young demonstrators blocked a vital tunnel under Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbor on Saturday, barricaded a traffic intersection and set fires outside a police station in a shopping district popular with tourists.
The Hong Kong police force said in a statement that the fires in the Tsim Sha Tsui district of the city posed “a serious threat to the safety of everyone at the scene.”
Police officers fired tear gas in several locations as a day that began with a show of peaceful defiance outside the headquarters of China’s military garrison descended into an evening of clashes, panic and widespread disruption.
Thousands of activists continued a sit-in at Hong Kong’s international airport, one of the world’s busiest air-travel hubs, on the second day of what they said would be a three-day occupation. The airport demonstration, unlike scattered and often-chaotic protests on the Kowloon Peninsula on Saturday evening, has so far been peaceful.
Stores along Nathan Road, normally crowded with evening shoppers and tourists, closed their doors as the police moved into the area, charging into passers-by caught up in a melee that was shrouded in clouds of tear gas.
Amy Havart, a 32-year-old Hong Kong resident, said she had been leaving a hotel on Nathan Road after drinks with friends when hotel staff members “told us that the police are dropping tear gas outside; we don’t know what is happening at all.”
She said she could not see any protesters or acts of violence so could not understand why there were so many police officers.
“We are all just here trying to have some fun tonight. So why are the police here?” she asked. “I don’t know what is happening to this city. This is just heartbreaking to see.”
[.]
Assailed for days by China’s propaganda machine as violent thugs who must be stopped, Hong Kong’s protest movement — a largely leaderless jumble of groups and causes — started the day with a display of what activists say was their peaceful intent. Several thousand people marched in an orderly procession past China’s military headquarters in the former British colony.
That protest march in Central District, billed by organizers as a “family friendly” event, featured parents, baby strollers and children with balloons, and avoided incendiary slogans about “retaking Hong Kong” that have angered China’s governing Communist Party.
“Xi Jinping should come and take a look at us here, now, and then say whether we are hooligans,” said Ina Wong, a 34-year-old designer, referring to China’s hard-line leader. Ms. Wong took part in the rally along with her husband, a civil servant, and their 2-year-old son.
But the mood turned grimmer as darkness fell and the Kowloon Peninsula, across Victoria Harbor, became the focus for a new round of protests, which, unlike the morning rally in Central, had not been authorized by the police.
The number of protesters was far below the huge demonstrations last month, and Saturday evening’s events in Kowloon were driven largely by groups of a few hundred activists who roamed from area to area in an effort to avoid arrest for participation in an unauthorized gathering. After one group blocked a tunnel under the harbor from Kowloon to Central in the early evening, a different group occupied the entrance to the Lion Rock Tunnel, under a mountain in Kowloon.
The blocking of roads and tunnels recalled some of the disarray that convulsed Hong Kong on Monday, when a  bought much of the city to a standstill, with the police and demonstrators clashing in several areas. Monday’s unrest prompted a barrage of warnings from the Communist Party in Beijing and its allies in Hong Kong that further unrest would not be tolerated.
On Saturday, party-controlled newspapers in Hong Kong published what they said was an open letter signed by more than 700 patriotic residents voicing support for the city’s police, whom protesters have accused of brutality, and demanding that the local government “swiftly stop this chaotic situation.”
The letter, and a series of small counterprotests in support of the government, followed a demand this past week from Beijing’s top official responsible for Hong Kong that China’s supporters there speak out against the protest movement and mobilize to resist any concessions to its demands.
Those demands include the resignation of Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, as well as an independent inquiry into the police’s conduct and the full withdrawal of  that sparked the protests.
China’s characterization of the Hong Kong protests as “turmoil” — the word it used to describe protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989 — has fueled rumors that another crackdown was being planned. But few expect China to send in the People’s Liberation Army, as it did to crush the student-led Tiananmen movement 30 years ago.
Watched by a lone Chinese soldier with an assault rifle guarding the gate to China’s military compound in Central, the morning protesters marched without incident past the garrison, shouting, “Go, Hong Kong! Go, Hong Kong! Fathers and mothers, please preserve our future!”
They ended their parade outside the offices of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council, a body that helped to spur the protest movement by moving in June to adopt legislation that would allow extradition to mainland China. Mrs. Lam, the chief executive, has since suspended the bill, but she has resisted demands that it be formally withdrawn.
Many in Hong Kong are not willing to accept Mrs. Lam’s assurances that the bill is “dead.”
“People don’t trust the government. This is the main problem,” said Ken Lin, an unemployed 39-year-old office worker who helped organize the Saturday march. “The government only obeys Beijing, not what the people of Hong Kong want.”

Hong Kong’s fight, and our own.
HONG KONG — Thirty years ago, I covered a lot of democracy rallies. They were held in the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Central Europe, South Africa and the Middle East. Last week, I covered some more, this time in Hong Kong.
In many ways the Hong Kong rallies felt exactly like the rallies I covered as a cub journalist. There was the same fervent faith in democracy, the same roiling conviction that human beings deserve to live at their full dignity — able to think what they want, read what they want, govern themselves and not simply exist half-strangled and suborned.
There was the same indignant desire not to live in a rigged economy run for the benefit of state-favored oligarchs.
There was the same turning to America that we see at democracy rallies everywhere, the same sense that America is a beacon in the struggle for freedom, the same expectation that of course America is going to step in and help.
There were even the same tactics. Decades ago, the Czechs built “Lennon Walls,” brightly covered walls where people post slogans and encouragement. Today, the Hong Kongers use those, too.
In 1989 democracy protesters across the Baltics formed a vast human chain called “The Baltic Way.” On Friday night, 135,000 Hong Kongers formed “The Hong Kong Way,” a chain that stretched 50 kilometers, or 31 miles, through the city. The protesters held hands, chanted slogans. When the lights were red, they stretched from sidewalks across the streets. When the lights were green, they politely withdrew to let traffic pass.
There was the same resolute pessimism that I remember from those democracy rallies decades ago. On the one hand these people are fervently committed. On the other hand, they don’t exactly see how a ragtag bunch can beat a powerful regime that has tanks. They don’t see the power of the powerless, that sometimes a shift in consciousness is stronger than military might.
I asked several Hong Kong protesters how they thought this thing would end up. They were not optimistic. “We’re seven million,” one man told me. “They’re 1.4 billion.” And yet they were not going to stop protesting and putting their lives at risk.
The big difference between now and then is technology. Today’s protests feel like a frenetic, online media campaign. There is a constant flow of , symbols and videos to keep the clicks coming: anime art, Pepe the Frog, bloody eye patches that refer to a woman who was shot in the eye.
The protesters sample and quote from the great buzz of global culture, which is of course what they are fighting to stay part of. A quote from “Hunger Games” was popular, then some Pink Floyd lyrics. The anthem of this uprising is “Sing Hallelujah to the Lord,” a 1974 Christian song from America.
Technology allows the protesters to suddenly appear and suddenly disappear, ebb and flow — to “be water,” in Bruce Lee’s phrase.
The protesters have online votes about where to take their protest next. They  to download subversive pamphlets into the phones of unsuspecting tourists from mainland China.
There’s an amazing diversity of strategies. The accountants listen to speeches. The Christians sing. The radicals storm the subways.
Of course, the technology helps the Chinese government too. Years ago, we lived under the illusion that the nimble and decentralized swarms of New Power geeks would be more technologically savvy than the clunky, Old Power hierarchies. That’s not true. China’s Communist government seems to be more technologically advanced than the protesters.
There’s a sense the government has the ability to surveil everything. Protesters spend enormous energy trying to go unseen. They don’t use their normal subway cards for fear the state will be able to track their movements. Some protesters have been doxxed, with their private information and photos of their children splashed online. There’s no pro-democracy graffiti in Hong Kong, no posters or T-shirts, no day-to-day sign that anything is happening. When they are not rallying, the protesters evaporate because even the light poles have eyes.
My guess is that if technology helps the protesters become 30 percent more effective, it helps the state become 70 percent more effective.
Many suspect that China will eventually crush these protests. They’ll round up leaders and force businesses to fire participants. Many suspect America will never step in to help. The American right no longer believes in spreading democracy to foreigners. The American left embraces a national narrative that emphasizes slavery and oppression, not that America is a beacon or an example. Neither party any longer sees America as a vanguard nation whose very mission is to advance universal democracy and human dignity.
But there’s something stubborn about the Hong Kongers and deceptively powerful about their cause. Other protesters dreamed of freedom. These people have already lived it. It’s part of their identity. They will prove more ferocious in defense of liberty than the skeptics imagine. Along the way they might rekindle the sense of democratic mission that used to burn so forcefully in American hearts.

The New York Times ,2019-08-11,Hong Kong Convulsed by Protest as Police Fire Tear Gas Into Subway,1221 ,"
HONG KONG — Hong Kong was convulsed by mass demonstrations and chaos for a second straight day on Sunday, as the police fired tear gas into a subway station and the authorities accused protesters of attacking officers with gasoline bombs.
The unrest in several downtown districts came in the 10th weekend of protests in the semiautonomous Chinese territory and capped a week in which the protest movement mounted its fiercest resistance yet to Beijing’s rule of the former British colony.
The chaos and uncertainty, in which the police said some protesters threw gasoline bombs at them, came six days after a general strike and street clashes brought much of the financial hub to a rare standstill.
Those demonstrations prompted Beijing to sternly warn the protesters not to test its resolve and to warn of retribution from the “sword of law.”
[Why are people protesting in Hong Kong? ]
Top Chinese officials have said the demonstrations “have the clear characteristics of a color revolution,” a reference to uprisings in the former Soviet bloc that Beijing believes drew inspiration from the United States, and they  — without evidence — of being a “black hand” bent on stirring chaos in the territory.
For now at least, protesters seem determined to keep pressing their broad demands for greater democracy, in part by using flash-mob-style tactics on the streets that keep the authorities guessing their next move.
The Hong Kong police, meanwhile, appear increasingly eager to clear away the crowds and spray tear gas in residential neighborhoods and popular shopping and night-life districts — even as those tactics outrage residents and help the protesters’ argument that the police force has gone rogue.
The use of gasoline bombs by protesters — which has been fairly rare all summer — in Sunday’s unrest suggested a possible escalation in the movement’s tactics.
The civil disobedience began in the afternoon with a peaceful rally in Victoria Park on Hong Kong Island that had been authorized by the police. The protesters had been expected to march east from the park to nearby North Point, a traditionally pro-Beijing neighborhood and the site of a mob attack on protesters last week.
Instead, the protesters headed in the opposite direction along a major thoroughfare, bringing traffic to a halt and leaving their next moves unclear.
“We no longer demonstrate based on a schedule, which I think works well,” said Dominic Chan, 26, a protester who works in retail. “We spread to different places, because every arrest means one less protester in the field.”
[Here are the creative ways .]
Some protesters tried to approach the headquarters of the Hong Kong police, west of Victoria Park, but retreated as officers charged at them and fired tear gas in Wan Chai, a downtown neighborhood whose bars and restaurants are popular with expatriates. The police said that protesters had also thrown gasoline bombs at officers in the area.
Officers fired tear gas at other protesters in Sham Shui Po and Tsim Sha Tsui, two neighborhoods on the Kowloon peninsula, across a glittering harbor from Hong Kong Island. The police later said that an officer from Tsim Sha Tsui had suffered burns on his legs from a gasoline bomb.
Television footage from Kowloon showed police officers in riot gear charging at protesters and tackling some of them to ground or hitting them with batons. The police said in a statement that some protesters had been hurling bricks at officers, “posing a threat to the safety of everyone at scene.”
A few districts north, television footage showed police officers firing tear gas into the Kwai Fong subway station, near a police station where protesters had gathered. It appeared to be the first time that the police had resorted to that tactic in an effort to clear demonstrators.
Sunday was also the third day of a , one of the world’s busiest, for which protesters did not seek police permission.
There had been  in the city on Saturday, too, as protesters hopscotched around Kowloon and the police fired tear gas in several locations. Smaller groups of demonstrators blocked a vital cross-harbor tunnel, barricaded a traffic intersection and set fires outside a police station in the Tsim Sha Tsui district.
The protests began two months ago in opposition to legislation that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the governing Communist Party. They have since spiraled into  since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997, with protesters demanding the resignation of Hong Kong’s embattled chief executive, Carrie Lam.
One of the movement’s biggest events this summer was last Monday, when a  disrupted businesses and transportation in a city known for its order and efficiency. That evening, men wearing white shirts and wielding sticks briefly attacked a group of black-clad protesters in North Point. Those men were widely believed to be members of local gangs, although no conclusive proof of that has emerged.
The police made 148 arrests during the general strike, though they did not specify how many were linked to the North Point violence. Ng Wun-yim, the chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Fujian Associations, later told reporters that the associations had played no part in the street brawl.
“We don’t want to see violence,” he said on Saturday. “Hong Kong is a civilized society.”
Still, one of his colleagues, Lo Man-tuen, said that local Fujianese would not hesitate to defend themselves if provoked. And ahead of Sunday’s unrest, there were widespread fears that groups of Fujianese gangsters might again assault protesters in North Point.
Last week’s mob attack was reminiscent of another clash on July 21, in which a pro-Beijing mob , a satellite town in northwestern Hong Kong that is not far from the Chinese mainland. North Point residents have been on edge all week, and many stores there were closed on Sunday.
Red banners plastered around North Point on Sunday, apparently by residents, urged Fujianese to “protect” their home.
Scuffles later broke out there between some Fujianese men and journalists who were trying to film them, video footage showed, and young man in a black shirt was assaulted by a group of middle-aged men with sticks. He was later carried into an ambulance on a stretcher with a bloody mouth.
It was not immediately clear why the men had attacked him.

The New York Times ,2019-08-31,Hong Kong Protesters Clash With Police After Defying Ban,1593 ,"
HONG KONG — Crowds of masked prodemocracy demonstrators in Hong Kong defied official warnings, set fires in the streets and battled the police on Saturday in the most intense clashes since protests over the city’s fate began in June.
As government helicopters hovered above, the riot police fired tear gas, pepper spray and water cannons at protesters outside government offices and the Chinese military’s local headquarters. Some in the crowd threw firebombs at police barricades.
The police pumped blue-dyed water into knots of protesters, starkly marking them to make it easier for officers to make arrests. And by nightfall, a makeshift barricade that protesters had erected across a road had been set on fire, sending a plume of black smoke through canyons of skyscrapers and blinking neon signs.
[City on edge: Photographs from Hong Kong’s ]
Tensions had been running high, partly because the protests marked the fifth anniversary of the day the Chinese government  in favor of a more limited voting plan in this semiautonomous former British colony. That decision angered many in Hong Kong, and it set off months of large-scale protests in 2014 known as the Umbrella Movement.
The Hong Kong government said Saturday it would not reopen negotiations on proposals to increase democracy despite demands for a “one person, one vote” system to elect the city’s leader and legislature directly without interference from Beijing.
“Rashly embarking on political reform again will further polarize society, which is an irresponsible act,” the government said. “Any discussions on constitutional development have to be premised on the legal basis, and be conducted under a peaceful atmosphere with mutual trust in a pragmatic manner.”
Top Chinese officials, along with the Hong Kong officials who answer to them, have ruled out concessions to the demonstrators and have pushed a campaign of stepped-up arrests, according to veteran members of the city’s political establishment. Beijing also does not want anything to mar its Oct. 1 celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.
The eruptions of fire and water on Saturday were a further sign of deepening frustration and determination on both sides of Hong Kong’s worst political crisis since the territory returned to Chinese control in 1997.
Jess Chan, 23, a kindergarten teacher who was handing out jackets near the site where protesters were clashing with the police in the pouring rain on Saturday, said there was desperation in the air because of the coming Oct. 1 anniversary and the fact that many protesters were students who would soon return to class.
“This is the last war,” she said.
The authorities, for their part, have signaled that no more defiance will be tolerated. Hong Kong’s government released a statement early Sunday strongly condemning “the radical protesters” who it said had set fires, vandalized property, “hurled numerous petrol bombs” at official buildings and “attacked police officers with corrosive liquid and bricks.”
On Friday, several of the most prominent pro-democracy lawmakers and activists in the city, though many were later released on bail.
Around midday on Saturday, tens of thousands of black-clad protesters began gathering, peacefully at first, in central areas of the city despite the government’s decision to prohibit a demonstration. They marched toward government offices and the home of Carrie Lam, the territory’s besieged chief executive.
“You are in breach of the law,” read a black-and-yellow sign that a police officer held aloft at a playground area early on. “You may be prosecuted.”
[.]
By 3 p.m., throngs of marchers had snarled traffic on several major roads in the pouring rain, as riot police officers blocked streets in the central business district that led uphill toward Mrs. Lam’s residence.
As dusk approached, much of the city’s downtown had been brought to a standstill, either by protesters or the makeshift barricades they had built. And in a harborside park outside government offices and the city’s legislature, protesters began spraying graffiti on the water-filled barriers that the police had erected outside the buildings, and launching firebombs.
The police responded with tear gas and the blue-dyed water, and phalanxes of officers then began clearing crowds across downtown, making arrests and in some cases shooting what appeared to be rubber bullets. The police later said “minimum force” had been used to disperse protesters after “repeated and futile warnings.”
Fire trucks eventually extinguished the giant blaze that had erupted atop the protest barricade. But with tear gas heavy in the air and police sirens wailing, many protesters began moving to other districts on Hong Kong Island and across the city’s harbor to the Kowloon Peninsula. Some of them smashed security cameras, set up new barricades, threw more firebombs and vandalized train stations.
Late Saturday, subway service was suspended across much of Hong Kong after disturbances at several stations. Local news videos showed officers from the police Special Tactical Squad charging a train at the Prince Edward station in Kowloon and using batons to hit several people who were crouching on the floor of a car. After the beating the officers sprayed them with pepper spray and then left.
The police also confirmed on Sunday that two officers had each fired their guns once in the air as a warning on Saturday.
Hong Kong’s political crisis was set off by widespread anger over a bill that would allow criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial. The measure, which critics said could be used to target activists, has been suspended, but not withdrawn as protesters have demanded. Demonstrators’ demands have since expanded to include universal suffrage and an investigation of the police.
[.]
Vincent Ho, who began protesting early on Saturday afternoon with his wife and their 10-year-old son, said that measures like the extradition bill had made him question whether he was comfortable having his son grow up in the city.
“Our freedom is being taken away,” said Mr. Ho, 40, who works at a bank. “Our system is being destroyed, and without that, it’s not Hong Kong anymore.”
In recent days, China’s news media have underlined the Communist Party’s warnings against the protesters by publicizing reports that units of China’s militia, the People’s Armed Police, have been on the move in Shenzhen, the mainland Chinese city next to Hong Kong, and training to suppress protests.
On Saturday, several Chinese news media showed  that they said showed anti-riot police and People’s Armed Police troops on trucks and buses near Shenzhen’s frontier with Hong Kong.
People’s Daily, the main newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, also warned Saturday that Beijing would not stand on the sidelines if the Hong Kong government was overwhelmed by “turmoil.” It likened the protesters to arrogant ants, warning that they stood no chance of prevailing over the central leadership in Beijing.
Street violence has come in fits and starts during this summer’s protests, and life in Hong Kong . But there is growing fear among a wide cross-section of Hong Kong society that the violence, which has included            , could eventually lead to deaths.
Some protesters have in recent weeks thrown bricks, firebombs and other objects at the police, who as of mid-August had , plus rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, to disperse crowds.
Last weekend, the police used water cannon trucks for the first time since the protests , and a few officers drew pistols on protesters, some of whom were charging at them with sticks. And on Friday night, the Hong Kong news media reported, an off-duty police officer was stabbed during an attack by three masked men in a train station. He remained conscious but suffered bone-deep wounds.
Mrs. Lam, the territory’s chief executive, said on Tuesday that the government was looking into “all laws in Hong Kong — if they can provide a legal means to stop violence and chaos.”
Mrs. Lam was answering a question about whether she was considering use of Hong Kong’s sweeping , a colonial-era law that grants Hong Kong’s leader broad powers to “make any regulations whatsoever which he may consider desirable in the public interest.” One fear is that the law could be used to justify blocking some of the messaging apps that are popular with protesters.

HONG KONG — Hong Kong police officers on Sunday drew pistols on protesters who were charging them with sticks, and one fired a warning shot into the air after another officer fell, as a weekend of violent clashes brought an end to nearly two weeks of restraint.
The police on Sunday fired rounds of tear gas and plastic bullets at protesters who threw bricks and firebombs. They also used water cannon trucks for the first time since protests . What were initially demonstrations over an unpopular bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China have since expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the semiautonomous Chinese region.
The confrontations in the Tsuen Wan area followed a peaceful march by over 10,000 people. But in a pattern that has been established for months, more aggressive protesters began building barriers on city streets using sidewalk railings and bamboo poles. Soon, large numbers of police officers in riot gear arrived.
By early evening, the air was swirling with tear gas. The police  against barriers and in the general direction of protesters.
“I don’t totally agree with what students do now, such as throwing bricks,” said Celine Wong, 38, a nurse at a private clinic who joined the march. “However, what they do is eclipsed by the violence performed by the government now.”
As the protest appeared to subside at night, a small group of demonstrators smashed up the entryway of a mah-jongg parlor they said had sheltered men who had attacked them weeks earlier. Then a group clashed with the police.
Jay Lau, 30, said he saw a small group of officers fighting with protesters wielding bamboo sticks and metal rods. The protesters were pushing the officers down Sha Tsui Road when, suddenly, Mr. Lau said, he heard a gunshot. He said he did not see who fired.
Speaking to reporters early Monday, a police spokeswoman said that six officers raised their revolvers, and that one fired a warning shot into the air after the protesters had put the officers’ lives in danger.
“The escalating illegal and violent acts of radical protesters are not only outrageous, they also push Hong Kong to the verge of a very dangerous situation,” the police said in a statement.
The episode mirrored , when a police officer drew his gun and fired into the air after a colleague was charged by protesters.
Earlier Sunday, people who said they were relatives of the Hong Kong police rallied under pouring rain to criticize the government for its inability to find a solution to the crisis that has left front-line officers clashing with protesters for weeks on end.
The protests began in June over a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Since  that set off the protests, Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has done little to respond to the protests, leaving the police force as the most public face of the government.
The protest by police supporters on Sunday was small, with about 200 people attending, and police officials said it did not represent the views of the whole force. But the organizers’ concerns that respect for the police force is eroding can be seen in confrontational protests, when officers are often bombarded with abuse from residents and bystanders.
Ivy Yuen, 40, works for a trading company in Hong Kong and has regularly attended this summer’s protests. But she came to the police families’ rally on Sunday because, she said, she could sympathize with the difficult position that officers had found themselves in.
“There are still some good policemen working for Hong Kong,” she said. “Unfortunately, the government chooses not to do anything.”
“We are all so helpless in this moment,” she continued, “everybody in Hong Kong: those against the protesters, the protesters themselves, the police, everybody.”
A march on Saturday  who had thrown rocks and at least one gasoline bomb. That clash ended a nearly two-week period of relative calm that saw some standoffs, but not the use of tear gas.
It also followed two large, peaceful demonstrations that showed the continued strength and unity of the protest movement: a  and the formation of human chains, illuminated by cellphone lights,            .
The police said that in Saturday’s protests, they arrested 19 men and 10 women, ages 17 to 52, during dispersal operations in the Kwun Tong, Wong Tai Sin and Sham Shui Po neighborhoods. A friend of Ventus Lau, the organizer of the Kwun Tong march, said he had also been arrested.
On Sunday, the police arrested 36 people, ages 12 to 48.
The rally by supporters of the police, organized under the slogan “We Are Not Enemies,” criticized the government’s use of the police force to manage a political crisis. Its organizers  the cause of the protests and the official response, and said that misbehavior by some officers was causing the relationship between police officers and the public to “fall into a tragic abyss.”
Police commanders distanced the force from the event. Foo Yat-ting, a senior police superintendent, said, “It does not represent the police force or the four police associations at all.”
Mrs. Lam said on Saturday that she had met with a group of people, identified in local news reports as former officials and some prominent politicians, to hear ideas for building “a platform for dialogue.”
“I know that in the current predicament, the grievances of the community are deep,” , adding that some people were “very unhappy” with the government’s unwillingness to respond to protesters’ demands, including a full withdrawal of the extradition bill.
“I don’t expect conversations to easily untie the knot, stop demonstrations, or provide solutions to problems, but to continue to struggle is not a way forward,” she added.
Hong Kong’s subway operator said on Sunday that for the second day in a row it was closing stops in an area where a police-authorized protest was planned. Chinese state news media had been highly critical of the subway operator, the MTR Corporation, after special service trains were used to disperse protesters from a station in the satellite town of Yuen Long on Wednesday.
That special train service helped prevent a clash on Wednesday, but the subway operator was denounced by The People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, as “working hand in glove with rioters.”
The MTR Corporation said on Sunday that it was closing three stations served by two lines in the Tsuen Wan area because of the protests, after closing four stations in the Kwun Tong area on Saturday. The closings were criticized not just for preventing participation in authorized protests, but also for inconveniencing other rail users. Graffiti in the Choi Hung station called the MTR “party rail.”
Adi Lau, the MTR operations director, said in  that the violence and vandalism in MTR stations in recent months had been “the biggest challenge that MTR had faced in four decades.”
He said the decision to close stations was done in conjunction with the police force and other government departments, and was made out of safety considerations, including concerns from employees who felt threatened.
The MTR also  against anyone interfering with train operations, damaging property or causing disturbances. Two weeks ago the airport authority also obtained an interim injunction to restrict access after protests            .

A photographer returned to the sites of protests he documented in recent months. His diptychs show how life returns to normal, even if briefly, as the antigovernment movement continues.
On a sweltering afternoon in August, antigovernment protesters in gas masks and hard hats flooded a six-lane road, prompting riot police officers to fire tear gas. But life on that Hong Kong street continued after the clashes faded, even as the neighborhood became the focus of further unrest. 
Such contrasts have been common in Hong Kong since June, when large-scale protests set off  in decades. 
The ongoing demonstrations play out with a familiar cadence nearly every weekend: marches marred by . Then the action is done, replaced by the usual rhythms of the neighborhoods until the chaos comes back.
To show that dissonance,  returned this month to streets where he had documented mass rallies and street clashes in recent months — capturing moments from the exact same vantage points. His diptychs illustrate the jarring contrasts that residents of the Chinese territory now regularly experience.
First major protest
Hundreds of thousands  like Wan Chai to express anger over contentious legislation, since scrapped, that would have allowed extraditions to the Chinese mainland. The demonstration on June 9 was effectively the start of this year’s protest movement, and among the largest demonstrations in the city’s history. Most days the neighborhood is a center of shopping and night life. 
Storming the legislature
When hundreds of thousands marched on the anniversary of Hong Kong’s  on July 1, a smaller group of activists broke into the local legislature, smashing glass walls and spray-painting slogans in its inner chamber.
On Oct. 16, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s embattled chief executive, tried to deliver her annual policy address in the inner chamber. But .
Chaos in a mall
A peaceful rally on July 14 descended into clashes with the police at a shopping mall in northern Hong Kong. There have since been other sit-ins and protests at the same mall, including one in September in which . 
But the mall has mostly stayed open, even as tourism and shopping has fallen amid the protests in Hong Kong that now roil the city most weekends.
 Attack by a mob
A mob of men in white T-shirts with sticks and metal bars on July 22 , including journalists and a pro-democracy lawmaker, at a train station in Yuen Long, a district near Hong Kong’s border with mainland China. The attack raised questions about                                  . 
Yuen Long clashes
Five days after the Yuen Long assaults, tens of thousands of protesters converged on the district. Riot police officers, some of whom are pictured, fired multiple rounds of tear gas to disperse the crowds. As sunset approached months later, a calm pervaded the working-class neighborhood. 
Tension at a bus stop
A police officer on July 30  during a clash in the Kwai Chung district, where residents usually catch the bus. The Hong Kong Police Force later said the weapon had been loaded with beanbag rounds, and that the officer drew it only after protesters attacked him.
The protest movement portrayed the officer, Sgt. Lau Chak-kei, as a villain. On the Chinese mainland, they called him a hero, and the central government  on China’s National Day.
Disrupting the subway
Protesters accuse Hong Kong’s subway operator, the MTR Corporation, of being too close to the local government and police force. Sometimes they express their anger by blocking trains from running, as they did during . Despite the disruptions, the system still carries millions of passengers a day. 
Storming the airport
In an effort to garner global attention, protesters occupied Hong Kong’s international airport on Aug. 12. A largely peaceful sit-in, it devolved into angry clashes . Authorities have since tightened security at the airport’s entrances.
 Tsuen Wan clash
Most weekends, a portion Hong Kong’s roads and highways are transformed into battlegrounds between protesters and the riot police, as was the case on Aug. 21 in this neighborhood, miles from the central business district. Most weekdays, a relative calm pervades the city.
Tear gas in Mong Kok
The Hong Kong police have fired thousands of rounds of tear gas, as they did in the Mong Kok neighborhood. They now regularly warn residents near street clashes to stay indoors and close their windows.

A flurry of arrests

A big rally
Protesters flooded the Central business district, usually full of buses and streetcars, to drum up support for a bill moving through the United States Congress. 
The legislation would, among other things, penalize officials in mainland China and Hong Kong who suppress freedoms in the territory. The United States House of Representatives passed the bill the next day, and the Senate is now considering a similar legislation.

The New York Times,2019-08-31,"In Hong Kong , More Protests Begin After Wave of Arrests",1190 ,"
HONG KONG -- Thousands of pro-democracy protesters began gathering in Hong Kong on Saturday for a 13th straight weekend of demonstrations, over police objections and a day after several high-profile activists and pro-democracy lawmakers were arrested.
Tensions have been running high, partly because Saturday is the fifth anniversary of the day that Beijing announced a plan for limited democracy in the territory. That decision angered many in Hong Kong and triggered months of large-scale protests in 2014. 
  Those protests, known as the Umbrella Movement, now seem almost sedate compared with the demonstrations that have engulfed the semiautonomous city this summer, many of which have led to street clashes and clouds of tear gas.
  Earlier this week, the police declined to issue a permit for a planned mass gathering on Saturday that was meant to mark the anniversary. It was meant to be another of the large, overwhelmingly peaceful marches that have punctuated the summer -- organized by a long-established advocacy group, usually with police permission, and attended by hundreds of thousands of people, including children.
  Two weeks ago, the police banned a march organized by the same group, the Civil Human Rights Front, but hundreds of thousands of people defied them and took to the streets. The group said at the time that the march ''continues the will'' of those who had turned out for a particularly large march in June.
  [Beijing pledged ''one country, two systems'' when it took back Hong Kong. Many fear it is eroding freedoms.]
  But on Friday, after the police banned the Saturday march out of what they described as a concern for public safety, the Civil Human Rights Front said it was canceling it, essentially for the same reason.
  .''
  Many protesters had already said on social media that they planned to march with or without police permission. And by midday on Saturday, protesters of all ages had filled the soccer and basketball courts of a playground in Wan Chai, a neighborhood just a couple of subway stops east of the aborted march's planned starting point.
  ''You are in breach of the law,'' read a black-and-yellow sign that a police officer held aloft at the playground. ''You may be prosecuted.''
  Many of the protesters eventually began marching from the playground toward the home of Carrie Lam, the territory's deeply unpopular chief executive. Their route was expected to pass the headquarters of the Hong Kong police.
  Saturday's unauthorized civil disobedience was unfolding against the backdrop of what appeared to be a coordinated police crackdown on some of the city's highest-profile democracy advocates.
  On Friday, the police arrested at least three prominent activists, including Joshua Wong, a student leader of the Umbrella Movement, and Agnes Chow. The police said the two had been arrested on unauthorized assembly charges related to a June 21 protest in which thousands of people surrounded the police headquarters.
  Three lawmakers from Hong Kong's pro-democracy legislative minority -- Cheng Chung-tai, Au Nok-hin and Jeremy Tam -- were also arrested on Friday, on charges related to their participation in the protests this summer. As of Saturday morning, their Facebook pages suggested that they were still being held.
  Hong Kong's political crisis, the worst since Britain handed the colony back to China in 1997, was set off by widespread anger over a bill that would allow criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial. The measure, which critics said could be used to target activists, was suspended, but not withdrawn as protesters have demanded.
  [How the protests in Hong Kong have evolved, with changing tactics, goals and more violence.]
  Vincent Ho, 40, arrived at the Wan Chai playground on Saturday with his wife and their 10-year-old son. He said he had wondered whether it was safe to bring his son, but that they planned to leave before anything dangerous happened.
  Mr. Ho, who works at a bank, said measures like the extradition bill would make him question whether he was comfortable having his son grow up in the city.
  ''Our freedom is being taken away,'' he said. ''Our system is being destroyed, and without that, it's not Hong Kong anymore.''
  The planned route for the now-canceled Saturday march went from Hong Kong's central business district to the Chinese government's local liaison office, as a means of focusing public attention on the five-year anniversary of Beijing's decision to limit elections.
  On Saturday afternoon, sidewalks outside the liaison office were blocked by water-filled plastic barriers more than six feet high. The city's subway operator, the MTR Corporation, had also closed a nearby train station until further notice -- ''as a prudent measure,'' it said, ahead of ''public activities likely to be taking place.''
  The liaison office was vandalized by a hard-core group of protesters last month, prompting China to denounce them -- and to place a plastic shield around a national crest outside the building, which protesters had spattered with ink. Since then, the police have kept protesters from approaching the building, sometimes by firing rounds of tear gas.
  Street violence has come in fits and starts during this summer's protests, and life in Hong Kong has otherwise proceeded relatively normally. But there is growing fear among a wide cross-section of Hong Kong society that the violence, which has included a mob attack on protesters, could eventually lead to deaths.
  Some protesters have in recent weeks thrown bricks, firebombs and other objects at the police, who as of mid-August had fired more than 1,800 rounds of tear gas, plus rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, to disperse crowds.
  Last weekend, the police used water cannon trucks for the first time since the protests began in June, and a few officers drew pistols on protesters, some of whom were charging at them with sticks. One officer fired a warning shot into the air after one of his colleagues fell to the ground.
  Mrs. Lam, the territory's chief executive, said on Tuesday that the government was looking into ''all laws in Hong Kong -- if they can provide a legal means to stop violence and chaos.'' Mrs. Lam was answering a question about whether she was considering use of Hong Kong's sweeping Emergency Regulations Ordinance, a colonial-era law that grants Hong Kong's leader broad powers to ''make any regulations whatsoever which he may consider desirable in the public interest.''
  On Thursday, the Chinese military sent fresh troops to its Hong Kong garrison. Although the military called it a routine rotation, the move fueled speculation that Beijing might be quietly expanding its presence in the territory.
  Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker in Hong Kong's legislature, said on Friday that she feared the government was setting a trap for the protesters.
  ''The government is anticipating, are they not, inciting chaos and probably mayhem tomorrow,'' she told reporters. ''As a result that would give them the excuse to invoke the so-called Emergency Whatnot Law in Hong Kong. Is that what Carrie Lam is planning?''"

After a week of relative calm and a vote that boosted protesters’ cause, officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets, and demonstrators attacked shops.
HONG KONG — After a relative lull in the protests, thousands of pro-democracy activists turned out Sunday for three demonstrations a week after  that were viewed as a broad endorsement of the movement’s goals.
The vote last Sunday saw pro-democracy candidates win 87 percent of the seats in local district council races. The councils have little political power, but the vote — a rare form of popular elections in the semiautonomous city — was portrayed as  with the government and backing for the protesters’ aims.
The demonstrations on Sunday were all granted “letters of no objection,” unlike the many recent protests that had been banned by the . Activists have denounced such bans as unnecessary restrictions on freedom of assembly. While the first two protests were peaceful, a later one saw several tense confrontations between demonstrators and the police. 
The Hong Kong protests began in June over legislation, since scrapped, that would have allowed . The movement soon  expanded to include a broad range of  and greater democracy.
On Sunday, thousands of protesters, many dressed in black and wearing face masks, descended on the harborfront district of Tsim Sha Tsui, chanting slogans such as “Five demands, not one less!” and “Hong Kongers, take revenge!”
After the Beijing-backed establishment camp was dealt a blow in last Sunday’s elections, Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, finally said the government was considering setting up a committee to look into the crisis. The move stopped short of addressing the protesters’ main demand of setting up an independent commission to examine .
“Never forget why you started,” read a large, black-and-white banner at the march. Not long after it started, the police fired pepper spray and later tear gas at some of the protesters after warning them they had veered from the approved route.
The clashes continued into the evening, with officers firing rubber bullets and more tear gas, while protesters vandalized shops perceived to be friendly to Beijing. 
There was at least one injury on Sunday, when a man who had been clearing roadblocks set up by protesters was struck “in the head by a hard object” wielded by another man, the police said in a statement.
Graphic footage circulating online showed the man being bashed by a long object and collapsing onto a roadblock in Mong Kok as blood trickled down his face, though he appeared to be conscious after being hit. 
The barriers set up by pro-democracy demonstrators to block police movements have become flash points between these protesters and supporters of the government, with scuffles often breaking out when people try to dismantle them.
A Hospital Authority spokeswoman did not provide details of individual cases, but said two men who had been injured in the area were in stable condition. The city has been increasingly on edge in the wake of two deaths over last month: of a 70-year-old man who died after being struck in the head, possibly by a thrown brick; and of a student who died after falling from a building where the police clashed with protesters.
But on Sunday many protesters were committed to showing a peaceful front to the authorities, and hundreds of parents brought their children to the march on Sunday morning against what many consider the indiscriminate use of tear gas by the police.
The marchers waved yellow balloons — the color of the pro-democracy movement — while young children stuck their drawings and handwritten messages for the police outside the government headquarters.
“Please don’t fire tear gas anymore, because besides making other people sick, tear gas will also make you sick and hurt animals,” one primary school student wrote on his note.
Separately, protesters waving American flags marched to the United States Consulate to thank Washington for , which authorizes sanctions on officials responsible for human rights abuses in the city.

The New York Times,2019-10-21,Hong Kong Protesters Continue Marches Despite Police Ban,1255 ,"
The Sunday demonstration, which followed 20 weeks of antigovernment protests, is a test of the movement's strength amid increasing violence
HONG KONG -- Police banned the march. Two of its promoters were attacked.  
  Still, crowds of black-clad protesters filled the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday in a display of continuing support for the monthslong protest movement despite increasing restrictions from the authorities. The march, which passed some of the most prominent centers of Hong Kong's South Asian community, also featured a call for solidarity with the city's ethnic minorities.
  The demonstration began peacefully, eventually punctuated by outbursts of vandalism to shops, bank branches and subway stations. In a reprise of the clashes that have grown common, protesters threw firebombs at the police and officers fired multiple rounds of tear gas at demonstrators. 
  And there were hints of possible escalations in violence. The police used a robot to dispose of a suspected homemade bomb on a street in the Prince Edward neighborhood. It was not immediately clear what danger, if any, the object posed. 
  One week ago, the police said that a homemade bomb was detonated, a first for the protests. The explosive device, which was set off by a mobile phone, did not harm anyone.
  Demonstrators started in Tsim Sha Tsui, a crowded commercial district on the southern tip of the Kowloon Peninsula. They assembled along a promenade beside Victoria Harbor and chanted slogans while the protest anthem ''Glory to Hong Kong'' was played. 
  The Hong Kong subway system, which has sustained widespread vandalism from protesters in recent weeks, closed stations near the march's route. Protesters broke windows in several stations on Sunday and painted graffiti over the protective barriers installed around the entryways. Branches of Chinese-owned banks and outlets of companies seen as hostile to the protest movement were also damaged. 
  The Civil Human Rights Front, the organizer of large, peaceful marches this summer it estimated were attended by up to two million people, applied to host the event Sunday. But the police rejected the application, saying that such demonstrations have often been hijacked by vandalism and violence.
  After the ban, the group backed out of hosting the march, but one of its leaders, Figo Chan, and other pro-democracy figures called on people to turn out anyway.
  ''I'm not afraid of arrest, of jail, of getting beaten up or gashed,'' Mr. Chan said Sunday before the march. ''But I hope people understand that to fight for democracy, freedom and justice, we must sacrifice. We use peaceful, rational and nonviolent means to express our demands. We are not afraid of arrest. What I fear most is everyone giving up on our principles.''
  Another Civil Human Rights Front leader, Jimmy Sham, was attacked by men with hammers on Tuesday in Kowloon. Mr. Sham was released from a hospital, but was continuing to receive treatment and not able to attend the march, the group said.
  That attack led to expressions of support for Hong Kong's ethnic minority communities during the protest Sunday. Some unconfirmed reports said Mr. Sham's attackers were paid South Asian men, and people in the protest movement said they were worried that could lead to retaliatory attacks.
  Some demonstrators on Sunday stood outside the Kowloon Mosque and Islamic Center with signs calling on others to respect the building. ''Be nice to religion,'' one sign read. 
  As the police water canon moved past the mosque, its gate and steps were doused with a stinging blue liquid that officers sprayed at protesters holding signs outside.
  ''What can we say?'' said Yaz Bhutta, a 28-year-old salesman, throwing his hands in exasperation after seeing the stained steps. ''The police are crazy people, spraying chemicals at our mosque. This is where we come and worship every day.''
  Picking up a broom, he brushed streams of the blue liquid into drains.
  The police said the spraying of the mosque entrance had been an accident, and contacted the chief imam and Muslim community leaders to explain and express concern.
  At Chungking Mansions, a building in Tsim Sha Tsui that holds several South Asian-run restaurants and shops, volunteers handed out bottled water to demonstrators.
  Kamil Kaka, who is from southern India and has lived in Hong Kong for more than a decade, said he was a little worried that protesters could target South Asians like him.
  But Mr. Kaka, 32, said he thought Hong Kong people should have a right to protest, as he stood on a side street in Tsim Sha Tsui, watching demonstrators stream down the district's main thoroughfare. 
  ''People are fighting for their freedom,'' Mr. Kaka said. 
  After the attack on Mr. Sham, another protest supporter was seriously injured in an assault on Saturday evening. A 19-year-old man was stabbed in the neck and abdomen near a subway station in northern Hong Kong as he distributed fliers calling on people to join the march. He is hospitalized in serious condition, the government said.
  A 22-year-old man was arrested in the attack. The local news media quoted witnesses who said the attacker had shouted that Hong Kong was a part of China, and that protesters were damaging the city.
  Chinese officials and the state news media have denounced the protests as a separatist movement. Some Hong Kong marchers carried Catalan flags on Sunday to show solidarity with the separatist movement in Spain. Although some protesters have called for Hong Kong's independence from China, it is not a focus of the Hong Kong demonstrators or one of their official demands.
  The protests began over legislation, since withdrawn, that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China from Hong Kong. Hong Kong's top leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, said in September that the government would withdraw the proposal, but public anger with the authorities has remained high.
  The marchers on Sunday reiterated other longstanding demands, including an independent investigation of the police, amnesty for arrested protesters and the introduction of direct elections for the chief executive and the entire legislature. 
  The organizers have also raised two newer demands: a reorganization of the police department and the scrapping of a ban on face masks.
  Mrs. Lam used emergency powers this month to introduce the mask law. The move set off a wave of fresh protests and clashes with the police.
  ''I want to make the best use of every chance to come out,'' said Anne Chin, 32, a clerk who joined the march. ''After the mask ban, we don't know when the government will invoke the Emergency Regulations Ordinance again and implement laws that may further muzzle Hong Kong people's rights.''
  Mr. Chan said at least 350,000 people participated in the protest.
  Protesters said they were determined to show that the movement still had wide support, even if the attendance had been dampened by police bans and recent attacks. Jason Wong, a 26-year-old office worker, brought to the march 60-foot-long black banners signed by residents in each of the city's 18 districts with colorful markers, an effort aided by a team of volunteers. 
  ''The government has posed many restrictions and tried to oppress the Hong Kong people, but we cannot show weakness,'' he said. ''We need to show the world that we have many people calling for common demands, even if not everyone dares to come out.''

Hundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets of Hong Kong last Sunday and marched almost two miles (three kilometers), protesting a proposed extradition bill and calling for the city's leader to step down. It was the largest of three major protests against the bill that were held over eight days. The composite images below help show the enormous scale of Sunday's demonstrations.

HONG KONG — Violence returned to the streets of  on Saturday, as the police fired tear gas and protesters threw stones and gasoline bombs, signaling the end of a period of relative calm in the city.
The clashes in the district of Kwun Tong, in eastern Kowloon, were a marked departure from the peaceful, if sometimes tense, gatherings that had taken place over much of the last two weeks.
Just a day earlier, antigovernment demonstrators had , forming human chains to demand greater democracy in the semiautonomous Chinese territory.
Before officers wielding batons charged at a crowd Saturday afternoon in Kwun Tong, had used bamboo rods and other objects to put up barricades outside a police station. Some protesters had pulled down and dismantled lampposts that they said contained high-tech surveillance equipment.
“We don’t want to be monitored; we want human rights,” said Calvin Wong, a 24-year-old demonstrator. “Maybe people in the mainland accept this, but people in Hong Kong will not.”
In , the police said that protesters had started fires and hurled bricks at officers, and that the use of force had been required to scatter the crowd.
Officers also fired tear gas in the Wong Tai Sin area Saturday evening;  the action was a response to protesters obstructing roads and aiming laser pointers at officers.
The demonstrations in Hong Kong over an unpopular bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. The proposal has since been shelved, but protesters are calling for it to be fully withdrawn. The movement’s demands have expanded to include other issues, such as amnesty for arrested protesters and an investigation into police violence.
Last weekend was the first in many weeks in which the demonstrations did not involve tear gas or clashes between protesters and the police. Organizers estimated that  marched peacefully through the city center under heavy rain last Sunday. The enormous turnout prompted Hong Kong’s top leader, Carrie Lam, to say that she intended to start            .
On Saturday, as demonstrators assembled in Kwun Tong, Mrs. Lam wrote  that the calm had made it an opportune moment for dialogue.
“I don’t expect that dialogue will be able to easily untangle this knot, stop the demonstrations or provide a solution to the problem,” she wrote. “But continuing to fight is not a way out.”
Less than two hours after Mrs. Lam’s post appeared, the police were firing tear gas in Kwun Tong.
In the afternoon, a group of protesters squared off with officers on the wide main road outside the police station. A smaller group of demonstrators retreated into an open-air shopping center after helmeted officers approached from several sides.
There, the protesters hurled debris and other objects, including a bottle that landed among a crowd of police officers and journalists. The bottle burst into flames upon impact, and the officers responded by firing rubber bullets and tear gas in the partly covered area.
Afterward, protesters continued throwing debris and pulled up metal drain covers to create barricades, but they dispersed after the police began moving toward them.
The authorities had granted authorization for a march in Kwun Tong on Saturday, the 12th straight weekend of demonstrations. But at midday, Hong Kong’s subway operator halted train service along a stretch near the protest route, forcing those who wanted to join the rally to walk from more distant stations.
The subway operator said the move had been intended to ensure the safety of passengers and employees, but supporters of the protest movement called it a concession to pressure from Beijing.
Chinese state-run news outlets  this past week for sending trains to take protesters home after a standoff with the police at a subway station late Wednesday.
That night, after  in the satellite town of Yuen Long, a large crowd of demonstrators barricaded themselves inside the station as officers with riot gear approached. The protesters heckled the officers and shined laser pointers at them, and the scene grew tense.
But after an hour or so, station employees began announcing that trains were coming to take demonstrators back to the city. The protesters started moving away from the barricades and boarding the trains. There was no violence.
On Thursday, however, state news media in mainland China  of “working hand in glove with rioters.”
“Once violence is indulged, then public safety is no longer being taken seriously,” read an article in People’s Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper.
The high-tech lampposts that protesters targeted on Saturday had been installed as part of a government program to collect more real-time data throughout the city over the next three years. In a  published this month, the government said that 50 lampposts had been put on the streets so far, including 10 in Kwun Tong’s town center.
Hong Kong officials had said this past week that the lampposts did not have , and that they            .
Francis Fong, a member of a committee advising the Hong Kong government on the project, said that the lampposts automatically pixelated faces and license plates in the still images they took.
Still, Mr. Fong said, “the biggest issue is the lack of trust between the government and Hong Kong people.”

The New York Times ,2019-09-27,"In Hong Kong , Unity Between Peaceful and Radical Protesters. For Now",1606 ,"
Five years ago, protesters were critical of even breaking windows. Now, some are throwing firebombs. 
One slogan in the Hong Kong protests has taken on: “Don’t distance yourself; don’t snitch.”
The slogan is a call for the protesters to remain united, even as different factions emerge and their tactics diverge. 
During the more than 100 days of the anti-government protests, the various camps — from the most peaceful to the most confrontational — have generally avoided publicly criticizing each others’ actions. The approach has persisted despite the steady flare-ups of violence including this past weekend, when protesters threw bricks and gasoline bombs. 
Carrie Lam, the Hong Kong chief executive, complained about the solidarity when she announced this month that , which originally incited the movement.
She called on peaceful protesters to distance themselves from “the really violent protesters who have been attacking our public infrastructure, blocking the roads, storming into buildings and disrupting the normal operations of the airport and the rail,” she said.
While the unity is continuously tested, many protesters consider it important for their success. The Umbrella Movement, the 79 days of sit-ins that began five years ago on Saturday, ended when some groups of protesters denounced others’ more aggressive actions and legal injunctions whittled away the protest sites.
Here is a look at the various camps, their roots, and how they’re coexisting.
The city’s protest tradition
Hong Kong has had a long tradition of peaceful marches attended by hundreds of thousands of people. It dates back at least to 1989, when Hong Kongers turned out en masse to support the Tiananmen protests in Beijing and to . On May 21, 1989,             in the city.
Vigils held on the anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown have continued ever since. , a pro-democracy lawmaker and union leader, who helped organize the events, insisted they be peaceful, rational and nonviolent, or woh-leih-fei in the Cantonese shorthand. 
“This phrase is so popular because Hong Kong people have been quite allergic to any sort of violence or any physical clashes,” said Bonnie Leung of the Civil Human Rights Front, an umbrella group that organized the large, peaceful marches during the current protests. “For a very long time, pan-democratic people and the general public think of woh-leih-fei as the general principle of how we protest in Hong Kong.”
When half a million people marched on July 1, 2003, to protest against proposed national security laws, the government quickly backed down, a big victory for the strategy of woh-leih-fei.
The rise of the militants
But the government has been unmoved by peaceful protests in recent years. And a growing number of activists have criticized the approach as too conciliatory.
“Woh-leih-fei, the gist of it is to give pressure to the government sheerly through the number of protesters,” said Samson Yuen, an assistant professor of political science at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. “But since 2010 the government has been increasingly unresponsive to the turnouts, even if there are high numbers.”
The past decade has seen the rise of a new group of more confrontational protesters known as the yuhng mouh, or “the valiant” in Cantonese. Unlike the peaceful group, they are willing to clash with the police, though they argue the authorities use more force.
Sometimes they damage private property. But they tend to focus their aggression on symbols of the state, such as government buildings, police vehicles and recently the subway system, which has begun to close stations in neighborhoods where protests are taking place.
The targeted nature of such destruction means it generally escapes widespread condemnation from the peaceful camp, but that could change if the damage were to become more haphazard.
“We had to upgrade our protests,” said Peter Mok, a 26-year-old clerk, who was wearing a face mask and a rain jacket as he joined demonstrators repelled from the government headquarters by tear gas on August 31. “Peaceful protests weren’t working. The government said they don’t care.”
‘If we burn, you burn with us”
The ongoing protests have also seen the popularization of a scorched earth philosophy. It is sometimes ” in Cantonese, a combination of words meaning “to embrace” and “to fry.” 
Its adherents argue that Hong Kong has created a deeply unfair system, and needs a complete overhaul. 
“It exists in different degrees because people don’t see themselves as benefiting, not just economically but also having a stake in the system,” said Mr. Yuen.
 A quotation from the “Hunger Games” series of books has been widely used to explain the idea: “If we burn, you burn with us.”
The slogan has been expressly singled out by central government officials, who  to bring down Hong Kong’s economy.
An anonymous Telegram account, “I want laahm chau,” published  challenging the argument that the idea offered an apocalyptic vision for Hong Kong. It argued that the protesters’ creativity showed the city’s prospects if it was not dominated by powerful special interest groups. 
“The end point of laahm chau is not a tragedy, rather it is filled with hope,” it said.
The account helped organize a protest in August that called for the United States Congress to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, legislation that would impose sanctions against officials who undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy. The protesters also called on Britain, the former colonial ruler of Hong Kong, to declare that China had violated the terms of the territory’s handover.
Legacy of the Umbrella Movement
During the final weeks of 2014’s Umbrella Movement, dozens of protesters charged out of their camp near the government’s headquarters,  of the legislature.
The police soon arrived and arrested at least six people. Student groups and pro-democracy lawmakers condemned the destruction.
This year, however, is different. When dozens of protesters grabbed metal bars on July 1 and again began smashing the entry to the legislature, the voices of restraint were quickly drowned out.
The protesters kept smashing, and eventually broke through. Dozens charged inside, damaging symbols of China’s central government, smashing photos of pro-Beijing politicians and marring the walls with graffiti.
“It was you who taught us that peaceful protest don’t work,” read one message.
There was no barrage of criticism from the standard-bearers of nonviolence. And they have largely held back even as violence has escalated and clashes with police officers and civilians have become continued.
“The yuhng mouh and the peaceful, they fought with each other,” Mr. Mok said of the Umbrella Movement. “Each thought they were right. But now we think both sides are important and we have to help each other.”
The symbiotic relationship
Each camps’ importance became apparent early on in the movement. The government pushed ahead with the contentious legislation , which organizers said had drawn more than one million people.
On June 12, . They surrounded the legislature, clashing with the police and blocking pro-establishment lawmakers from entering the building. 
“Without them risking their lives, the bill would have been passed,” said Bonnie Leung of the Civil Human Rights Front. “This was a significant moment, a point for us to understand each other. The radical approach can be useful.”
At the same time, peaceful protests have continued to show the breadth of opposition to the government, she added. On June 16, nearly two million people marched, according to organizers’ estimates. 
“This number is the spine of the whole movement and attracts the attention of the whole world,” she said.
Brian Leung, the only protester to take off his mask and reveal his identity during the July 1 break-in of the legislature, said the escalation that night was the result of sustained support between the two sides.
“The key to that is the mutual trust and the recognition that the other part is also striving for what they’re striving, that there is a common goal,” he said. “Of course it has to be bounded by some kind of moral concern, that your escalation has to be justified.”
Testing the Unity
At times, violent measures have tested the solidarity between protesters. Last month, after days of protest at the airport, . But             helped convince people in the nonviolent camp to remain aligned, said Ms. Leung.
“Because of their willingness to reflect and improve and willingness to apologize, I was convinced that in our movement, the radical protesters and the peaceful protesters, we are still heading in the right direction,” she said. 
That solidarity likely worries the central government more than the actual violence itself, said Mr. Yuen.
“They’re not worried about individuals throwing rocks, because that’s very easy to handle,” he said. “But they are worried when everybody retreats at the same time. Or everybody appears at a place at the same time. If I am the ruler, I would be scared, because I cannot divide the group.”

The New York Times,2019-08-14,Protests Tie Up Airport Again In Hong Kong,1637 ,"
HONG KONG -- Anti-government protesters clashed with Hong Kong riot police on Tuesday, crippling the airport for the second straight day and targeting a potent symbol of the city's position as a global center of commerce and finance that is essential to China.
The mass protests have forced the airport to suspend check-ins, creating long delays for passengers and forcing airlines to cancel hundreds of flights over the past two days. After a chaotic night, check-ins resumed on Wednesday morning, but the airport warned that flights would be rescheduled, and Hong Kong's flagship carrier said there could be ''further flight disruptions at short notice.'' 
  [How the airport that symbolized Hong Kong's global stature became a hub of its unrest.]
  The protests at the airport have been deeply tactical, as the largely leaderless movement strikes at a vital economic artery. Hong Kong International Airport, which opened in 1998, a year after China reclaimed the territory from Britain, serves as a gateway to the rest of Asia. Sleek and well-run, the airport accommodates nearly 75 million passengers a year and handles more than 5.1 million metric tons of cargo.
  The protesters are trying to intensify pressure on the government, which has refused to meet their demands. After earlier efforts to occupy local roads, shopping malls and parks failed to produce concessions, they decided to shift their efforts to a more global stage. At the airport, protesters have handed out pamphlets in different languages explaining their position.
  Peter Tan, a 23-year-old student, said that protesters were sorry to inconvenience travelers, but that other tactics hadn't worked. ''We want to spread the message to them so that they can spread the message to their country,'' he said. ''We are trying to protect our rights and our city.''
  The clashes began late in the evening, after a group of demonstrators attacked a man they accused of being a mainland Chinese police officer impersonating a protester. As medics and the police tried to evacuate him in an ambulance, protesters blocked a road outside the departure hall.
  Some officers in riot gear then began running after demonstrators, wrestling some to the ground. A group of protesters inside surrounded a police officer, taking his baton and beating him with it. They retreated after he  pulled a gun, according to video footage and a police statement.
  The Hong Kong government, in a statement, condemned the protesters' tactics, saying their ''violent acts'' at the airport ''are outrageous and have overstepped the bottom line of a civilized society.'' On Wednesday morning, the city's airport authority said it had obtained a court injunction to prevent unlawful demonstrations there.
  The disruptions are a direct affront to the Chinese leadership. The wave of protests began in June to oppose legislation that would have allowed extraditions to the mainland, where the courts are controlled by the Communist Party. Since then, they have evolved into a broader push to protect Hong Kong's autonomy and civil liberties, including a call for free elections that would be nonstarter for Beijing.
  [Here's a guide to what prompted the Hong Kong protests and how they evolved.]
  In recent days, China has taken an increasingly hard stance, warning protesters in strident terms to stand down or face consequences. Beijing has also ramped up its propaganda machine, portraying the demonstrators as violent gangsters whose activities are starting to look like terrorism.
  President Trump said  in a tweet on Tuesday that he had intelligence ''that the Chinese government is moving troops to the border with Hong Kong.'' But it was unclear what information, if any, Mr. Trump had.
  While Chinese security forces have recently conducted large-scale operations across the border from Hong Kong in Shenzhen, they appear mainly to be a nationalistic show of force. The possibility that China would send its military to restore order still looks remote.
  The city's embattled leader, Carrie Lam, pleaded earlier on Tuesday for order after days of escalating street violence.
  ''The stability and well-being of seven million people are in jeopardy,'' Mrs. Lam said, her voice breaking slightly. ''Take a minute to think about that. Look at our city, our home. Do we really want to push our home to the abyss where it will be smashed into pieces?''
  In the news conference, Mrs. Lam was frequently interrupted by journalists who demanded an explanation for what protesters have called police misconduct. She looked more visibly emotional than she has at other recent public appearances.
  ''Will you apologize to the girl?'' one reporter asked, referring to a woman who was hit in her right eye by a projectile during protests on Sunday. While the police have not confirmed the cause of her injury, the incident, widely reported by local news media, has helped galvanize protests at the airport.
  ''Why have you never condemned the police?'' another journalist asked.
  Toward the end of the briefing, Mrs. Lam said that police operations were not determined by ''someone like myself, who is outside the police.''
  Local authorities have faced criticism from a broad cross-section of Hong Kong society for their use of force in the protests. During street clashes, the police have regularly fired tear gas, rubber bullets and bean bag rounds to disperse protesters, even in residential areas and crowded shopping districts.
  On Sunday night, in addition to using tear gas in a train station, the police beat protesters and chased some down an escalator at another station. The authorities, for their part, accused protesters of attacking officers with bricks and gasoline bombs.
  On Tuesday, the United Nations' human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, said there was evidence that the Hong Kong police had violated international standards for the use of less-lethal weapons like tear gas. In a statement, she condemned violence in any form, urging authorities to act with restraint.
  China's diplomatic mission in Geneva issued a testy rebuttal, expressing ''deep dissatisfaction and firm opposition,'' saying the comments sent the wrong signal to ''violent criminal offenders.'' It said Ms. Bachelet and the United Nations' human rights office should stop interfering in Hong Kong and China's domestic affairs.
  Also on Tuesday, medical professionals held rallies at several local hospitals to protest against the police tactics and in solidarity with the woman who was hit in the eye on Sunday.
  The rallies are a ''direct response to what happened on Sunday,'' Dr. Alfred Wong, a cardiologist who works at Tuen Mun hospital in northwest Hong Kong, said at a gathering there that drew several hundred of his colleagues.
  The disruptions at the airport have left some travelers frustrated and angry.
  Maisa Sodebayashi, who is from Brazil and works in a car factory in Japan, said on Tuesday that while she understood the protesters were fighting for democracy, she also wanted to catch her flight to Rio de Janeiro. She had been stranded in the airport for about 24 hours.
  ''Honestly, I don't know what to do,'' Ms. Sodebayashi said, standing beside a customer service desk.
  On Tuesday afternoon, thousands of demonstrators had occupied parts of the departure and arrival halls, with some using luggage trolleys to block travelers from reaching their gates. The Hong Kong Airport Authority later closed check-in services and advised all passengers to leave as soon as possible.
  By early evening, some arriving flights were still scheduled, along with some departures, apparently for passengers who had managed to clear immigration before check-in closed. But Cathay Pacific Airways, the flagship carrier, told its customers to postpone ''nonessential travel'' out of the city for the rest of the day and on Wednesday.
  The clashes at the airport began late in the evening when police vans arrived outside the departure hall, which was full of black-clad protesters. Some of the protesters obstructed the vans with makeshift blockades and threw plastic bottles at them.
  As midnight neared, bands of protesters were still in the airport, while bewildered travelers, fresh off arriving flights, walked past them and into the sweltering night. The protest crowd later thinned, as did the police presence. By late Wednesday morning, there were just a few dozen protesters in the arrivals hall.
  The police said in a statement issued just before dawn that they had arrested five people on charges of unlawful assembly, breach of peace, assault against police officers and possession of ''offensive weapons.'' Two police officers had been injured, it said.
  Much of the evening chaos at the airport centered on confrontations between protesters and the man accused of being a mainland Chinese police officer. The protesters pushed him to the ground, punching and kicking him, and he eventually fainted, prompting the ambulance evacuation. His identity could not be immediately confirmed.
  Protesters also surrounded another man, bound his hands and feet, searched his belongings and punched him. Some accused him of being a ''fake'' reporter. He, too, was evacuated in an ambulance.
  Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid on the Chinese mainland, wrote in a Twitter post that the man, Fu Guohao, was one of his reporters. ''This shows that they have lost their sense of reason,'' Mr. Hu said of the protesters in a message to a New York Times reporter. ''Hatred has muddled their minds.'' He later said that Mr. Fu had not been seriously hurt.
  In television footage of the incident, Mr. Fu can be heard telling his captors in Mandarin, the primary mainland Chinese dialect, that he supported the Hong Kong police.
  ''You can beat me up now,'' he said."
The New York Times,2019-10-14,"Hong Kong 's Grievances, Transformed Into Images",671 ,"
Instagram-ready works of art and graphic design -- sometimes whimsical, mostly anonymous -- are defining features of the city's antigovernment demonstrations.
HONG KONG -- Soon after a woman in Hong Kong was hit in the eye at a protest, her likeness began circulating as a meme on internet forums where many demonstrators blamed her injury on the police. Within a couple of weeks, protesters had raised over $25,000 online to build a 13-foot statue of her. 
  They called it Lady Liberty Hong Kong, a nod to the Statue of Liberty in New York City.
  Street art and graphic design are defining features of the pro-democracy demonstrations that have roiled the semiautonomous Chinese territory since June. Artists often work quickly and anonymously, and present their oeuvres either in Reddit-like internet forums or public places with heavy foot traffic. 
  Much of the art channels pop-cultural aesthetics taken from Marvel Comics and Japanese anime. And in a financial hub where legions of young people are glued to Instagram, even the street art seems designed to go viral online.
  Some protest artworks depict the movement's heroes -- including Lady Liberty Hong Kong and a demonstrator in a yellow raincoat who fell from a building in June -- in somber, reverential terms. Others are whimsical sendups of Chinese officials, including Carrie Lam, the city's embattled leader.
  These pop art-style posters of Mrs. Lam, below, were designed to be stepped on as pedestrians cross a bridge leading to a train station in the city's Tsing Yi district.
  The poster below, on a wall in the Ma On Shan district in northeastern Hong Kong, seems to liken front line protesters to the protagonists of a battle scene in a Renaissance oil painting. In the foreground, a protester wearing a helmet waves a black flag that shows a dead Bauhinia, Hong Kong's official flower. 
  The posters in the image below are plastered on the ceiling of a pedestrian underpass in the Kwai Fong district in northern Hong Kong. They depict a protester named Chan Yi-chun, who was arrested last month during clashes with the police. 
  The center drawing below shows Mrs. Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, wiping away tears while simultaneously aiming a gun resting on her lap. The poster illustrates a popular, if unproven, sentiment in the antigovernment camp: that while Mrs. Lam has presented herself publicly as empathetic, she has privately encouraged police violence against demonstrators.
  Many protest artworks, like the one below in the Tai Po district, depict subjects in face masks, which demonstrators use to conceal their identities. When Mrs. Lam invoked emergency powers in early October to ban face coverings during protests, she set off further demonstrations.
  The image below shows one of the many so-called Lennon Walls that began springing up across town in June. The walls are named for one in Prague on which young people in the 1980s posted messages airing their grievances against the Communist regime that ruled Czechoslovakia. 
  The drawing in red below, of the woman who was injured in the eye during a protest in August, was on display during a rally later that month at Hong Kong's international airport.
  One of the largest Lennon Walls in Hong Kong sits near a complex of government buildings that includes the city's legislature. A small group of hard-core protesters stormed and vandalized the legislative chamber on July 1, the anniversary of the former British colony's handover to Chinese control in 1997.
  Some critics of the Chinese government have mocked China's leader, Xi Jinping, by saying that he resembles Winnie the Pooh, the cartoon bear. The street collage below was photographed on Oct. 1, hours after Mr. Xi presided over a military parade celebrating the 70th anniversary of Communist rule in China.
  Protesters have also papered some sidewalks with black-and-white pictures of Mr. Xi himself. The idea was for passers-by to step on his face, symbolically erasing his presence.

Nearly four months of pro-democracy protests have rocked Hong Kong, with the police arresting more than 1,500 people and firing at least 2,000 rounds of tear gas. The protests started as peaceful marches, rallies against an unpopular bill. Then came dozens of rounds of tear gas and a government that refused to back down. In the following weeks and months, the city was roiled by protests and violent clashes, as the demonstrations morphed into a broader movement about political reforms and holding the police accountable. These are the critical moments that have defined the Hong Kong protests:

  June 9 First Large March
  Though there had already been two protests against a proposed law that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, the scale of popular discontent became clear on June 9. That day, more than a million -- or nearly one in seven Hong Kong residents -- took to the streets, according to protest organizers.
  June 12 First Use of Tear Gas
  Thousands of people surrounded Hong Kong's Legislative Council. The legislature, where pro-Beijing lawmakers have a majority, was expected to debate the bill. Protesters threw bricks, bottles and umbrellas at police officers, leading to a police response that some demonstrators called excessive. The use of pepper spray, batons and particularly tear gas infuriated many Hong Kong residents. The clashes began a sharp escalation in violence, and the lawmakers postponed debate on the bill.
  June 16 Largest March Ever in Hong Kong
  Angered by the police response, as many as two million people marched in defiance of the government, according to organizers' estimates. In addition to seeing the bill withdrawn, protesters added a new demand: an independent investigation into the use of force by the police.
  July 1 Break-In at the Legislative Council
  Hundreds of thousands of protesters marched peacefully on the anniversary of Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty. But a smaller group of several hundred demonstrators stormed the Legislative Council, smashing windows and vandalizing the building. Some defaced portraits, spray-painted slogans and destroyed surveillance cameras. In graffiti, someone wrote, ''It was the government who taught us that peaceful protest is useless.'' By now, the protesters had more demands, including universal suffrage; amnesty for demonstrators who had been arrested; and retracting officials' characterization of the June 12 protest as a ''riot.'' Driven by anger at the police and at the territory's chief executive, Carrie Lam, who had shelved the bill but refused to withdraw it completely, demonstrators again took to the streets. As clashes between protesters and the police grew more frequent, protests began to spread to neighborhoods far from the government's downtown offices.
  July 14 Clashes in Sha Tin
  After a peaceful march and a tense standoff with the police in the Sha Tin area, riot police officers charged a shopping mall where protesters were gathered, catching casual shoppers and diners in the fray. The images of peaceful shoppers frantically running from the police led to hundreds of people protesting near the mall in the following days.
  July 21 Mob Attack in Yuen Long
  Demonstrators returning from a night of protesting to their homes in the Yuen Long neighborhood were attacked at a train station by dozens of men wearing masks and white shirts. Some of the attackers were later identified as members of organized crime groups. The police were slow to respond to the scene and made no arrests that night, fueling speculation that they were cooperating with criminal gangs.
  Aug. 5 800 Rounds of Tear Gas
  Furious at the police and frustrated by the government's inaction, protesters mounted a new challenge by trying to bring the city to a halt. They staged a general strike, disrupting more than 200 flights, occupying shopping malls and blocking roads and rail lines in seven districts. The police cracked down hard, firing 800 rounds of tear gas and arresting scores of people.
  Aug. 7 Laser Pointer Protest
  The protesters have devised savvy ways to use everyday objects in their clashes with the police: suitcases as shields, traffic cones to contain tear gas canisters and laser pointers to harass officers. On Aug. 6, the police, who said the laser pointers were ''offensive weapons,'' arrested Keith Fong, the president of the Hong Kong Baptist University student union, for possessing several of the devices. He was later released without being charged. The arrest drew hundreds of protesters the next night to a police station in the Sham Shui Po neighborhood to demand his release, and the police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds. The next day protesters put on a laser show during a demonstration near the Hong Kong Space Museum.
  Aug. 11 Woman Shot in the Eye
  A day of protests across the city ended with a woman being struck in the eye by a projectile, believed to have been fired by the police. The police asserted that there was no evidence linking officers to the woman's injury, and later announced that they had launched a formal inquiry. The woman became a symbol of the protests, and many demonstrators wore eye patches in her honor. Also that night, the police fired tear gas toward protesters inside a subway station, violating safety guidelines.
  Aug. 13 Chaos at the Airport
  Protesters raised the stakes again, shutting down air traffic with a dayslong demonstration at Hong Kong's airport, one of the world's busiest. Some protesters tied up and beat two men from mainland China. They suspected one of being a security officer, and the other turned out to be a reporter for a state-run Chinese newspaper. Protesters later apologized. The Chinese authorities denounced the violence as ''close to terrorism.''
  Aug. 18 March in the Rain
  As many as 1.7 million protesters marched peacefully through Hong Kong's city center, according to organizers, in a sign of the movement's sustained strength. It marked a period of quiet, after the havoc at the airport and criticism of the protesters' behavior there. The weekend passed without a single tear gas canister being fired.
  Aug. 31 Escalating Violence
  Chaos returned on the fifth anniversary of China's 2014 proposal to limit direct elections in Hong Kong. Demonstrators set fires to barricades and brawled with the police. Some threw bricks and firebombs at officers. As government helicopters flew overhead, the police fired tear gas and pepper spray at protesters and blasted them with water cannons loaded with blue dye, to mark them for later arrest. Mrs. Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, announced on Sept. 4 that the government would formally withdraw the extradition bill, giving in to one of the protesters' demands. But it was far from clear that it would be enough to quell the movement, or to satisfy Hong Kongers who have called for more ambitious change. The next weekend, the protests continued.
  Sept. 11 'Glory to Hong Kong'
  Written and composed anonymously, then modified in online forums used by protesters, ''Glory to Hong Kong'' was rapidly adopted as an anthem of the pro-democracy movement, replacing the previously popular ''Sing Hallelujah to the Lord'' and ''Do You Hear the People Sing,'' which was heard often during the 2014 Occupy protests. In a slickly produced video for the new song, an orchestra and choir appear in typical protest outfits -- black shirts, helmets, goggles and gas masks.
  Oct. 1 First Police Shooting of a Protester
  The protests in Hong Kong escalated after the police shot a protester for the first time with a live round on the same day that China was celebrating 70 years of Communist Party rule. That day, protesters clashed with riot police officers in at least nine districts, turning Hong Kong into a tear gas-engulfed battlefield."

HONG KONG — Joshua Wong, the student leader of the pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong five years ago that presaged the current protests that have shaken the city, was arrested on Friday morning, his political party said.
Mr. Wong, 22, was arrested on the street at about 7:30 a.m. near a subway station on the south side of Hong Kong Island, his political party, Demosisto, .
Mr. Wong became a widely recognized face of the 2014 Umbrella Movement. As a skinny, bespectacled teenager, he could often be seen on the streets, exhorting huge crowds through a megaphone.
He has been sentenced twice to short prison terms for convictions related to the 2014 protests, and he most recently served two months this year after being convicted on charges .
He was released in June, just as another large-scale protest movement was building over legislation, since suspended, that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial.
Mr. Wong remains a prominent figure in Hong Kong politics, but his profile and influence in the current protest movement is much lower than it was in 2014.
Unlike the Umbrella Movement, the current protest effort has embraced no identifiable leaders, in part because many high-profile figures, like Mr. Wong, had ended up in prison.

The New York Times ,2019-07-05,Protests Over Incinerator Rattle Officials in Chinese City,1571 ,"
WUHAN, China — Days of turbulent street protests against an incinerator project in Wuhan, south-central China’s largest city, have prompted the local government to assure residents it has no plans to build the facility any time soon.
But the authorities have also deployed large numbers of riot police in Wuhan, and are warning of harsh measures if the demonstrations, which have brought thousands of people into the city’s streets, continue.
The dispute here highlights how more countries are having trouble coping with the vast quantities of trash produced by an increasingly affluent global population. Coming up with a solution is particularly tough in a country like China, where years of censorship and propaganda have left many people deeply distrustful of government assurances of the safety of incinerators.
At the same time, many in China resent a common alternative: garbage landfills. That is particularly true in cities like Wuhan that have expanded to envelop landfills previously in fairly rural areas.
Even as they discourage further protests, the local authorities in Wuhan have tried to assure residents that their voices are being heard. Many protests across China have centered on local environmental issues like the incinerator project, and the ruling Communist Party is extremely wary of letting them build into a larger movement.
“The people’s government of the district fully guarantees the participation rights and supervision rights of the masses,” read a statement from the Xinzhou district in eastern Wuhan, the site of the proposed incinerator. But the statement also warned, “Public security organizations will resolutely crack down on illegal criminal acts such as malicious incitement and provocation.”
Local officials acknowledge being caught off guard by the public backlash. Planning for the incinerator started years ago, when the area was mostly rural, and was not updated as a construction boom took place nearby, including at least two schools.
Residents of Wuhan, a city of about 10 million people, say the police have been detaining and taking away some protesters in vans, apparently targeting people who had urged others online to join the demonstrations.
The government forced businesses to close at 6 p.m. across a fairly wide area before a protest on Thursday evening, residents said. That left the police with a free hand to deal with protesters, who could not flee into shops during sometimes violent confrontations.
On Friday evening, a street market several blocks away had been allowed to reopen. But steel shutters were down at storefronts at the hub of protests, a gritty neighborhood of older concrete walk-up buildings.
Hundreds of people milled quietly around on sidewalks on either side of an avenue, sullenly eyeing more than a dozen large black police vans and buses with tinted windows. The show of force and the earlier detentions intimidated possible protesters to avoid further confrontations, residents said.
Many plainclothes officers were evident. Numerous young men in short haircuts stood at each street corner after sunset and watched the crowd while wearing identical outfits: black trousers, black T-shirts and bright red vests incongruously labeled “Civilized Construction Tour Guide.”
There has been no sign that the huge  over the past month inspired the demonstrations in Wuhan, which began on June 28. China’s censors have worked hard to prevent information about the Hong Kong protests from spreading broadly, although word of them has been seeping into the mainland.
And in the lower-income neighborhood in eastern Wuhan where the government wants to build an incinerator at a landfill, the Hong Kong protests seem to have little or no appeal. Residents seem aware of the danger of being seen by the authorities as having drawn any inspiration at all from Hong Kong.
“We have nothing to do with Hong Kong whatsoever,” said a posting on one of the online chat groups that have been used to coordinate protests.
Experts have been skeptical that the demonstrations in Hong Kong, over a local bill that would allow extradition to the mainland, would encourage protests in China even if they were widely reported. There is , which many mainland Chinese regard as a prosperous place that already receives favorable treatment from Beijing.
Even before the Wuhan protests began, residents had been complaining online about the smell from a large landfill at the site of the proposed incinerator. The local government tried to reassure them by announcing that it was putting thicker plastic film over the waste and installing an air purification system.
Street protests were set off by noisy construction work near the landfill that apparently led some residents to believe that work on the incinerator had begun. But the Xinzhou district government said the noise was from the demolition of a nearby rail line.
It said that while planning had been underway for an incinerator in the area, it would not proceed until environmental impact assessments had been carried out, and that the public’s views on the project would be taken into account. That did not mollify protesters, who feared that the consultation process would still end in construction of the incinerator.
Periodic protests against incinerators have been  in China. But the ones in Wuhan appear to have been larger than most, although a protest against an incinerator in Hangzhou in 2014            , with at least 10 demonstrators and 29 police officers injured.
Older incinerators in China have been a source of emissions that can damage the body’s nervous system. Such pollutants, particularly long-lasting substances like dioxin and mercury, are not only dangerous in China but can also float on air currents across the Pacific, reaching as far as the United States, according to atmospheric research based on satellite observations.
Better incinerator technology that eliminates almost all emissions, already used widely in Europe, is now available in China, but it is many times more expensive to install. Chinese officials have tried hard to persuade the public that new incinerators are being built with such improved technology.
The new incinerators also use the heat from burning garbage to generate electricity. That helps reduce slightly the need to burn coal, which is still China’s dominant fuel source, although renewable energy is expanding quickly.
In a country with pervasive censorship and intensive propaganda, many people deeply distrust the government’s safety assurances on environmental issues.
China faces a very real problem in disposing of the garbage generated by a population of 1.4 billion whose standard of living has soared over the past four decades. Almost all of the population is crowded into the eastern two-thirds of the country, and little space is available there for landfills.
Trucking garbage to rural areas in western China is prohibitively expensive, and neighbors like the Philippines are .
China is trying to step up recycling. Shanghai began requiring households and offices on Monday to start sorting their trash.
China’s leaders keep a very close eye on local protests over environmental concerns, mainly to make sure that they show no sign of being coordinated between cities. They are leery of any broader movement that could challenge the Communist Party’s authority.
For China’s leaders, self-governing Taiwan, which they regard as a part of Chinese territory, offers a cautionary tale about the political dangers that can arise from environmental protests in a single city.
Successful protests in 1986 to block the opening of a DuPont chemical factory in Lukang, Taiwan, galvanized broader opposition on the island to single-party rule by the Nationalist Party. The demonstrations contributed to the end of martial law the following year and Taiwan’s subsequent evolution into a thriving, multiparty democracy.
The Chinese authorities’ willingness to give in, at times, when strenuously opposed on a local environmental issue was dramatically illustrated in 2012, in the western province of Sichuan, where protesters .
The smelter had been the centerpiece of Beijing’s plans for industrial revitalization of the region, which was devastated by an earthquake in 2008. But , coordinated partly through the social media platforms that were then gaining popularity in China, resulted in the project’s cancellation. The authorities even released protesters who had been detained, after a large crowd on the third night demanded that they be freed.

The New York Times ,2019-08-23,Hong Kong Protesters Join Hands to Form Human Chains Across the City,918 ,"
HONG KONG — Hong Kong residents on Friday night formed human chains across large parts of the city in a call for direct elections, a test of the continuing strength of the monthslong protest movement and a display that recalled a major anti-Soviet demonstration from 30 years ago.
Participants fanned out across three routes over densely populated sections of Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories. Organizers said more than 135,000 people had participated, covering a total length of about 35 miles.
The plans developed quickly online this week after , a sign that protesters had not been dissuaded by a police ban or warnings from the Chinese government.
Participants on Friday sang protest songs and chanted slogans. While many joined hands, others held up their cellphones to illuminate the lines of people. Several held signs with flags of foreign nations and the phrase, “Thank you for supporting freedom and democracy!”
They lined up along Victoria Harbor and on Lion Rock, the peak that overlooks the Kowloon Peninsula. They stood amid apartment towers and on busy shopping streets, beside drinkers spilling out of bars and office workers heading home after work.
“I want to deliver a message to the world that we are peaceful,” said Lee Kin, 29, an insurance company employee who joined the chain in the Wanchai neighborhood on Hong Kong Island. “Even though I support fighting violently against the Chinese Communist Party, if we can demonstrate peacefully, we can get more support from the rest of the world.”
The event followed a variety of protest efforts, including marches, petitions, advertisements in international publications and walkways filled with art, as well as more confrontational actions such as defacing government buildings, clashing with the police and blocking roadways and trains.
Elsa Lam, 44, a clerk in the catering industry, said she seldom joined protests, but had brought her 8-year-old son, Aiden, to the gathering in the Causeway Bay neighborhood.
“I came out with him today because I’m worried that he can no longer enjoy freedom of assembly when he grows up,” she said.
Paul Au, 62, the owner of a small record store, previously participated in several protest movements in Hong Kong, including after the deadly crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. None of those, he said, were as large as the demonstrations that have taken place this summer.
“We have shown today that we are very peaceful, so let’s see what they can do to us,” Mr. Au said after joining protesters in the Sham Shui Po neighborhood. “The whole world is watching, you know. The people who are right will win. Justice wins.”
A spreadsheet posted online asked likely participants where they planned to go, then calculated where turnout would be above or below expectations, in order to direct people to empty spots in the chain. In some places where the numbers were too large, the line snaked into side streets then back onto the main route.
The demonstration was a display “of the solidarity and unity of Hong Kong people,” said Joshua Wong, a prominent activist.
“The turnout today was really a surprise,” he said. “We just had less than five days to prepare the whole Hong Kong Way action. And people peacefully gathered. Just proves: No police, we have peace.”
Friday is the 30th anniversary of , when as many as two million residents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania formed a human chain to call for independence from the Soviet Union.
Avoiding the fate of the Soviet Union has been a preoccupation of the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, and other Chinese officials. During a 2017 visit to Hong Kong, Mr. Xi gave a stern warning that challenging China’s sovereignty “crosses the red line.”
The organizers have not emphasized the pro-independence sentiment of the Baltic protest that inspired Friday’s event. The Hong Kong protests began over a government plan to allow extraditions to mainland China. The proposal has since been shelved, but the lack of a full withdrawal continues to drive protests.
Demands have expanded to include amnesty for arrested protesters and an investigation into police violence. Friday’s protest raised those demands, with an emphasis on others: expanding democracy in Hong Kong and making the chief executive, who is now selected by a committee of about 1,200, a directly elected position.
“The great majority of participants in protests are not advocates of Hong Kong independence,” said Willy Lam, adjunct professor at the Center for China Studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “They have chosen this Baltic human chain as a symbol of unity.”
One widely read post on a bulletin board used by protesters said that while more militant protesters might find such an activity “silly,” it was important that they still participate.
“We are all Hong Kongers,” it said. “We shouldn’t divide into ‘militant’ and ‘peaceful.’ To win we must be more unified than our opponent.”

The New York Times ,2019-07-01,"Hong Kong Protesters Storm Legislature, Dividing the Movement",1602 ,"
HONG KONG — Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators marched in peaceful protest on Monday as Hong Kong commemorated its  in 1997, but the city was shaken by images of a smaller group of activists who broke into the legislature, smashed glass walls and spray-painted slogans in the inner chamber.
The split-screen protest offered vivid evidence that the divide in the former British colony is not merely between protesters and the Beijing-allied government — the protesters are increasingly at odds with one another.
On Monday, as activists armed with metal bars and makeshift battering rams were on the cusp of breaking down the doors of the Legislative Council, a group of veteran politicians sympathetic to their cause pleaded with them to reconsider.
Some were shaking their heads. Some were on their knees.
“Please ask if it’s worth it,” Claudia Mo, a lawmaker, told one black-masked protester. “Think about your mother.”
The advice went unheeded.
The confrontation made clear that the protest movement that has upended Hong Kong for months as citizens condemned meddling from the mainland is at a crossroads. Until now, protesters took pride in having no recognized leaders and using encrypted messaging to crowdsource their direction. But the pitfalls of that approach have begun to emerge, with protesters disagreeing over tactics and goals and lacking a consistent position from which to negotiate — even as the government toughens its stance.
“Now Beijing has a good excuse to become even more uncompromising,” said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political scientist at Hong Kong Baptist University.
On Monday, Hong Kong social media was filled with pleas for the protesters to return to nonviolent methods. And early Tuesday, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, condemned the violence and praised the police, who she said had exercised restraint.
“This violence and lawlessness have seriously affected the core values of Hong Kong’s legal system,” Mrs. Lam told reporters. “I feel very indignant and saddened by this and want to strongly condemn it.’’
For weeks, the Hong Kong protest movement had stayed on the high road.
[]
A few days after the police against demonstrators on June 12, protesters held a vast and peaceful demonstration of more than two million, even though the government had suspended consideration of             to mainland China. Since then, smaller demonstrations have continued, without seeming to alienate the business community or lose focus.
On Monday, the vast majority of protesters were once again peaceful. But the images that dominated the day were generated by the relatively small group of protesters who broke into the legislature.
The protesters now risk helping President Xi Jinping of China justify his desire for tighter control of Hong Kong, analysts say. Some say the protesters are overreaching, as they did during , when critics of the government rejected a compromise by Beijing and ended up with nothing.
The unrest was a sharp challenge not only to Hong Kong’s leaders but to Mr. Xi, who has sought to expand Beijing’s influence in the semiautonomous region but now faces a turbulent political crisis with no signs of abating. The protest on Monday represented a brazen defiance of Beijing’s rule and was a dramatic display of the challenge that the party faces in winning over Hong Kong’s youth.
The protesters’ rejection of the pleas of sympathetic lawmakers, as well, highlights their deep disillusionment with Hong Kong’s political system. Many are skeptical that lawmakers, even those who embrace their cause and attend their rallies, have their interests at heart.
Many young people feel that older generations have been too eager to compromise with Beijing and have allowed the Communist Party to chip away at Hong Kong’s freedoms.
Since early June, protesters, many of them students, have urged the government to withdraw the extradition bill.
Responding to pressure from protesters, Hong Kong’s leader, Mrs. Lam, . But the protesters remain unsatisfied, demanding the bill be withdrawn entirely and that Mrs. Lam resign.
[.]
Monday was the anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover from Britain to China in 1997, a traditional day of protest for people who oppose China’s tightening grip.
In the morning, Mrs. Lam clinked glasses of Champagne with other Hong Kong officials as they celebrated the 22nd anniversary, and watched on video displays as the flags of China and Hong Kong were raised in tandem outside the city’s harbor-front convention center.
But tensions erupted almost immediately. Hundreds of riot police officers used batons and pepper spray to beat back demonstrators who had gathered nearby. Many protesters were angered by the police’s response, and marched to the offices of the Legislative Council, where they used metal rods and carts to break the building’s glass facade.
At night, the protesters stormed into the legislature, building barricades inside and spraying messages on the walls calling for protesters who had been arrested last month to be released. “Murderous regime,” said one message.
The protest quickly became a broad repudiation of Chinese rule, with demonstrators tearing up copies of the Basic Law,and governs Hong Kong’s relations with Beijing, and calling for free and direct elections. One group raised a British, colonial-era flag.
“We need to let out our long-repressed emotions and to let the rest of the world know about this news,” said Kris Yeh, a 20-year-old protester who said he had helped smash glass doors and spray paint walls.
Protesters mostly cleared out of the legislature after three hours of occupation. Then a cordon of riot police charged to disperse the crowd outside.
The confrontation at the legislature divided the demonstrators. Some denounced the actions of those who crashed into the building. Others were less critical, saying they could understand the anger.
“I don’t support violence, no matter what, but I understand why people would do it,” said Emily Lau, a former lawmaker. “They are very frustrated because they say they have protested so much.”
Some argued that nonviolence had failed and that a more confrontational approach was necessary to protect Hong Kong’s freedoms.
“We have been too peaceful for the past few times, so the police think we are easily bullied,” said Natalie Fung, 28, who supported protesters with food and drinks outside the legislature. “The younger people are risking their safety and their futures for us.”
In Beijing, the state-run news media mostly ignored the protests. But they were perceived among some as a stark challenge to Mr. Xi’s rule, taking place on the 98th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
The unrest has put Mr. Xi, who has promoted an image as a tough, uncompromising leader, , as he grapples with the prospect of more clashes between the police and protesters, or removing Mrs. Lam, a chief executive whom he swore in two years ago.
Still, mainland experts said the chaos on Monday might give the central government confidence that the movement in Hong Kong was unraveling and could fade on its own.
“This movement has reached its end,” said Tian Feilong, the executive director of a research institute on Hong Kong policy in Beijing, citing the divisions between lawmakers and more extreme protesters. “It will cool down by itself.”
The political crisis might prompt officials to place even greater pressure on Beijing’s formidable network of sympathetic business executives, media outlets and civil servants in Hong Kong, experts say, such as by threatening employees of mainland companies whose children participate in the protests.
“Those elements will be pushed to the max to elicit greater compliance from the population,” said Victor Shih, an associate professor of political economy at the University of California, San Diego.
The movement now enters a period of uncertainty. Arrests are likely. Divisions are growing among protesters. Without a recognized set of leaders, the demonstrations lack a sense of focus.
Victoria Hui, an associate professor who studies Hong Kong politics at the University of Notre Dame, said a successful protest required some level of coordination, even if it was decentralized.
“It cannot be leaderless,” she said. “They need better coordination. It’s not worth it to court arrest.”

The New York Times ,2019-08-03,Protesters Start Three Days of Civil Disobedience in Hong Kong,1445 ,"
HONG KONG — Protesters in Hong Kong kicked off three days of civil disobedience on Saturday with a sprawling march that erupted once again into violent clashes with the police, as the embattled government takes a harder line against the pro-democracy movement.
Thousands occupied a major shopping district for hours, and some attacked police officers with bricks, gasoline bombs and paint-filled bottles. Deep into Sunday morning, streets in some of the city’s densest districts were convulsed by violence, clouds of tear gas and tense standoffs between protesters and riot police officers.
The occupations and continuing violence suggest that demonstrators are determined to keep pressing a broad range of demands for greater democracy.
This summer’s protests, which began nearly two months ago, have thrown Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese city, into its worst political crisis since Britain handed control to China in 1997. Hong Kong’s government and the police are under pressure from Beijing to restore order as the protests become more unruly and as demonstrators increasingly direct their ire at mainland rule.
The initial protests were prompted by opposition to legislation that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s unpopular chief executive, later suspended the bill and  But she has refused to withdraw it formally, as protesters have demanded, or to make further concessions.
The protesters are also seeking Mrs. Lam’s resignation, direct elections, the retraction of the government’s characterization of a  as a riot, the unconditional release of all protesters arrested and an independent inquiry into police violence against protesters.
Saturday’s unrest began with a police-approved march in Kowloon, a broad peninsula that sits across a harbor from Hong Kong’s main island. The march drew people of all ages, including some older people who chanted, “Protect our children!”
But some young protesters streamed past the official endpoint, marching south into Tsim Sha Tsui, a harborfront shopping area that is popular with mainland Chinese tourists. At one point, they removed a Chinese flag from a pole and tossed it into the harbor — a gesture that drew an  from Leung Chun-ying, a former leader of Hong Kong.
By nightfall, the protesters wearing hard hats and gas masks had brought traffic to a standstill and built barricades across some streets, forcing the area’s luxury boutiques and other stores to close.
Some protesters also stormed into a nearby highway and blocked the exit of a tunnel that crosses under Hong Kong’s harbor. Traffic resumed about an hour later as many protesters began retracing their steps north to the neighborhood where the march had started.
Other protesters stayed behind and surrounded the police station in Tsim Sha Tsui, a district that has rarely been the site of antigovernment demonstrations in the past. They threw bricks and glass bottles filled with paint, spray-painted obscenities on the building’s facade and set a fire outside the station’s entrance.
The police presence in Kowloon was light for much of the day, but in a now-familiar pattern, riot police officers appeared on the streets after 9 p.m. They fired tear gas into the crowds in several areas, forcing some protesters to disperse. Video footage showed police officers tackling some demonstrators to the ground.
In Mong Kok, the densely packed Kowloon neighborhood where Saturday’s approved march began, police officers beat protesters with batons, .
Standoffs continued early Sunday morning in several spots. The police fired several rounds of tear gas after clashing with demonstrators in Wong Tai Sin, a working-class residential Kowloon neighborhood east of Mong Kok, and expressed “strong condemnation” of violence there. The police  that protesters were hurling objects, breaking windows and damaging gates at public property.
Some protesters also threw gasoline bombs at officers, the police said, an apparent escalation in tactics. Others again briefly blocked the harbor tunnel to Hong Kong Island.
Just after dawn broke on Sunday, the police  that they had arrested more than 20 people on suspicion of a range of offenses, including assault and unlawful assembly. They vowed to take “resolute enforcement actions.”
“Police are capable and determined to maintain law and order and will not tolerate any violence,” the statement said.
Protesters said on Saturday they had been undeterred by the government’s move days earlier to  after clashes with the police. Rioting carries a possible prison term of up to 10 years.
“If I didn’t come out today, I’d worry that many more people might be arrested,” said Cliff Cheng, a flight attendant at Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based international airline.
“I feel both angry and distressed, because the more things we do, the more we are met with police suppression,” Mr. Cheng, 24, added. “I would be lying to you if I tell you I’m not worried about repercussions. But if we don’t have freedom, what can we do with a job?”
Saturday’s unrest was the latest flare-up in a flurry of near-daily and sometimes unruly civil disobedience actions that have targeted major roads, shopping malls, the transportation network and other public places in a financial hub that is normally praised for its efficiency and lack of crime.
On Friday night, a confrontation broke out in a rural satellite town in northeastern Hong Kong, as the police used pepper spray against a crowd gathered outside a police station where a local political activist, , and others had been detained.
The unrest on Saturday unfolded as thousands of supporters of the city’s pro-Beijing political establishment held a competing rally on Hong Kong Island, across the harbor from Kowloon.
In recent weeks, Hong Kong’s leaders have defended the police,  by saying that officers have acted appropriately despite the strain of weeks of protests. But that has only galvanized many in the protest movement and accentuated their demands for an independent inquiry into police conduct.
On Friday evening, thousands of Hong Kong’s civil servants , sending a powerful message of discontent despite stern official warnings to employees that such gatherings in the name of the Civil Service violated its code of conduct, which demands political neutrality.
Some at the rally said they were stirred to action by the delayed police response to  in a train station on July 21, contrasting that response to the swift arrests of antigovernment protesters.
Others have said they plan to participate in a citywide strike that protest organizers have called for Monday, which could place additional pressure on the government to meet the movement’s demands.
Mong Kok, the neighborhood where Saturday’s approved march began, was the site of  between protesters and the police that left several people injured and prompted the authorities to arrest dozens of people and put the district on lockdown. Those confrontations started after officers tried to shut down unlicensed food vendors and escalated when protesters set fires and threw bottles and bricks.
China’s central government initially ignored or played down this summer’s demonstrations, but in recent weeks the state-run news media has begun focusing more attention on them — effectively attributing them to malicious foreign actors rather than homegrown political problems.
This past week, the commander of the People’s Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong warned that violent protests that challenged China’s political system were “absolutely intolerable.”
The garrison also  that showed troops rounding up mock protesters in a drill, in which the army pledged to defend Hong Kong.

The New York Times ,2019-11-11,Ugly From the Outset_ Hong Kong _s Day of Widespread Violence,1235 ,"
HONG KONG —  was a city on edge on Monday following             in which one demonstrator was shot point blank by a police officer and one man was doused with a flammable liquid and set on fire after he scolded protesters.
At nightfall, both men were fighting for their lives in a city seething with resentments.
 have voiced outrage at police officers they see as increasingly resorting to force, and at a government they say has allowed them to            . Government supporters are embittered over the protesters themselves             and the damage it has done to their city.
Months of unrest have thrown the Chinese territory into its worst political crisis in decades, and if Monday was any indication, there is no end in sight.
Carrie Lam, , said the mayhem could “take             to the road of ruin” and denounced those who had set the man on fire as “enemies of the people.”
The shooting of the  set off outrage among many Hong Kongers.
The young man was shot as commuters, snarled by roadblocks set up by demonstrators, looked on in disbelief. One moment, he was standing on a corner staring into the end of the police officer’s handgun. The next, after several shots rang out, he lay crumpled on the ground in the middle of an eerily deserted intersection.
As blood pooled on the asphalt, a crowd of angry citizens surrounded riot police officers who had arrived as reinforcements. “Murderer!” some of them cried.
An officer doused the crowd with pepper spray.
Anger quickly unspooled across several districts in the city of more than seven million people, and the protests drew in both suit-clad office workers in the central business district and residents in working-class neighborhoods.
The other spasm of violence Monday took place on an overpass across town from the shooting. There, a middle-aged man reprimanded a group of protesters, accusing them of lacking patriotism for the Chinese motherland. He was set ablaze.
“Go back to the Greater Bay Area!” protesters shouted at him, using Beijing’s term for the region of southern China that includes Hong Kong and neighboring cities.
The Hospital Authority said that both the protester who had been shot and the man who had been set on fire were in critical condition.
On Monday night in Washington, the State Department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, said the United States government condemns “violence on all sides” and believes “the increased polarization within Hong Kong society underscores the need for a broad-based and sincere dialogue between the government, protesters, and citizenry writ large.”
Ms. Ortagus also suggested the United States may no longer grant Hong Kong a favorable trade status different from that of mainland China: “Hong Kong’s autonomy, its adherence to the rule of law, and its commitment to protecting civil liberties are key to preserving its special status under U.S. law,” she said.
Tensions in Hong Kong had been building for days, following the  who fell from a parking garage amid demonstrations.
Many protesters see the student as a martyr, casting his death as more evidence of excessive use of force by the police. They called for citizens to join in a strike on Monday, and to disrupt transit en masse during the morning commute. Events across the city, including classes at most of its universities, were canceled.
The scale of the transit disruptions was not as large as a citywide strike that . But the clashes between protesters and the police were intense by any measure; it was only             the police have shot a protester since the demonstrations began.
Notably, some clashes occurred on the fringes of university campuses that have in recent months generally been off limits to such violence. Protesters threw Molotov cocktails and glass bottles at police lines, while officers responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets.
Thousands of black-clad protesters also turned up for a flash mob-style demonstration in Hong Kong’s central business district around lunchtime, creating a starkly surreal scene in an area filled with luxury malls. Some used orange traffic cones, bricks and wooden poles to set up barricades on main roads.
On the side of a Giorgio Armani store, a video screen with an ad showing models parading down a runway was defaced with graffiti: “They shoot, they murder, they are well-paid.”
Protesters, some of them office workers in full face masks, yelled insults at police officers along the same lines.
“Shooting everywhere — you think you’re so cool?” one said to an officer, adding an expletive. “Have you killed someone yet today? Have you met your killing quota?”
Marcus Lee, a 26-year-old lawyer in a charcoal gray suit with a blue face mask, stood with a group of protesters who were shouting at the police.
“The gun wasn’t necessary, let alone firing shots,” he said, referring to the morning’s shooting. “You can see how people are reacting to this. They are angry. It’s just very ridiculous.”
In the Kwai Fong district, one v showed a police officer on a motorcycle swerving into a crowd of protesters, clipping at least one of them. The police later said the officer had been suspended from front-line duties.
As many Hong Kong residents prepared for their evening commute, the smell of tear gas lingered outside their office buildings. In an internal memo, the bank HSBC said that while it was still operating normally, its employees should “leave the office early and under safe conditions.”
The months of protests started as a fight over an extradition bill that many residents of the onetime British colony feared made them too vulnerable to mainland China, which resumed control over Hong Kong in 1997. The protests morphed into a broader call for democracy and police accountability.
Now, neither side seems to agree on what the future should look like — and .
On Monday afternoon, the police urged protesters to stop threatening public safety. And they defended their actions.
The authorities said that the officer who fired the three live rounds in the Sai Wan Ho area had acted in self-defense against protesters who had been trying to steal his revolver.
“We certainly believe our officer did not have bad intention to hurt anyone,” John Tse, a top police official, told reporters.
Mrs. Lam, the city’s leader, said the protesters were engaging in “wishful thinking” if they thought they could pressure the government into making concessions with violence.
“I am making this statement clear and loud here,” she said. “That will not happen.”

The New York Times,2019-07-15,Protesters Target Station Thought to Be Pro-Beijing,1365 ,"
HONG KONG -- As a television journalist was trying to record video of a protest in Hong Kong last week, the protest suddenly became about him -- and his employer.
Surrounding him, the young demonstrators waved signs in front of his camera that read ''Change channels!'' They also held up bottles of Pocari Sweat, a sports drink that has become an unlikely symbol of disdain for his news station, Television Broadcasts, better known as TVB. 
  TVB, Hong Kong's dominant broadcaster, has been singled out for scorn by protesters, who accuse it of a pro-Beijing bias in its coverage of the political crisis roiling this semiautonomous Chinese region.
  Analysts say TVB's reporting has largely focused on how the protests have disrupted Hong Kong's famed efficiency, while playing down the political frustrations that have driven people to the streets in large numbers.
  The tension between the demonstrators and the station, whose broadcasts reach about 70 percent of Hong Kong's population, touches on concerns that the city's status as a regional bastion for press freedom is being steadily undermined by the Communist Party in China, where media controls are strict.
  ''It is a notorious television station and it always doesn't show comprehensive facts,'' said Cheuk Ka-ho, 21, a university student who is active in the protest movement. ''We feel that over the years it has gotten worse as it keeps getting closer to China.''
  The protests began in early June, when hundreds of thousands marched against legislation that would allow extradition to the Chinese mainland. Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, has since suspended the bill indefinitely, but protesters, including on Sunday, have continued to demand its full withdrawal, Mrs. Lam's resignation and an independent inquiry into what they consider a brutal police response to some of the protests.
  On July 1, some demonstrators escalated the conflict by storming, vandalizing and briefly occupying the Hong Kong legislature.
  [A New York Times visual investigation suggests the police used excessive force in handling a previous protest.]
  In TVB, protesters have found another front in their battle for Hong Kong's future. They have organized boycotts of the network on social media and lobbied companies to withdraw advertisements from it.
  The confrontation on Wednesday, when the TVB journalist was surrounded, was not an isolated incident. Last month, protesters heckled another TVB video journalist, unfurling umbrellas to block his camera and chanting, ''TVB news, selling out the people of Hong Kong!''
  The protesters accuse the broadcaster, which has a virtual monopoly on free-to-air TV rights in Hong Kong, and a senior executive who was once a top Communist Party official in Shanghai of deliberately marginalizing their movement, a charge that TVB rejects.
  A Facebook group calling for boycotts of TVB has drawn more than 30,000 followers, and a petition criticizing the station has collected 100,000 signatures. Last week, the maker of Pocari Sweat, a Japanese sports drink popular in Hong Kong, pulled its advertising from TVB.
  TVB has defended its coverage as accurate and impartial and accused protesters of threatening its advertising clients.
  ''Pocari Sweat's comments are designed to please protesters, which equals to bowing to violence,'' the broadcaster said to a Chinese nationalist tabloid, Global Times, in comments that TVB verified as accurate.
  A spokeswoman for TVB declined an interview request. But in a statement last month, the station said it was deeply regrettable that TVB reporters had been prevented from doing their jobs.
  Hong Kong's media landscape has become something of a battleground for the social divisions exposed by the political crisis, which could widen as the mass protests continue.
  On one side is, essentially, TVB's core demographic: older, conservative Hong Kong residents, who tend to sympathize with the police and see the protesters as troublemakers. At a rally in support of the police in late June, some demonstrators assaulted journalists from other local news outlets.
  On the other side is a younger group, generally supportive of the protest movement and the pro-democracy politicians who are a minority in the local legislature. For them, TVB's coverage confirms longstanding fears about Beijing's growing influence over local affairs.
  Some critics refer to TVB as ''CCTV-B,'' a mocking reference to China Central Television, Beijing's main broadcaster of domestic propaganda. They point to TVB's vice chairman, Li Ruigang, a media mogul from mainland China and one-time senior Communist Party official in Shanghai, as evidence of Beijing's sway over the station. (Mr. Li's company, China Media Capital Group, did not respond to a request for comment, but he has previously rejected such suggestions.)
  The Hong Kong Journalists Association reported last year that mainland Chinese interests had direct control over, or stakes in, nine of Hong Kong's 26 mainstream media companies, including TVB, up from eight a year earlier.
  ''Even though ownership is not concentrated in just a few hands, most of them have the same boss: the Communist Party,'' Allan Au, a former TVB journalist who is now a media studies expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said of the city's pro-establishment media barons.
  Ever since Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese control in 1997, under a formula known as ''one country, two systems'' that promised a high degree of autonomy from Beijing, the city has distinguished itself from the mainland partly by nurturing the independence of its institutions, including the news media.
  While the encroachment of Chinese interests has raised concerns, Hong Kong's media landscape, to be sure, is still relatively free. Its journalists are among Asia's most combative, known to shout sharply worded questions at top city officials. Journalist groups have publicly opposed the extradition bill and accused the police of using excessive force against reporters who were covering protests.
  TVB, for its part, has been less overtly antagonistic toward the protest movement than the city's two pro-Beijing newspapers, Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao. But compared to news outlets with a pro-democracy bent, like the newspaper Apple Daily and the online platform Stand News, it has generally been skeptical of the protesters.
  The network ''focuses very much on disruptive behavior rather than on what they asked for, what they really want and what's behind that motivation,'' said Gary Tang, a media studies expert at Hang Seng University in Hong Kong, referring to the protesters.
  Critics note that TVB was the television outlet Mrs. Lam chose for an interview last month in which she compared dealing with the protesters to her own experience as a mother with a willful child -- an analogy that enraged many of the demonstrators. On July 2, when TVB covered the aftermath of the storming of the legislature, it focused on the damage to the building and, unlike other news outlets, barely discussed the protesters' demands.
  Mr. Au said TVB's closeness to mainland China was evident in the amount of airtime it devoted to reports about, for instance, President Xi Jinping's so-called Belt and Road Initiative of international trade and infrastructure links, at the expense of other types of reporting.
  ''This is by design: The serious reporters don't have enough resources and time to devote to serious journalism,'' Mr. Au said. ''This is what I call 'structural censorship' that confines the content without explicit censorship.''
  Privately, some of the network's reporters and former staff members say they have felt caught in the middle. They are sympathetic to the protesters but resent being targeted over coverage decisions they say were made by their superiors.
  ''Protesters accuse TVB of brainwashing its loyal audience,'' said Lam Yin-bong, a former TVB reporter who now works for Stand News. ''But these reporters and cameramen think: 'First, I'm on your side, and second, even if I'm not, I'm just doing my work in a professional manner.'''
  ''They would think: 'This is not my fault, so why are you targeting me?''' he said."
The New York Times ,2019-06-28,Hong Kong _s Protesters Are Resisting China With Anarchy and Principle,1559 ,"
The movement is leaderless but not chaotic. It self-regulates even as it constantly reinvents itself. 
HONG KONG — The protests that have roiled Hong Kong for weeks, combining vast marches with small guerrilla operations of civil disobedience, are not the radical development that some say. They are a natural extension of protests past — an upgrade of the 2014 Umbrella Movement’s peaceful tactics of occupation. And they are a natural reaction to changing political circumstances, including a proposed bill that would allow, in effect, the extradition to mainland China of anyone in Hong Kong wanted by the Chinese authorities. The Chinese government’s power grab is accelerating the metabolism of the city’s protest movement.
Most of the leaders of past protests have been sidelined. The , some pro-democracy legislators and other well-known activists have been imprisoned for their roles in the 2014 sit-ins. The so-called             in 2016 brought some participants, like            , lengthy sentences on rioting charges. Others are            .
But the absence of these former leaders has had a liberating effect on protesters today. People organize spontaneously using social media and Telegram. Without the old elites, a massive gathering can rapidly splinter or spin off into small, nimble side operations — as happened on Thursday night, when after a big rally calling for  this weekend, a few thousand protesters marched on to the city’s police headquarters. There is no recognized figurehead to issue instructions, and the people wouldn’t follow those anyway.
On June 21,  for the first time. They demanded the withdrawal of the extradition bill, as well as the release of protesters who were arrested following an earlier clash with the police and the withdrawal of any rioting charges, which could mean long prison sentences, against them. The foreign media’s favorite icon of the Umbrella Movement, Joshua Wong, who had been released from a short detention just days earlier, addressed the crowd proposing that it vote on an internet forum about whether to continue the siege or leave. It didn’t care for the idea or even much react to his presence.
Pro-democracy legislators, known locally as the pan-dems, aren’t calling for any specific action; their role in the movement is largely supportive and protective. During the night of June 11-12, the police tried to prevent people from mobilizing by going into subway stations, stopping young pedestrians and searching their belongings. As anger mounted within the public, some lawmakers rushed to the scene           . On June 21, Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung, of the Labor Party, stepped in to mediate after protesters held up a police van and heckled the officers inside.
Yet if the movement is leaderless and anarchic, it isn’t chaotic. It has guiding principles that allow participants to self-regulate even as the movement constantly reinvents itself. 
Among those principles is “” (“do not split”). Protesters use the expression to say that no one in the movement should condemn or obstruct the actions of fellow protesters they disagree with. People who oppose a given action should sit it out, but not try to prevent it.
The use of force, in particular, is a divisive issue. Some insist on the necessity of keeping the protests peaceful, so that they will seem morally legitimate and may gain sympathy from the broader public. Others — especially younger protesters or protesters who consider that the lengthy sit-ins of the Umbrella Movement failed — believe that some measure of force has become necessary; otherwise, the government will simply ignore them.
The “do not split” idea acts as a bridge between these two factions by promoting mutual respect for diverging views within the protest movement. Not everyone embraces this code of conduct either, but it seems to be prevailing so far. And with good results: The movement remains cohesive despite being disparate. The more radical protesters at the front lines have also largely behaved with restraint — rationally and tactically. They have provoked the police, sometimes forcefully, but not with outright violence.
There was a great turnout for the  on June 9 — about one million people, the city’s largest demonstration until then — but it also felt like something of a last gasp. That night, some younger protesters weren’t done and didn’t want to go home. They went to the Legislative Council building with no plan and hardly any equipment. They knew only that they couldn’t let the bill be passed — or even discussed, as planned, on June 12. If it became law, Hong Kong would never be the same.
It was the Hong Kong police that lapsed into violence on June 12, beating protesters and journalists, and firing off 150 rounds of tear gas against a crowd of peaceful demonstrators. The authorities have since said they were considering just five people on riot-related charges. Officers also lost control emotionally, throwing  and             at protesters and journalists. (Now there are             with the slurs.) A few days later, two million Hong Kongers marched again, once more against the extradition bill — which the government had suspended but not fully withdrawn — but this time also against police brutality.
The protesters’ most powerful weapon is the police’s own violence. Or to put the point more bleakly: If the police hadn’t been violent on June 12, would the bill have been suspended?
For years, only peaceful protests have seemed acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. But that’s because until recently they haven’t had to pay the full price for their opinions about politics in Beijing. 
During British colonial times, many Hong Kong people identified with mainland China, the motherland, and were deeply interested in developments there. But colonialism also acted as a shield. The British authorities quashed . And Hong Kongers could support the student protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989 without risking any reprisals. They were patriotic from a safe distance.
But after the British handed formal control of Hong Kong to China in 1997, and as political and economic pressure from China intensified, more and more people in the city have identified as Hong Kongers rather than as Chinese, Chinese living in Hong Kong or Hong Kong-Chinese. They have also increasingly borne the brunt of the Chinese government’s growing authoritarianism.
Hong Kongers are finally beginning to emancipate themselves from their old views. But the process is still at an early stage. 
Although two million Hong Kongers — another record — took to the streets on June 16 against the prospect of being subjected to Chinese law, not many would say that they want independence for Hong Kong. Even opponents of the extradition bill and  cling to the notion that “one country, two systems” — the principle that formally governs relations between Hong Kong and the mainland, and that is supposed to protect the city’s relative autonomy — still means something. But what is the refusal to be ruled by another state’s laws if not a call for self-governance or independence?
Hong Kongers may be bashful out of fear: The government in Beijing has made clear that it . But many people hold these somewhat incoherent positions because they are still in denial.
These contradictions will not last, however; they cannot survive China’s continued encroachment.
There is a lull at the moment. The police are staying put and officials out of view. Protesters are maintaining the pressure with small daily operations: momentarily disrupting public services, delivering petitions to consulates. They also seem to be hoping that President Trump can somehow pressure President Xi Jinping of China when the two leaders meet at the Group of 20 gathering this weekend.
But if nothing gives after the summit, if the Hong Kong government continues to reject the protesters’ demands, the situation will have to get more chaotic. People here know that time is not on their side. And Monday, July 1, is the anniversary of the city’s handover from Britain to China.
This a moment of desperate hope. One-quarter of Hong Kong’s population has marched against Mr. Xi’s attempt to extend the Chinese Communist Party’s absolute rule to the city. After that, how could things go back to normal?
China is likely to seek revenge for our recent audacity. But punishing Hong Kongers would only unite us further.

The New York Times,2019-10-20,Hong Kong Protesters Rally Despite Attacks and Police Ban,682 ,"
The Sunday demonstration, which follows 20 weeks of antigovernment protests, is a test of the movement's strength amid increasing violence
HONG KONG -- Protesters rallied in Hong Kong on Sunday afternoon in a display of the movement's continuing energy despite a police ban on the march and attacks on promoters. 
  Thousands of demonstrators gathered in Tsim Sha Tsui, a crowded commercial district on the southern tip of the Kowloon Peninsula, to march to West Kowloon, site of an arts district and a high-speed rail station that links the city to mainland China.
  They assembled along a promenade beside Victoria Harbor and chanted slogans while the protest anthem ''Glory to Hong Kong'' was played.
  The Civil Human Rights Front, the organizer of large, peaceful marches this summer they estimate were attended by up to two million people, applied to host the event Sunday. But the police rejected the application, saying that such demonstrations have often been hijacked by vandalism and violence.
  After that denial, the Civil Human Rights Front backed out of hosting the march, but one of its leaders, Figo Chan, and other pro-democracy figures called on people to turn out anyway.
  ''I'm not afraid of arrest, of jail, of getting beaten up or gashed,'' Mr. Chan said Sunday before the march. ''But I hope people understand that to fight for democracy, freedom and justice, we must sacrifice. We use peaceful, rational and nonviolent means to express our demands. We are not afraid of arrest. What I fear most is everyone giving up on our principles.''
  Another Civil Human Rights Front leader, Jimmy Sham, was attacked by men with hammers on Tuesday in Kowloon. Mr. Sham is still being treated in a hospital and would not attend the march, the group said.
  On Saturday evening, a 19-year-old man distributing fliers to call on people to join the march was assaulted near a subway station in northern Hong Kong. He was stabbed in the neck and the abdomen, and is hospitalized in serious condition, the government said. 
  A 22-year-old man was arrested in the attack. The local news media quoted witnesses who said the attacker shouted that Hong Kong is a part of China, and that protesters were damaging the city.
  Chinese officials and the state news media have denounced the protests as a separatist movement. Some Hong Kong marchers carried Catalan flags on Sunday to show solidarity with the separatist movement in Spain. But while some protesters have called for Hong Kong's independence from China, it is not a focus of the Hong Kong demonstrators nor one of their official demands.
  The protests began over legislation, since withdrawn, that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China from Hong Kong. Hong Kong's top leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, said in September that the government would withdraw the proposal, but public anger with the authorities has remained high.
  The march on Sunday will reiterate protesters' other longstanding demands, including an independent investigation of the police, amnesty for arrested protesters and the introduction of direct elections for the chief executive and legislature. 
  The organizers have also raised two newer demands: a reorganization of the police department and the scrapping of a ban on face masks.
  Mrs. Lam used emergency powers this month to introduce the mask law. The move set off a wave of fresh protests and clashes with the police.
  ''I want to make best use of every chance to come out,'' said Anne Chin, 32, a clerk who joined the march. ''After the mask ban, we don't know when the government will invoke the Emergency Regulations Ordinance again and implement laws that may further muzzle Hong Kong people's rights.''
  The Hong Kong subway system, which has sustained widespread vandalism from protesters in recent weeks, closed stations near the march route.
  As the procession began, riot police watched and held up blue banners to tell participants they were violating the law. ''Disperse or we may use force,'' the banners read.

The New York Times ,2019-11-18,"Hong Kong Protests_ Over 1,000 Detained at a University, and a Warning From Beijing",1400 ,"
After a three-day standoff with the police, about 50 protesters remained on the campus of a besieged university.  
HONG KONG — About 50 protesters remained holed up inside a Hong Kong university on Tuesday evening after a three-day standoff between students and the police turned a prestigious institution into a battlefield and ended with hundreds of young people behind bars.  
More than 1,000 protesters who had spent the previous day clashing with the police were detained after heavily armed officers surrounded the school on Sunday and gave the protesters few options but to surrender and 
A number of students had escaped by rappelling from a nearby bridge to be whisked away by waiting motorbike drivers, while others failed in an attempt to flee through a sewage pipe.    
As much of the territory remained gripped by the drama at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the central government in Beijing on Tuesday condemned a decision by a Hong Kong court that overturned a ban on face masks worn by protesters.
The Hong Kong protests began in June over legislation, since scrapped, that would have allowed , and             for police accountability and greater democracy.
Here’s the latest:
A dozen protesters remain as standoff fizzles. 
Pinned in from all sides by the police, most of the campus occupiers had surrendered or fled the PolyU campus by Tuesday morning. 
By then, on the third day of a standoff, only 100 protesters remained inside. Several hours later, the remaining holdouts numbered around 50. 
The protesters — many of them high school and university students, and some armed with bows and arrows and homemade weapons — held the police at bay for three days in what became the most violent confrontation in six months of protests.
The battle at PolyU, in which the police fired more than 1,000 cans of tear gas and rubber bullets, represented the force’s most direct intervention onto one of the city’s university campuses.
Ted Hui, a pro-democracy lawmaker who stayed on campus during the clashes, escorted several dozen students out of the university on Tuesday evening. “This is not a surrender, and we are not turning ourselves in,” he said. “We are simply leaving.”  
The departing protesters were searched by the police, and those older than 18 were put into a police van to be booked. 
Mr. Hui, a member of the city’s Legislative Council, was not arrested, a distinction that he said “shows there is political selection in who they arrest and that there are arbitrary arrests.”  
The remaining occupiers said that they would not resist the police, but that they would not leave until officers entered the campus to arrest them. 
At least 200 of the protesters who left the campus were minors, Carrie Lam, the city’s chief executive, said in a news conference on Tuesday. 
Those under 18 were questioned by the police but were not arrested on the spot. They may still face arrest pending further investigation, Mrs. Lam said.  
She said the “special arrangements” for minors were intended to achieve “a peaceful and reconciliatory resolution.”
Video from inside the university showed an eerily deserted campus covered in trash and debris, a ransacked convenience store, boxes of unused petrol bombs, and the words “Liberty or death” emblazoned on a building.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority treated about 80 injured people from the university at emergency rooms on Tuesday morning. Another 200 from the campus were later sent to local hospitals. 
Separately, Albert Ho, a former pro-democracy lawmaker, said he had been assaulted on his route home from work. The motivation of that attack was unclear.
Most arrests on a single day.
About 1,100 people were detained near the PolyU campus on Monday and Tuesday, said Kwok Ka-chuen, a police spokesman. That figure would represent the largest roundup of protesters on a single day, making up almost a fifth of the total arrests since the protests began in June. 
Those arrested on Monday and Tuesday were charged with offenses that included rioting and possession of offensive weapons. Rioting carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, and many of the PolyU protesters were reluctant to surrender in order to avoid the charge. 
Mr. Kwok said that 1,458 rounds of tear gas and 1,391 rubber bullets were fired on Monday, putting a figure to the dizzying display of smoke and gunfire witnessed on the second day of the siege.    
At the Chinese University of Hong Kong, which was the site of clashes with the police last week, more than 3,900 Molotov cocktails were seized on Monday, representing the most found in a single location, he said. 
He called the prestigious university a “manufacturing base” for fire bombs. 
A number of protesters who had left PolyU on Tuesday, including several wrapped in emergency Mylar blankets, waited to be taken to a hospital. Some appeared to be suffering from effects of hypothermia after being struck by a police water cannon.
Beijing says it alone can interpret Hong Kong’s laws.
In Beijing, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress took the unusual step of criticizing a Hong Kong court’s ruling that struck down  in public, effectively saying that the central government alone has the authority to rule on constitutional issues in the territory. 
The Hong Kong High Court found that the ban, enacted in October, violated the territory’s mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law. In a statement released on Tuesday, a spokesman for the standing committee warned that the ruling “seriously weakened the lawful governing power” of the Hong Kong government.
The National People’s Congress, the country’s top legislative body, has the authority to interpret legal matters involving national issues — and to change the Basic Law itself. The timing of the ruling raised new fears of
“When the state loses, she changes the rules of game,” Joshua Wong, a prominent opposition leader, . “Beijing never intends to play by the rules.”
Article 158 of the Basic Law gives the congress the final authority over interpreting whether the Basic Law conflicts with national law. It also calls on Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal to seek the legislature’s interpretation in considering cases whose legal significance extends to national issues. 
The statement suggested that Beijing was prepared to act decisively to restore the mask ban, but the implications could be much greater, showing that there are limits of the national government’s tolerance  that has been a pillar of Hong Kong’s singular political and economic status.
In another statement on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Chinese government’s office that handles Hong Kong affairs also criticized the court’s decision to overturn the ban, saying that it had “a gravely negative social impact” and “brazenly challenged the authority of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee and the governance powers of the chief executive conferred by the law.”
New chief calls on public to condemn protesters. 
Hong Kong’s embattled police force, once regarded as “Asia’s finest,” has a new boss.  
Tang Ping-keung, formerly the territory’s No. 2 police official, was named commissioner of police on Tuesday after approval from the central government in Beijing.
In an interview with the , Mr. Tang blamed the public for tolerating the protests and encouraging their violent acts. “If everyone had come out earlier to condemn the violence, society would not have turned into this state in five months,” he said. 
“We can only end the unrest with society’s condemnation, reflection by the rioters, plus our appropriate tactics,” he added.
Mr. Tang also rejected a key demand of the protesters: setting up an independent commission to investigate police conduct during the protests.
“Our staff might think they are being particularly targeted if the well-established mechanism is bypassed,” he told the Post. “We will be disappointed.”

The New York Times ,2019-06-16,Huge Turnout by Protesters Keeps Heat on Hong Kong _s Leader,2073 ,"
A protest attended by a surprisingly large number of people culminated with demonstrators converging on the streets and grounds of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council.  
[Protesters rejected the apology of Hong Kong’s leader on Sunday, and presented a list of demands. .]
Faced with public anger, the city’s leader makes a rare apology.
Hong Kong’s chief executive apologized to the public on Sunday after a surprisingly large and defiant crowd poured onto the streets and converged on government offices. The protest capped a week of heated protests and soul-searching questions about the city’s ability to maintain some semblance of autonomy from mainland China. 
Many opponents of an unpopular bill, slated to allow extraditions to mainland China, focused their anger on the territory’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, who insisted on pushing through the legislation despite a public outcry that grew into a series of massive protests. On Saturday, Mrs. Lam backed down and indefinitely suspended the bill but refused to apologize. 
That was not enough for many protesters who filled the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday and surrounded the Legislative Council. Organizers said nearly two million people joined the rally, while the police estimated that 338,000 protesters turned up at the peak of the demonstration along a previously agreed-upon procession route, implying that its count did not include people who spilled over on to adjacent and parallel roads.
Six hours after the protest started, the government said in a statement that Mrs. Lam admitted that inadequacies in the government’s work had disappointed and saddened the public. 
“The Chief Executive apologizes to Hong Kong citizens for this, and promises that she will take on criticisms in the most sincere and humble way, striving to improve and serve the general public,” the statement said.
The statement struck a more conciliatory tone than Mrs. Lam’s previous remarks made at a news conference on Saturday, but it was unclear whether the apology, delivered in a written statement, would be enough to pacify the protesters. 
As word of Mrs. Lam’s statement spread among the protesters, many said they were disappointed and called her words insincere, noting that Mrs. Lam did not say she would fully withdraw the bill as demonstrators have demanded. 
“She doesn’t have the guts to face the public,” said Bobo Tang, a 22-year-old student. “She’s just trying to separate herself from the issue.”
Leo Cheng, 19, said Mrs. Lam’s remarks did not seem genuine. “She only did it under pressure,” he said. 
Emily Lau, a former chairwoman of the Democratic Party and still a leading figure in the territory’s democracy movement, said that she was not aware of Carrie Lam’s having apologized for anything before. 
“It’s the first time, but it is too little too late,” she said.
Huge turnout reflects people’s anger and distrust of leadership.
Mrs. Lam’s apology came on the heels of the third major protest to rock the city in a week. Protesters packed the sweltering summer streets of Hong Kong on Sunday, sending a clear message to Mrs. Lam and China’s central government: We are still angry.  
As night fell, thousands of younger protesters filled the streets around government offices and the Legislative Council complex, the site last week of a violent clash with the police.   
Many of the protesters occupied the roads near the legislature and even the council’s grounds, in a scene reminiscent of the 2014 pro-democracy Umbrella Movement protests that paralyzed the city for weeks. 
[]
“Carrie Lam, step down!” the protesters chanted, referring to the city’s chief executive whose proposed bill to allow residents to be extradited to mainland China for trial has been met with the largest protests seen in the semiautonomous territory in years. 
The crowd remained peaceful but the mood was palpably tense. 
Earlier in the day, a sea of people, uniformly dressed in black, stretched for more than a mile through the center of the city. In places, the streets were so congested people were forced to inch along instead of marching. The subways were packed, leading to several stations on one route being shut down.
“I want to give feedback that the Hong Kong people don’t trust the Chinese government,” said Kenneth Wong, 23, a window display designer who held a sign calling for the extradition bill to be withdrawn. 
“Hong Kong people, we stand together,” he said. “We all have the same message. We don’t want this bill. We want Carrie Lam to step down.”
Protesters denounce the police’s response.
The demonstrators chanted new demands on Sunday, highlighting a shift in anger over the extradition bill to how the government has responded:  “Withdraw the bill!” “We are not rioters!” “Release the arrested students!”
Among other things, demonstrators condemned the police for using tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper spray to disperse protesters on Wednesday. 
They also demanded that arrested demonstrators be released and called on the government to cease referring to the protests as “riots,” which could have serious legal ramifications for those who have been detained.
Many people on Sunday carried photos of bloodied demonstrators or images of the police deploying pepper spray and signs that read “Don’t kill us.”
Anthony Tam, a 40-year-old engineer marched with his wife and two daughters, a 6-year-old and a 9-year-old, because he was angered by the police’s use of force against protesters on Wednesday.
“Even if the police calls it rioting, they used a minority group’s behavior as justification to use force against a crowd of largely peaceful protesters. It’s repulsive,” Mr. Tam said, adding that he had been raised to be apolitical and that this was his first protest. “I am a Hong Konger, born and raised, and it has become a place I do not recognize anymore.”
Pan Chow, a 30-year-old office worker, said many people in Hong Kong had been shocked when riot police used tear gas on protesters back in 2014. “But the police was very prepared to use much more intense methods to clear protests this time,” he said. “I cannot accept that this is becoming the standard and expected response.” 
The police have arrested 11 people in relation to the protests in the past week, but have not said whether they would open an investigation into the use of force by their officers.
Protesters held a vigil where a protester died.
They came bearing white lilies, sticks of incense and offerings of whiskey and beer. They cried, they knelt and they said prayers. They vowed to continue to fight.
Tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents paid tribute on Sunday to a man most did not know, a 35-year-old protester who fell to his death outside an upscale mall late Saturday after unfurling a banner that denounced the extradition bill. The police characterized his death as a suicide. 
The man was a mystery to many, an ordinary protester who was identified by the police only by his surname, Leung. But this much, the protesters knew: He wore a yellow raincoat.
The raincoat, and the harsh criticisms of the government inscribed on its back, became a motif in the demonstrations on Sunday. 
Mr. Leung had been perched for hours on Saturday on the roof of a mall near the Hong Kong government complex. Shortly after 9 p.m., he climbed onto scaffolding on the side of the building, the authorities said. But as firefighters tried to rescue him, he fell, according to the police, landing next to an inflatable air cushion that had been set up to catch him. He was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.
Many protesters carried flowers to mourn Mr. Leung, whom they referred to as a “warrior,” “hero” and “martyr.” They chanted his slogans, calling the police “coldblooded” and saying that Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, was “killing” the city. Some wore yellow raincoats in his honor.
At night, protesters held a vigil for the man, holding candles and waving mobile phone flashlights. Perry Chan, an artist, stood with an easel painting an image of the crowd. In one corner of the painting was the now widely-shared image of the man in the yellow raincoat.
Emily Liu, a banker originally from mainland China, took her five-year-old son to the memorial because she wanted to show him what was at stake in the battle over the extradition bill, she said.
“If we don’t persist in speaking out today,” Ms. Liu said, “then tomorrow we will not have the opportunity to take to the streets or to speak out again.”
Who’s leading the protests? Everyone and no one.
Who’s the next Joshua Wong? There may not be one.
Many have compared this week’s demonstrations and civil disobedience to the Umbrella Movement of 2014, when protesters led by Mr. Wong, who was then a teenager, occupied major commercial districts for almost three months to demand a greater voice in Hong Kong’s affairs.
But this time, the protesters do not appear to have a clear leader.
Demonstrations by an overwhelmingly young crowd on Wednesday were organized largely through social media, word of mouth and . As of Sunday morning, no single organizer had emerged as the students’ leader.
That may be because Mr. Wong and other leaders of the Umbrella Movement . (Mr. Wong’s political party, Demosisto, said Mr. Wong would be released on Monday morning after            .) 
“Who’s going to be quite so willing, openly, to take six years of jail as the prize for the protests?” said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy Hong Kong lawmaker.
Andrew Junker, a sociologist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who has studied the Umbrella Movement, said one challenge for protesters without a leader is knowing when to declare victory.
“It’s the weakness of being so decentralized and leaderless and egalitarian and spontaneous,” he said.
Students have drawn other lessons from the 2014 demonstrations, making them much better prepared this time, said Leung Yiu-Ting, student union president at Hong Kong Education University. Factions that differed over strategy in the past have stopped attacking each other and learned to cooperate, he said.
“We are all finding our own ways to resist the government,” Mr. Leung said. “All our lives are at stake, so this is a sign that the Hong Kong people can stand together to fight something that is not right.”
Extradition bill at center of protests is suspended, but not withdrawn.
In a remarkable reversal, Mrs. Lam said on Saturday that she would .
[The bill’s suspension is  under President Xi Jinping.] 
Ms. Lam, who took over as Hong Kong’s leader in 2017 with the support of Beijing, had vowed to ensure the bill’s approval and tried to get it passed on an unusually short timetable, even as hundreds of thousands demonstrated against it last week.
[Carrie Lam is known for .]
As pressure mounted, even some pro-Beijing lawmakers . While the suspension is a victory for Hong Kong protesters, Ms. Lam made it clear on Saturday that the bill was being delayed, not withdrawn outright. City leaders hope that delaying the legislation will cool public anger, but leading opposition figures and protesters say that is wishful thinking.
The Chinese foreign ministry and members of the Hong Kong administration aligned with Beijing have repeatedly said the protests are part of a “foreign influence” campaign, pointing to recent statements made by Western leaders in support of the demonstrators, as well as earlier meetings between Hong Kong democracy advocates and American politicians.
At least 40 people joined a small counterprotest outside the United States Consulate on Sunday, echoing the Communist Party line that the anti-extradition protests in Hong Kong had been engineered by foreign governments hostile to China.
Stanley Ng, chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions and one of the counterprotesters outside the United States Consulate on Sunday, described the anti-extradition protesters as “rioters.”
“We, as parents, are very worried that our children will continue to be dragged into the team of rioters to take part in the riots,” he said.

The New York Times,2019-10-10,Apple Removes App That Tracked Hong Kong Police,318 ,"
SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple removed an app on Wednesday that enabled protesters in Hong Kong to track police, a day after facing intense criticism from Chinese state media for it, plunging the technology giant deeper into the increasingly politicized atmosphere in China.
Apple said it was removing the app, called HKmap.live, from its iPhone App Store just days after approving it because authorities in Hong Kong said protesters were using it to attack police there. 
  A day earlier, People's Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, published an editorial that accused Apple of aiding ''rioters'' in Hong Kong. ''Letting poisonous software have its way is a betrayal of the Chinese people's feelings,'' said the article, which was written under a pseudonym, ''Calming the Waves.''
  ''The app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,'' Apple said in a statement late Wednesday. ''This app violates our guidelines and local laws.''
  Apple's reversal on the app comes amid the backdrop of intense pressure from the Chinese government on multinational companies to stay out of the continuing protests in Hong Kong. China this week canceled broadcasts of exhibition N.B.A. games in China after the general manager of the Houston Rockets tweeted in support of the protests.
  Apple also removed the app after recently pulling the app of the American news organization Quartz from the App Store in China. Quartz has been covering the Hong Kong protests.

The New York Times ,2019-10-07,Hong Kong _s Hard-Core Protesters Take Justice Into Their Own Hands,1301 ,"
HONG KONG — When  this weekend came upon an older, shirtless man who was threatening a crowd, they pounded him to the ground with a stick. When a taxi swerved into a group of protesters nearby, some dragged the driver out and beat him until he was covered in blood.
And a few blocks away,  punched a Hong Kong actress who has publicly supported the police — apparently because she had been taking photos of protesters who were vandalizing a bank.
“Go back to the mainland!” the protesters yelled as she left the scene.
A confrontational core of  antigovernment protesters have            , attacking individuals and smashing and torching storefronts, banks, cafes and subway entrances. In a strikingly personal affront, one group even delivered a severed pig’s head to a police officer’s wedding banquet.
For months, the protests, which began out of anger toward a proposed extradition law but broadened to encompass a variety of demands, have been largely peaceful, but violence now regularly overshadows events.
[.]
The hard-line protesters see themselves as being forced to mete out justice in a system that lacks accountability and in the face of a government they deem unresponsive. Much of the violence has been , made worse after an officer shot a teenage protester in the chest with a live round during clashes on Oct. 1, the politically sensitive anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.
But to their critics, these protesters are crossing the line by playing the role of vigilantes to punish those they consider their foes. The intensity of the unrest could alienate moderate supporters and members of the public, and play to Beijing’s depictions of the movement as the work of riotous mobs.
“Some people began to take matters into their own hands,” said Ma Ngok, an associate professor of government at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He pointed in part to the protesters’ frustration that  pro-government thugs who attacked demonstrators.
Yet, he added, in recent days, the movement has been debating whether such retributive violence is morally justifiable.
The protesters describe vigilante attacks as “settling matters privately,” or “si liu” in Cantonese. On internet forums where rallies and gatherings are organized, some posts calling on the protesters to return punches have gained traction on the ground.
In their effort to retaliate against perceived injustices, hard-line protesters see few actions that are off limits.
A group of them showed up last month at a hall where an off-duty police officer was holding a wedding banquet and delivered a severed pig’s head. They also set off an ear-piercing fire alarm and tossed fake money at guests, turning a Chinese funeral custom into a deep insult.
One of the protesters who was there, Edward Hui, 20, said in an interview that the harassment is justified because the police are getting away with what the protesters see as excessive brutality.
“This sends a message to the police that, even if they are not held accountable by the system, they will be punished in their daily lives, and their loved ones too,” he said.
The decision by Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, on Friday to  at protests has only further angered the protesters, who see it as the latest example of eroding freedoms in the semiautonomous territory. Many who attended rallies on Sunday wore masks in defiance of the ban.
In the Mong Kok neighborhood on Sunday night, two men in masks who looked to be in their 20s or 30s punched a shirtless, older man who was standing in the street and arguing with a crowd.
The man tried to walk away after being hit at least three times — in the face, neck and jaw. But another masked attacker struck him on the back of the head with a stick, knocking him to the ground, and hit the man again.
In another confrontation, video footage circulating online showed a group of protesters pulling a taxi driver out of his car and beating him bloody after his vehicle had accelerated with a sharp swerve into a crowd.
Some protesters formed a circle around the driver in an apparent effort to protect him, but by then he was already bleeding profusely from his head. At least one protester was reportedly injured by the swerving car.
“Rioters blatantly launched brutal attacks on ordinary citizens yesterday,” the police said in a statement on Monday, referring to the beating of the taxi driver and other confrontations that day. “Such acts of violence by far overstep the moral boundaries of any civilized society.”
The protesters have also begun setting more and more street blazes, which send plumes of black smoke swirling through Hong Kong’s urban canyons. Bonfires at the entrances to subway stations have been set to show anger at the transportation network’s perceived support for the government. The fires have added a sharp edge to a slogan from the “Hunger Games” movies — “If we burn, you burn with us” — that the movement appropriated months ago as a challenge to the city’s political elite.
Many protesters and organizers have avoided overtly criticizing violence on the part of the demonstrators, asserting that any fracture in their unified position weakens their influence. But there were signs that more demonstrators were concerned that the escalation in violent tactics, even if justified to many, would undermine the movement.
On Sunday, a post on the Reddit-like forum LIHKG, used by protesters, urged demonstrators to resist the incitement to violence. The post, which was upvoted over 1,800 times, asserted a theory that internet commentators paid by the Chinese government could be pushing protesters to adopt extreme tactics to try to sow divisions within the movement and erode public support for it.
Another popular post in the early hours of Monday suggested that the protesters should dial down the use of violent tactics and stop their acts of vandalism. That post was also heavily endorsed.
But there are signs the public might be growing more tolerant of violence.
The Chinese University of Hong Kong conducted a survey of more than 600 people that found that the proportion of people who believe that protesters should uphold the principle of nonviolence had fallen to 70 percent in early September from 83 percent the month before. More than half of the respondents said that they could understand the use of extreme tactics by protesters when the government was seen as having failed to respond to public demands.
Wong Siu-fan, a 25-year-old logistics worker who has participated in several peaceful protests, said he believed the hard-line protesters were usually justified in turning to violence, but he was worried about its escalating frequency.
“It could make a lot of people feel that the protesters’ goal is no longer to resist the government, but to vent,” he said. “I’m not optimistic because the government is pushing protesters to extremes, and then afterwards using their actions to stigmatize them.”

HONG KONG — The Hong Kong police fired rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets on Sunday to disperse protesters after some of them vandalized the Chinese government’s liaison office in the city, a direct challenge to Beijing’s authority after a peaceful protest earlier in the day.
In a separate clash, footage from a local television station showed, masked men, dressed in white and wielding sticks, assaulted antigovernment protesters in a train station late Sunday night in northwestern Hong Kong.
The unrest spiraled out of a march that called for an independent investigation into in earlier street clashes. The march was peaceful, but thousands of demonstrators later marched past where the police had said the official demonstration should end.
Protesters then occupied major roads and heckled police officers stationed outside government buildings. “Recover Hong Kong; it’s the time for revolution,” some chanted.
By nightfall, some protesters had defaced a crest of the Chinese government at the liaison office with eggs and black ink, and had sprayed the building’s exterior with graffiti.
Shortly after 8 p.m., about 100 riot police officers, some carrying guns with plastic rounds, approached the liaison office and dragged away metal barricades that protesters had placed in the road.
“Charge forward!” they shouted, as hundreds of protesters fled east through the streets.
Scuffles soon broke out nearby, with some protesters lobbing eggs and bags of liquid at the police during a standoff outside the Central Police Station. After a group of protesters charged forward and threw projectiles, riot police officers rushed them, shooting several rounds of tear gas.
That same evening, at the , an unknown group of masked men in white attacked protesters and civilians, said Jerming Zhang, a 16-year-old student and first-aid volunteer who was at the station.
He said in a phone interview that as civilians, including those with children, tried to flee the station, the masked men followed them onto an open train and continued beating people with wooden sticks.
“It was like a stampede,” he said. “They hit people indiscriminately, smiling as they beat them up.”
In a statement on Sunday night, the Hong Kong government condemned protesters who it said had “blatantly challenged the national sovereignty by maliciously besieging and storming” Beijing’s liaison office. It promised to “deal with these acts in a serious manner in accordance with the law.”
A denounced the attack at the train station, saying “some people congregated at the platforms” and attacked and injured commuters. “This is absolutely unacceptable to Hong Kong as a society that observes the rule of law,” the statement said.
The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of China’s State Council also condemned the actions of the protesters who blocked the liaison office and vandalized it, and warned of serious consequences.
“Such acts openly challenge the authority of the central government,” the statement said, calling the actions “absolutely intolerable.”
The developments on Sunday were the latest chapter in the city’s  from Britain in 1997. They signaled growing antagonism between the largely peaceful protest movement and the front-line officers patrolling it.
“I hope that the police can take reasonable actions tonight,” Roy Kwong, a lawmaker who has been a driving force behind the protests, told reporters at the front lines early Sunday evening. “Otherwise, I fear that the anger of the people will erupt.”
The Civil Human Rights Front, which has helped organize the recent protests, said it estimated that 430,000 people had turned out for the officially sanctioned part of the march. A police spokeswoman said that the estimated number of people who had marched along the permitted route during the “peak period” was 138,000.
The police also said that they were investigating whether explosives found Friday at a “homemade laboratory” were related to the Sunday protest, but that they did not have enough evidence to make any conclusion. On Friday, the police said, officers seized about two pounds of powerful explosives, 10 gasoline bombs. and bullets and knives from an industrial building.
Three men in their 20s were arrested in connection with the case.
Hong Kong’s mass demonstrations began in early June in response to  to mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the governing Communist Party. The bill has since been suspended but not fully withdrawn, one of the protesters’ key demands.
On Sunday afternoon, thousands of protesters dressed mostly in black T-shirts set off on a march, some carrying signs saying, “No extradition to China” and “Stop police brutality.”
“The government must withdraw the bill and set up an independent inquiry committee to investigate the police,” said Tommy Tsang, an 81-year-old retiree.
He said he was particularly angered by the police violence. “If you don’t hit people, why would they hit you back?” he said.
Advisers to the region’s embattled chief executive, Carrie Lam, say her administration did not intend to make further concessions to the protesters. That stance suggests the government is confident it can weather the protests, despite the risks of damage to or violence between demonstrators and police officers.
Police officials say that they have largely acted with restraint and have used force only when attacked by protesters. They accused some protesters of rioting during recent demonstrations, including one in which a small group forcefully .
The police and a watchdog that monitors complaints against them have said they plan to investigate officers’ actions at a . Many people in Hong Kong, a city of about seven million, say they believe that the police response that day — which included firing tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds — was excessive.
But the protesters and their supporters argue that the watchdog is not independent and will not conduct a fair investigation.
At the Sunday afternoon march, the crowd spanned a diverse age range. “Everyone is out here for their children,” said Sam Tam, 57, who attended marches this month with his 8-year-old daughter and about 18 relatives.
“The older generation has to say sorry to the younger generation for not listening to their voices,” he said.
As the sweltering day dragged on, it was mainly those from the core demographic of the recent protests — young people in their 20s — who occupied major roads and swelled outside government offices.
Brian Heung, a student at the University of Hong Kong, said he and other protesters had intentionally disobeyed the police out of a sense of desperation.
“We have done everything peacefully, and they don’t have a proper response,” Mr. Heung, 18, said after putting a Post-it note on a barricade outside Police Headquarters calling officers shameless. “So we had to push the limits.”
Thousands of protesters at the front of the crowd defied police orders and streamed west into Admiralty, the district that houses the city’s legislature. Some heckled police officers, while others gathered outside the Hong Kong Police Headquarters nearby, chanting, “Shame.”
Demonstrations in support of the police have also been organized by pro-establishment groups, including one on Saturday.

The New York Times,2019-06-13,Escalation of Violence Underscores Anger and the Police's Resolve,1360 ,"
HONG KONG -- Riot police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets in downtown Hong Kong on Wednesday as they repelled tens of thousands of protesters who tried to swarm the city's legislature in anger over proposed legislation that would allow extraditions to mainland China.
The street confrontation began on Wednesday afternoon when a small number of protesters stormed police barricades outside the Legislative Council and hurled bricks, bottles and umbrellas at the officers. The riot police responded by firing rubber bullets, beanbag rounds and tear-gas canisters at the protesters. 
  The large-scale clashes -- rare in this financial hub -- underscore both the deep-seated anger that protesters feel about the erosion of liberties in the territory and the police's resolve to maintain order.
  It was a sharp escalation of violence in a protest movement that took off in earnest on Sunday when an estimated one million people marched against the extradition bill and China's growing influence in the territory. That march ended with small clashes in the early hours of Monday, but protesters began pouring back into the area around the legislature on Tuesday night ahead of a debate on the bill scheduled for the next day.
  Carrie Lam, who was selected by China's leaders to govern Hong Kong two years ago, stood firm on Wednesday against what she called an ''organized riot'' and said she would not withdraw the contentious bill.
  She also compared the demonstrators to stubborn children, in remarks made before the protests turned violent.
  ''If my son was stubborn and I spoiled him and tolerated his stubborn behavior every time, I would just be going along with him,'' Ms. Lam told a local television station.
  The widespread public outrage puts Ms. Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, in a delicate position. Retreating could make her look weak and risks drawing the ire of her party benefactors, who support the bill, but moving ahead with a vote on the proposal could incite even more protests and unrest.
  President Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House after the demonstrations turned violent, said on Wednesday, ''I hope it all works out for China and Hong Kong.''
  The officers fired round after round of tear gas on Wednesday, sending protesters fleeing, in a response that recalled the start of the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement five years ago. Back in 2014, the use of tear gas on student-led demonstrators prompted tens of thousands of people to pour onto the streets in anger.
  Demonstrators said they were shocked and dismayed to see tear gas used against them again. The police also fired rubber bullets into the crowd for the first time in decades, and wounded a driver for a radio station with a shot in the eye.
  ''These are not the scenes I want to see,'' said Phoebe Ip, 31, who took the day off from a marketing job to join largely peaceful demonstrations, but found herself dodging flying tear-gas canisters. ''We just want to communicate, but there is no way for us to talk with them. They just want to push us away.''
  On Wednesday afternoon, Stephen Lo, the police commissioner, described the demonstrations as ''riots'' and called on protesters to go home, warning that those who refused ''might regret your decision for your entire life.''
  With a volley of tear gas canisters, the police forced the protesters to retreat from the Legislative Council and into the streets. There, the protesters engaged in several skirmishes with riot officers, who hit them with batons. At least on one occasion, in full view of reporters watching from a bridge, one officer severely beat a protester who fell down during the retreat, steps away from the Legislative Council.
  The police had cleared some of the area by early Wednesday evening, but not entirely, and the smell of tear gas still hung over downtown. Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said that 22 people had been taken to public hospitals with injuries sustained in the demonstrations.
  Few in Hong Kong will believe that the demonstrations were riots, in part because they came on the heels of a mass protest in the city against the extradition bill three days ago, said Victoria Hui, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame who studies nonviolent resistance movements and Hong Kong politics.
  But it was strategically unfortunate for the protest movement that some demonstrators resorted to violence on Wednesday, Ms. Hui said, if only because it gave the authorities an excuse to crack down harder. ''A lot of young people, and not-so-young people, will be really scared of going back again'' to future protests, she added.
  The bill would allow Hong Kong to detain and transfer people wanted in countries and territories with which it has no formal extradition agreements, including Taiwan and the Chinese mainland.
  The bill has sparked anger in recent months across a broad swath of society in this former British colony, and concerns from around the world. Jeremy Hunt, the British foreign secretary, urged Hong Kong on Wednesday to ''pause and reflect'' on the bill.
  But the bill is likely to pass soon, possibly next week, because pro-Beijing lawmakers hold 43 of 70 seats in the Legislative Council. On Thursday morning, the council's president announced that it would not meet that day.
  The protests outside the council's downtown headquarters began on Tuesday evening with vigils and modest demonstrations against the bill, a day before it was to have a second reading in the council.
  By Wednesday morning, the multilane highway that runs past the council's headquarters and through a canyon of skyscrapers -- normally packed with businesspeople and patrons of a luxury mall -- was filled with a raucous crowd. Many were young people who wore black T-shirts and wielded tools to help ward off pepper spray and tear gas, including hard hats, goggles and umbrellas, the enduring symbol of the 2014 Umbrella Movement.
  Several protesters said in interviews that they had little hope of forcing the Hong Kong government to back down on the extradition bill. But they said they also recognized that it might be their last time to take such a public stand on incursions by the Chinese government into their way of life.
  If the extradition bill passes, ''they'll think you're a suspect and send you back to China,'' said Daniel Yeung, 21, a protester who stood atop a cement barrier wearing black clothing, a white surgical mask and green gardening gloves.
  Since Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, the territory has operated under a ''one country, two systems'' arrangement that allows it to keep its own institutions. But critics say that under President Xi Jinping of China, who came to power in 2012, Beijing's supporters here are chipping away at the independence of the territory's judiciary and news media.
  The demonstrators on Wednesday had support from across Hong Kong society. Small businesses across the territory closed their shops in solidarity, for example, and a hotel chain offered rooms where protesters could shower and rest free of charge.
  Carol Ng, the chairwoman of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions and a union representative for the Hong Kong Cabin Crew Federation, said early on Wednesday afternoon that about 30 flight attendants from Cathay Pacific, Cathay Dragon and other airlines were at the demonstration, albeit not as part of an official protest.
  Ms. Ng warned that the extradition bill, if passed, could affect ''each and everyone in the city,'' including passengers in transit at Hong Kong's international airport.
  ''No one is safe,'' she said.
  At some companies, including the marketing firm where Ms. Ip works, managers let their employees leave work to join the demonstrations.
  Ms. Ip, who was 8 years old when Hong Kong returned to Chinese control, said she did so Wednesday out of love for her city.
  But as the sun set over the Legislature Council, under the crackle of tear gas canisters, Ms. Ip looked weary and disillusioned. On her shoulder hung a towel that she had used to wipe pepper spray and tear gas from her eyes.
  ''This is not the Hong Kong I know,'' she said quietly."

Tsang Chi-kin, 18, showed no interest in politics until this year. After being shot by the police, he could become a potent symbol of the protests.
HONG KONG -- He was the kind of 18-year-old high school student more interested in basketball than studying. One of four student vice presidents, who classmates say never showed an interest in politics until this year.  
  Friends described him as charming and funny, with long hair he sometimes kept in a ponytail. Just another student. Not an icon. Not a symbol. Not a lightning rod. 
  But on Tuesday, the student, Tsang Chi-kin, became all of those things when he was shot by the police during a day of violent protests in Hong Kong. 
  The shooting -- the first time police officers in the semiautonomous Chinese territory used a live round against a demonstrator in nearly four months of protests -- represented a new escalation in the violence that has roiled the city.
  Mr. Tsang was shot in the chest. The hollow-point bullet narrowly missed his heart and spine, but pierced a lung. As of Wednesday, he was in intensive care but in stable condition, according to the Hospital Authority.
  ''He's a very fortunate person, when you look at the organs that are there,'' said Dr. Darren Mann, a Hong Kong surgeon and expert in ballistic injuries. 
  The teenager was one of many thousands of protesters who fanned out across Hong Kong on Tuesday and battled the police for hours through fogs of tear gas. The street brawls started just hours after Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, presided over a carefully choreographed military parade in Beijing to celebrate 70 years of Communist Party control. 
  The shooting, which has been replayed for hours on local television news channels, has divided the city. 
  Supporters of the pro-democracy protests say the episode epitomizes all that is wrong with a Hong Kong government that has prioritized brute force over genuine political dialogue. The movement's critics, on the other hand, say the shooting highlights the shameful excesses of a youth-led movement that has increasingly resorted to vandalism and attacks on police officers. 
  Seven friends of Mr. Tsang discussed the young man's activities, but insisted on anonymity because they feared retaliation by the police or others if their identities were known.
  Mr. Tsang, they said, was barely aware of politics until June when the first major protests against a bill that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be extradited to the mainland for trial convulsed the city. 
  The young man, they said, became more committed to the movement, regularly attending protests, participating in political discussion online and advocating for greater democracy in Hong Kong. 
  Starting this summer, Mr. Tsang played a leading role in a group of a dozen protesters from several high schools who attended protests together, his friends said. But a personal dispute last weekend led to a rift in the once tight-knit clique. 
  As a result, Mr. Tsang was with a half-dozen people at the protest on Tuesday in Tsuen Wan, a working-class neighborhood of residential tower blocks, when he was shot. Mr. Tsang and the other teenagers overlapped their open umbrellas to create a nylon wall as they charged the police, the friends said.
  In a video of the shooting, brick-throwing protesters chase outnumbered police officers for about two blocks, until a small group of officers becomes separated. A protester who appears to be Mr. Tsang -- wearing swim goggles and a gas mask and carrying a pool kickboard -- is seen leading a handful of black-clad protesters who chase a riot officer and knock him to the ground. They kick the officer and beat him with what appear to be metal pipes.
  When a different police officer approaches with a drawn handgun to rescue his colleague on the ground, the protester turns to him and strikes his trigger hand with a pipe. Instantly, the officer fires on the man at point-blank range. The protester falls, and is not treated for several minutes as the police watch for attacks, the video shows.
  The Hong Kong police commissioner, Stephen Lo, said the officer who fired on Mr. Tsang had acted in a ''legal and reasonable'' manner, having given a verbal warning before opening fire. The officer had been assaulted at close quarters, Mr. Lo said, and had no other choice but to shoot. ''The range was not determined by the police officer, but by the perpetrator,'' he said.
  Mr. Lo added that the police had arrested Mr. Tsang, but had not yet decided whether to press charges. On Wednesday morning, the principal and vice principal of the Ho Chuen Yiu public secondary school said that Mr. Tsang would not be punished and would keep his place in the school.
  Some supporters of the police and Hong Kong's pro-Beijing political elites urged the school to take a harder line.
  ''Could you not directly denounce his wrongdoing,'' Leung Chun-ying, a former Hong Kong chief executive, wrote on his Facebook page on Wednesday. Before being shot, Mr. Leung wrote, Mr. Tsang had ''beat the police on the streets in full gear along with other rioters.''
  Joseph Cheng, a retired professor of political science at the City University of Hong Kong, said the shooting could turn Mr. Tsang into a powerful symbol for activists on either side of the protests. 
  In less than 24 hours after the shooting, Mr. Tsang was being hailed as a hero and derided as a thug.
  ''I don't know if they were real thugs or students, but they all have been seriously brainwashed,'' Junius Ho, a pro-Beijing legislator in Hong Kong, said in a video broadcast on Facebook Live.
  Hundreds of people gathered in the upscale Central district at lunchtime on Wednesday. They chanted slogans and sang the protest movement's anthem, ''Glory To Hong Kong,'' as a show of support for Mr. Tsang. 
  And in a further sign of anger over the shooting, thousands of protesters occupied major roads on Wednesday evening in several Hong Kong districts across the city. Some of them threw firebombs at a police station in Tsuen Wan. A poster circulating on social media had called for gatherings in eight places at 8 p.m. to honor ''the wounded student.''
  In the Causeway Bay shopping district on Hong Kong's main island, protesters poured into a square in front of a shopping mall and sang the protest anthem, their voices reverberating in the mall's cavernous open lobby.
  ''When we saw the news yesterday about the student who was shot, you couldn't imagine why the police why would do that,'' said Max Lau, a 20-year-old university student who pumped his fist in the air and shouted along with the crowd. ''Why would the police do this to our young people?
  Mr. Cheng, the retired political scientist, said the shooting could propel Mr. Tsang to the kind of international prominence that Joshua Wong, a leader of the city's Umbrella Movement in 2014, achieved at a similar age. 
  On Wednesday, a group of protesters lionized Mr. Tsang at a news conference they held at the base of a 30-story public housing block in Tsuen Wan. It was across the street from the public high school and not far from where he was shot. 
  A row of masked protesters sat at tables and discussed their friendship and admiration for Mr. Tsang. One of them, a student, denounced the police and called for further protests to honor Mr. Tsang, saying, ''Please promise me that you will never forgive.''
  But recent alumni of the school said in interviews that the housing project was mainly occupied by older families who were strongly pro-Beijing. And not everyone who heard the protesters supported their message. 
  At one point during the news conference, a drone buzzed high above the apartment tower and strafed the crowd below with rotten eggs.

The New York Times ,2019-09-05,"As Hong Kong Protesters Push On, No Sign of More Concessions by Government",1286 ,"
HONG KONG — A day after Hong Kong’s leader  that set off months of protests, she gave no sign on Thursday that more concessions would be forthcoming, even as dissatisfied protesters planned to hold more demonstrations.
The city’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said she was optimistic that pulling the bill, along with other measures she offered on Wednesday, would help Hong Kong break its “impasse.” At a news conference, she called on peaceful demonstrators not to legitimize “the really violent protesters,” in what some saw as an attempt to divide the movement.
But there was little evidence that withdrawing the bill, which would have allowed , would satisfy even the more moderate demonstrators. Since the protests began in June, the demonstrators’ demands have broadened to include political reforms and an independent investigation of the police, whose use of violence in response to the protests has angered many in the city.
“I don’t accept this,” said Karen Poon, 31, a social worker who counts herself among the moderate demonstrators. “Anyone who has committed crimes, neglected their duty and abused their power throughout this incident should be punished by law, in order to uphold real justice.”
Ms. Poon added: “What everyone is defending now is not only the anti-extradition cause, but also the universal values of love and justice.”
Withdrawing the extradition bill had been widely seen as the easiest step the government could take to appease the protesters. The bill — which many Hong Kongers feared could expose people in the semiautonomous city to mainland China’s opaque judicial system — had already been suspended, but until Wednesday, Mrs. Lam had refused to formally withdraw it.
She suggested on Wednesday that democratic reforms could eventually be a possibility, under the right circumstances. But she dismissed the protesters’ other demands. She did not address them on Thursday, instead promising to establish a “dialogue platform” to address the city’s troubles.
Demonstrators said they would carry on with protests that had been scheduled for this week, including plans to disrupt access to the airport on Saturday and to stage various small rallies. Plans for large-scale marches were also being discussed.
Many hard-line protesters criticized Mrs. Lam’s move on Wednesday, saying it was “” Not long after her announcement on Wednesday, a group of protesters heckled officers at a police station in the Mong Kok area, aiming laser pointers at them and creating a makeshift barricade to block a road.
Around the same time, scuffles broke out between police officers and protesters at a subway station in the Po Lam neighborhood, and three people were arrested. A worker at the station was hospitalized, according to the MTR Corporation, which runs the subway system.
There were positive reactions to Mrs. Lam’s Wednesday announcement, including from several business groups. The protests have taken a toll on tourism, retail and small businesses, putting pressure on an economy that was already suffering from the United States-China trade dispute.
Robert Grieves, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, called the bill’s withdrawal “ to restore business confidence and the city’s international reputation.”
But there were also signs of broad dissatisfaction. Protest slogans echoed in housing complexes and neighborhoods across the city at 10 p.m. on Wednesday, in what has become a nightly ritual.
A joint statement from 11 Hong Kong student unions called Mrs. Lam’s move a “fatal misassessment of public opinion” and an “insult to Hong Kongers who have been fighting for freedom and protecting our basic rights.” On Thursday, student protesters formed human chains at several high school and university campuses.
Most demonstrators this summer have been peaceful, but a smaller group of more confrontational protesters have . In recent weeks, the police have deployed tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons against protesters, some of whom have thrown gasoline bombs and set fires in the streets.
Withdrawing the bill was just one of five demands from the protesters, and few expect all four of the others to be met, at least in the near future.
Democratic reforms would be a long-term possibility at best, and two of the other demands — amnesty for the more than 1,000 protesters arrested so far, and a retraction of the description of some protesters as “rioters” — are seen by some as potentially compromising the judicial system’s independence, although Mrs. Lam has the power to grant pardons and commute sentences.
But the demand for an independent inquiry into the police’s conduct appears to have wide support, including from . The police’s failure in July to stop a             on protesters and bystanders at a train station has been viewed with suspicion, and recent acts of violence caught on video — including officers’ use of pepper spray and batons against             last weekend — have stoked further anger against the force.
Mrs. Lam implicitly acknowledged that anger on Wednesday when she said she would add two members to an existing police review board and set up a panel of international experts to help with its investigations. But that board does not have subpoena power and is seen as dominated by government supporters, and critics said Mrs. Lam’s moves fell far short of the independent inquiry that protesters want.
“Setting up an independent inquiry is one of the simplest demands,” said Bonnie Leung, vice convener of the Civil Human Rights Front, which has organized several large-scale marches in recent months. “It is the only way that can make them be accountable to the laws and people again so that Hong Kongers can rebuild trust with the police and the government.”
Analysts have expressed doubt that Mrs. Lam would take such a step, which would almost certainly prompt a backlash from the police. The Chinese government’s strong support for the police would also be an obstacle, they said.
“It would become a major political issue if Carrie Lam did it,” said Ma Ngok, an associate professor of government at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “And I don’t think she has that kind of political courage.”
As of Thursday afternoon, the Chinese government had made no official statement on the bill’s withdrawal. Its main representative in Hong Kong, the Central Liaison Office, posted an article from a local newspaper on its website, with the headline, “Withdrawal is a sign of good will. Violence must be stopped with stronger determination.”
At her news conference, Mrs. Lam said the decision to withdraw the bill had been hers, pushing back on  suggesting that China’s leaders had been the real decision-makers during this summer’s crisis. “They respect my decision and they support it at every stage,” she said.
But some were skeptical.
“I think she was able to make this concession because she got the green light from Beijing,” said Samson Yuen, a scholar at Lingnan University who studies social movements in Hong Kong. “Otherwise, she would have done this long ago.”

HONG KONG -- Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators marched in peaceful protest on Monday as Hong Kong commemorated its  return to China in 1997, but the city was shaken by images of a smaller group of activists who broke into the legislature, smashed glass walls and spray-painted slogans in the inner chamber.
The split-screen protest offered vivid evidence that the divide in the former British colony is not merely between protesters and the Beijing-allied government -- the protesters are increasingly at odds with one another. 
  On Monday, as activists armed with metal bars and makeshift battering rams were on the cusp of breaking down the doors of the Legislative Council, a group of veteran politicians sympathetic to their cause pleaded with them to reconsider.
  Some were shaking their heads. Some were on their knees.
  ''Please ask if it's worth it,'' Claudia Mo, a lawmaker, told one black-masked protester. ''Think about your mother.''
  The advice went unheeded.
  The confrontation made clear that the protest movement that has upended Hong Kong for months as citizens condemned meddling from the mainland is at a crossroads. Until now, protesters took pride in having no recognized leaders and using encrypted messaging to crowdsource their direction. But the pitfalls of that approach have begun to emerge, with protesters disagreeing over tactics and goals and lacking a consistent position from which to negotiate -- even as the government toughens its stance.
  ''Now Beijing has a good excuse to become even more uncompromising,'' said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political scientist at Hong Kong Baptist University.
  On Monday, Hong Kong social media was filled with pleas for the protesters to return to nonviolent methods. And early Tuesday, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, condemned the violence and praised the police, who she said had exercised restraint.
  ''This violence and lawlessness have seriously affected the core values of Hong Kong's legal system,'' Mrs. Lam told reporters. ''I feel very indignant and saddened by this and want to strongly condemn it.''
  For weeks, the Hong Kong protest movement had stayed on the high road.
  A few days after the police used rubber bullets and pepper spray against demonstrators on June 12, protesters held a vast and peaceful demonstration of more than two million, even though the government had suspended consideration of a  bill that would allow extraditions to mainland China. Since then, smaller demonstrations have continued, without seeming to alienate the business community or lose focus.
  On Monday, the vast majority of protesters were once again peaceful. But the images that dominated the day were generated by the relatively small group of protesters who broke into the legislature.
  The protesters now risk helping President Xi Jinping of China justify his desire for tighter control of Hong Kong, analysts say. Some say the protesters are overreaching, as they did during similar protests five years ago, when critics of the government rejected a compromise by Beijing and ended up with nothing.
  The unrest was a sharp challenge not only to Hong Kong's leaders but to Mr. Xi, who has sought to expand Beijing's influence in the semiautonomous region but now faces a turbulent political crisis with no signs of abating. The protest on Monday represented a brazen defiance of Beijing's rule and was a dramatic display of the challenge that the party faces in winning over Hong Kong's youth.
  The protesters' rejection of the pleas of sympathetic lawmakers, as well, highlights their deep disillusionment with Hong Kong's political system. Many are skeptical that lawmakers, even those who embrace their cause and attend their rallies, have their interests at heart.
  Many young people feel that older generations have been too eager to compromise with Beijing and have allowed the Communist Party to chip away at Hong Kong's freedoms.
  Since early June, protesters, many of them students, have urged the government to withdraw the extradition bill.
  Responding to pressure from protesters, Hong Kong's leader, Mrs. Lam, suspended the bill last month and apologized. But the protesters remain unsatisfied, demanding the bill be withdrawn entirely and that Mrs. Lam resign.
  [Photos of the destruction in the legislature and clashes in the streets.]
  Monday was the anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from Britain to China in 1997, a traditional day of protest for people who oppose China's tightening grip.
  In the morning, Mrs. Lam clinked glasses of Champagne with other Hong Kong officials as they celebrated the 22nd anniversary, and watched on video displays as the flags of China and Hong Kong were raised in tandem outside the city's harbor-front convention center.
  But tensions erupted almost immediately. Hundreds of riot police officers used batons and pepper spray to beat back demonstrators who had gathered nearby. Many protesters were angered by the police's response, and marched to the offices of the Legislative Council, where they used metal rods and carts to break the building's glass facade.
  At night, the protesters stormed into the legislature, building barricades inside and spraying messages on the walls calling for protesters who had been arrested last month to be released. ''Murderous regime,'' said one message.
  The protest quickly became a broad repudiation of Chinese rule, with demonstrators tearing up copies of the Basic Law, a mini-constitution that took effect in 1997 and governs Hong Kong's relations with Beijing, and calling for free and direct elections. One group raised a British, colonial-era flag.
  ''We need to let out our long-repressed emotions and to let the rest of the world know about this news,'' said Kris Yeh, a 20-year-old protester who said he had helped smash glass doors and spray paint walls.
  Protesters mostly cleared out of the legislature after three hours of occupation. Then a cordon of riot police charged to disperse the crowd outside.
  The confrontation at the legislature divided the demonstrators. Some denounced the actions of those who crashed into the building. Others were less critical, saying they could understand the anger.
  ''I don't support violence, no matter what, but I understand why people would do it,'' said Emily Lau, a former lawmaker. ''They are very frustrated because they say they have protested so much.''
  Some argued that nonviolence had failed and that a more confrontational approach was necessary to protect Hong Kong's freedoms.
  ''We have been too peaceful for the past few times, so the police think we are easily bullied,'' said Natalie Fung, 28, who supported protesters with food and drinks outside the legislature. ''The younger people are risking their safety and their futures for us.''
  In Beijing, the state-run news media mostly ignored the protests. But they were perceived among some as a stark challenge to Mr. Xi's rule, taking place on the 98th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
  The unrest has put Mr. Xi, who has promoted an image as a tough, uncompromising leader, in a difficult position, as he grapples with the prospect of more clashes between the police and protesters, or removing Mrs. Lam, a chief executive whom he swore in two years ago.
  Still, mainland experts said the chaos on Monday might give the central government confidence that the movement in Hong Kong was unraveling and could fade on its own.
  ''This movement has reached its end,'' said Tian Feilong, the executive director of a research institute on Hong Kong policy in Beijing, citing the divisions between lawmakers and more extreme protesters. ''It will cool down by itself.''
  The political crisis might prompt officials to place even greater pressure on Beijing's formidable network of sympathetic business executives, media outlets and civil servants in Hong Kong, experts say, such as by threatening employees of mainland companies whose children participate in the protests.
  ''Those elements will be pushed to the max to elicit greater compliance from the population,'' said Victor Shih, an associate professor of political economy at the University of California, San Diego.
  The movement now enters a period of uncertainty. Arrests are likely. Divisions are growing among protesters. Without a recognized set of leaders, the demonstrations lack a sense of focus.
  Victoria Hui, an associate professor who studies Hong Kong politics at the University of Notre Dame, said a successful protest required some level of coordination, even if it was decentralized.
  ''It cannot be leaderless,'' she said. ''They need better coordination. It's not worth it to court arrest.''"
The New York Times ,2019-07-02,Hong Kong Has Nothing Left to Lose,1101 ,"
Inside the protests, I heard a collective roar of rage against a government that has failed, by design, to represent its people. 
HONG KONG — After breaking into Hong Kong’s legislature, protesters left a message for Carrie Lam, the city’s top government official, spray-painted on a pillar:
To the young activists, the storming of the Legislative Council was an act of desperation. Three times in the past month, tremendous numbers of Hong Kongers — at one point estimated to be            — marched peacefully to protest against a controversial extradition bill with China, which they fear would undermine Hong Kong’s judiciary and its freedom. The government suspended but did not withdraw the law. It did not even meet representatives of those who marched.
I was among the journalists covering the break-in of the building, and I watched as protesters ripped metal bars from the side of the building to smash their way through the windows. Their actions seemed like a breathtaking act of defilement of one of Hong Kong’s institutions.
Yet on closer inspection, I saw that they had zeroed in on certain totems of power. Inside the legislative chamber, someone had blacked out Hong Kong’s emblem — a white bauhinia flower on a red background. They had torn up the Basic Law, effectively Hong Kong’s constitution, on the rostrum. Above it, someone had spray-painted over the words “The People’s Republic of China” in black. There were other graffiti messages on the walls, including, “There are no rioters, only tyranny,” a reference to the government’s announcement that an earlier demonstration, broken up by police firing rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets, constituted “a riot.” But certain parts of the building, like the library, were left untouched. Notes reminded protesters not to damage fragile items such as vases on display. Protesters even left money in the fridge to pay for the soda they drank.
Ms. Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, has vowed to pursue the offenders and condemned their  Beijing criticized their            But this break-in had a clear purpose: It is a collective roar of rage against a government that has failed, by design, to represent the people. The Legislative Assembly’s composition apportions half its seats to business-friendly “functional constituencies,” ensuring that pro-government, pro-Beijing forces are in the majority, regardless of the results of legislative elections.
When those polls don’t produce the representatives Beijing wants, it has used the tools at its disposal to create a more pliant legislature. This happened after the 2016 elections, when a new crop of radical pro-democracy politicians was elected. Beijing then intervened to reinterpret Hong Kong’s Basic Law,  over the way in which they took their oaths.
When it comes to Hong Kong politics, it isn’t just that the playing field is tilted. The rules of the game, even the point of the game, are constantly being redrawn. By vandalizing the legislature, protesters have aimed their anger not just at one law but at an entire system that has disenfranchised them.
The vandalism may have alienated many moderates who had previously backed the movement. But I saw large crowds outside the building, who supported the aims of the protesters. They were not firebrands, but students, social workers and physiotherapists who felt there was nothing left for them to lose. 
That sense of impotence has been stoked by the failure of the Umbrella Movement in 2014, which sought freer elections but won no concessions after peacefully occupying key thoroughfares for more than two months. One young college student said bitterly: “The Umbrella movement was a big joke. Two months. Nothing gained. So that’s why Hong Kong people are gradually thinking we need to level up our actions.” As news emerged that the police would move in to the building, a young woman protected only by a paper face mask insisted she would stay on to bear witness. “We are scared,” she said. “But we’re more scared that we’ll lose our freedom.”
The protesters left around midnight, and police used tear gas to clear the streets, which had been occupied by some of the tens of thousands who had marched over the course of the day. Many questioned the role of the police: They had been in the Legco building but had suddenly disappeared, allowing protesters the chance to break in. Many suspected the retreat was a deliberate strategy to provide the government with justification to crack down on a “violent” movement. At a surreal 4 a.m. news conference, Ms. Lam, flanked by her unpopular police chief and secretary for security, did nothing to quell the suspicion. 
Throughout this hot summer of civil disobedience, Hong Kong’s leaders have been astonishingly tone-deaf. The image of Ms. Lam at an official 22nd anniversary celebration of Hong Kong’s return to China enraged protesters. She watched the official flag-raising ceremony — accompanied by two hated former chief executives — on a closed circuit television inside a convention center that had been surrounded by rings of security. Outside, protesters held their own ceremony, raising to half-staff a flag depicting a blackened, dying bauhinia.
No one knows what will come next. The protest movement could subside or split into moderate and radical camps. Or the escalating cycles of violence, followed by tear gas, could become commonplace. Much now depends on whether the government will respond to the voices on the street with action. The turmoil is already damaging Hong Kong’s institutions, its international reputation and its desirability as a home. That fear was voiced on another banner, suspended on a wall on the other side of the legislative building, which read,

Protesters had mostly cleared out of the Legislative Council building after three hours of occupation. Then a cordon of riot police used tear gas and charged to scatter the crowd. 
This live briefing has ended. 
Hong Kong’s leader vowed to pursue those who acted illegally.
After a day of protests that escalated in violence, Carrie Lam, the city’s embattled top leader, condemned the protesters who stormed the offices of the legislature and wrecked and defaced the building, vowing to pursue those who acted illegally.
“This violence and lawlessness have seriously affected the core values of Hong Kong’s legal system,” Mrs. Lam told reporters in the early hours of Tuesday morning. “I feel very indignant and saddened by this and want to strongly condemn it. I believe that the public feels the same.”
Mrs. Lam, the city’s chief executive, was accompanied by Police Commissioner Stephen Lo, who was asked why his officers made a surprise retreat as the protesters appeared close to breaching an inner door. 
Mr. Lo said the officers pulled back because there was a large number of protesters surrounding the building and they were limited in the level of force they could use in respond to a violent situation indoors. 
Officers decided to withdraw temporarily in order to regroup and take back the complex, Mr. Lo said. Later that night, several hours after protesters had stormed the building, riot police officers returned in large numbers and fired tear gas while advancing in tight rows to disperse the protesters.
It was an extraordinary turn of events in a day that began with an official ceremony commemorating the anniversary of the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China from Britain. In a speech at the event, Mrs. Lam pledged that she would be more responsive to public sentiment and would seek out different views. She was earlier that would allow extraditions to mainland China despite            .
In her comments on Tuesday morning, Mrs. Lam reiterated her willingness to listen. “I can say here, whether it’s pan-democratic lawmakers or groups of young people, in future days, I am very willing to communicate about the matters they care about.”
The broad public anger has already  the proposed legislation, but demonstrators want it to be fully withdrawn and have also turned their scrutiny on the police, whom they say             in dispersing a June 12 protest. Many protesters are also demanding Mrs. Lam’s resignation.
The riot police fired tear gas at protesters to disperse them.
Hundreds of riot police with shields and helmets fired tear gas after midnight on Tuesday at dozens of demonstrators who had set up barricades on the roads around the city’s legislative complex, after a core group of protesters had occupied the building for three hours. 
The officers banged their shields on the ground as they marched in tight rows along several main roads surrounding the compound, confronting the protesters who had gathered behind the makeshift barricades. Closely following the officers were nearly two dozen police buses with their lights flashing. The police fired several rounds of tear gas, sending most of the protesters fleeing. 
“Your actions have been seriously affecting public order and public safety,” the officers announced. “Please leave immediately or police will take further action.”
After the demonstrators dispersed, the police continued to hold a cordon on several streets. They entered the legislative building and searched the premises room by room for any remaining protesters. Other officers surveyed the damage and set to work dismantling barriers that the demonstrators had set up. 
Just hours before, the police had backed away from a confrontation with the protesters, clearing out of the building after hours of standoff in which demonstrators had been steadily destroying the facade and glass walls of the Legislative Council. The protesters stormed in, pumping their fists in the air.
Once inside, the protesters sprayed messages on the walls calling for protesters arrested last month to be released. “Murderous regime,” read another message. They built barricades inside using materials they had scavenged and brought, including umbrellas and metal gates and destroyed surveillance cameras. Then they filled the legislative chambers, defaced portraits of leaders and spray-painted slogans on the desks and walls.

“We need to let out our long-repressed emotions and to let the rest of the world know about this news,” said Kris Yeh, a 20-year-old protester who said he had helped smash glass doors and spray paint walls.
Another protester who identified himself as a 17-year-old high school student,  said he believed that more extreme tactics were necessary for the government to accept the protesters’ demands.  “There is no one here who isn’t scared of being arrested. I only have a bottle of water and a helmet, but the police have tear gas and pepper spray,” he said.
The protest was quickly turning into a broad repudiation of Chinese rule, with demonstrators tearing up copies of the Basic Law, a mini-constitution that took effect in 1997 and governs Hong Kong’s relations with Beijing, and calling for free and direct elections. One group raised a British colonial-era flag.
“I want universal suffrage!” one protester led others in chanting.
Other protesters said they wanted to force the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, to engage in a dialogue with them. 
Eddie Chu, a pro-democracy member of the legislature, told reporters that only the government and Mrs. Lam could resolve the political crisis roiling the territory. “If this is left to the police and Beijing to solve, we will face the greatest tragedy we’ve seen in 22 years” of Chinese rule.
The police and government said that they condemned the violence at the legislature and that officers were exercising restraint. “Such violent acts are unacceptable to society,” the government said in a statement.
Early in the day, hundreds of riot police officers had used batons and pepper spray to beat back protesters at a different site — near a government flag-raising ceremony attended by the city’s chief executive, Mrs. Lam. 
At the handover of Hong Kong to China’s control in 1997, the Chinese government agreed that Hong Kong could retain its justice system and protections for civil liberties for 50 years, under a philosophy commonly known as “one country, two systems.” Protesters today are angry because they see Mrs. Lam’s pushing of a bill that would open the way to extradite suspects to mainland China as giving up those rights to Beijing.

The attack on the legislative complex exposed divisions among the protesters.
Protesters who joined the demonstration outside the legislature said they were frustrated that the government was not listening to their concerns. “Friends, don’t leave,” read the signs many were waving. “People of Hong Kong, don’t give up.” 
This was the latest instance in which a group of predominantly younger protesters have taken measures that test the boundaries of civil disobedience in this usually orderly financial hub. In recent weeks, to protest the extradition bill and what they saw as a heavy-handed police response, the protesters have twice  and sought to disrupt government services. 
The protesters said they chose to descend on the Legislative Council because the police prevented them from getting close to the site of the government’s flag-raising ceremony that morning. 
[We reviewed hundreds of videos and photos posted online by witnesses to  used excessive force in June against protesters.]
Several protesters said that while they did not personally plan to break into the complex, they supported those on the front lines who did. Peaceful protest methods were ineffective, they said, and they increasingly felt open to a more confrontational approach if it would help to protect Hong Kong’s freedom and relative independence from Beijing.
“We have been too peaceful for the past few times, so the police think we are easily bullied,” said Natalie Fung, 28, who was outside the legislative complex supporting the protesters with food and drinks. “The younger people are risking their safety and their futures for us.”
Not all protesters supported the handful who attacked the Legislative Council. Several democratic lawmakers tried to stop the protesters by positioning themselves between the demonstrators and the building, even physically blocking the makeshift battering rams at times — but were eventually pushed aside.
Claudia Mo, who was among the pro-democracy legislators attempting to stop the protesters, said she thought the violence was an expression of how desperate the younger protesters had become in the face of a government that they thought had not done enough.
“I’m extremely worried because the young really seem like they have nothing to lose, when they have a lot to lose,” Ms. Mo said. “It’s their Hong Kong they’re fighting for. It’s their future and they need to take their future into account.”
The demonstrations are a challenge to China’s leader, Xi Jinping.
Huge crowds of demonstrators have taken to Hong Kong’s streets in the past several weeks, protesting a bill that would allow extraditions to mainland China. The protests forced Mrs. Lam to suspend the bill but demonstrators want a full withdrawal and for her to resign. 
The turnout of protesters on Monday was among the largest attempts to disrupt the Hong Kong government’s most important annual political event. It underscored the deepening anxiety that many in Hong Kong feel about the erosion of the civil liberties that set the city apart.
Monday’s protests, which also fell on the 98th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, were a direct challenge to President Xi Jinping and his increasingly authoritarian policies.
Analysts said the chaos risked giving Mr. Xi an opportunity to justify his tough approach.
“If it gets really violent, the risk is that Beijing has a good excuse to become even more uncompromising,” said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political scientist at Hong Kong Baptist University. “Xi can put even more pressure on Carrie Lam not to make any concessions.”
‘Carrie Lam, step down,’ protesters elsewhere chanted in a peaceful march.
Separately, hundreds of thousands of other protesters, including families and children, marched through nearly 90 degree heat on Monday afternoon to fill the streets of downtown Hong Kong in a separate demonstration calling on the city’s leader to resign.
Protesters carried signs saying “Free HK Democracy Now,” and “Hong Kong Fights For Democracy.” The march began at Victoria Park, where a few people handed out yellow signs urging people to “stand firm and investigate police violence.”
“Carrie Lam, step down, get some dignity for yourself,” said Lo Woon-fun, 84, who was sitting under a small umbrella in the muddy field at the beginning of the march. “I came out today because I want to tell Carrie Lam that despite my old age, I still come out to demand she step down.” 
“I have come here because of the future generation of ours. I want them to live a good life as I have,” she said.
Organizers said late Monday that 550,000 people had joined the march, setting a record for the annual event.
Members of the labor union for Postal Service workers carried a large printed banner that read: “When a million people walk against the mainstream, it’s inhumane to neglect it,” referring to a massive protest in June.

The New York Times,2019-10-04,Hong Kongers Poke Beijing In Digital Eyes,1257 ,"
The first major place in China to rebel against Beijing's technologies of control is one of the last not yet fully under their thrall.
HONG KONG -- There's no sign to mark it. But when travelers from Hong Kong cross into Shenzhen in mainland China, they reach a digital cutoff point. 
  On the Hong Kong side, the internet is open and unfettered. On the China side, connections wither behind filters and censors that block foreign websites and scrub social media posts. The walk is short, but the virtual divide is huge.
  This invisible but stark technological wall has loomed as Hong Kong's protests smolder into their fourth month. The semiautonomous city's proximity to a society that is increasingly closed off and controlled by technology has informed protesters' concerns about Hong Kong's future. For many, one fear is the city will fall into a shadow world of surveillance, censorship and digital controls that many have had firsthand experience with during regular travels to China.
  The protests are a rare rebellion against Beijing's vision of tech-backed authoritarianism. Unsurprisingly, they come from the only major place in China that sits outside its censorship and surveillance. 
  The symbols of revolt are rife. Umbrellas, which became an emblem of protests in Hong Kong five years ago when they were used to deflect pepper spray, are now commonly deployed to shield protester activities -- and sometimes violence -- from the digital eyes of cameras and smartphones. In late July, protesters painted black the lenses of cameras in front of Beijing's liaison office in the city. 
  Since then, Hong Kong protesters have smashed cameras to bits. In the subway, cameras are frequently covered in clear plastic wrapping, an attempt to protect a hardware now hunted. In August, protesters pulled down a smart lamppost out of fear it was equipped with artificial-intelligence-powered surveillance software. (Most likely it was not.) The moment showed how at times the protests in Hong Kong are responding not to the realities on the ground, but to fears of what could happen under stronger controls by Beijing.
  This week, as protesters confronted the police in some of the most intense clashes since the unrest began in June, umbrellas were opened to block the view of police helicopters. Some people got creative, handing out reflective mylar to stick on goggles to make them harder to film. 
  ''Before, Hong Kong wouldn't be using cameras to surveil citizens. To destroy the cameras and the lampposts is a symbolic way to protest,'' said Stephanie Cheung, a 20-year-old university student and protester who stood nearby as others bashed the lens out of a dome camera at a subway stop last month. ''We are saying we don't need this surveillance.'' 
  ''Hong Kong, step by step, is walking the road to becoming China,'' she said. 
  Hong Kong's situation shows how China's approach to technology has created new barriers to its goals, even as it has helped ensure the Communist Party's grip on power. 
  In building its censorship and surveillance apparatus, China has separated itself from global norms. Most people -- including in Hong Kong -- still live in a world that looks technologically more like the United States than China, where services like Facebook, Google and Twitter are blocked. With much of culture and entertainment happening on smartphones, China faces the challenge of asking Hong Kong citizens to give up their main way of digital life. 
  In the mainland, President Xi Jinping has strengthened an already muscular tech-powered censorship and surveillance system. 
  The government has spent billions to knit together networks that pull from facial recognition and phone-tracking systems. Government apps are used to check phones, register people and enforce discipline within the Communist Party. The internet police have been empowered to question the outspoken and the small, but significant, numbers of people who use software to circumvent the internet filters and get on sites like Twitter.
  ''One country, two systems'' -- the shorthand to describe China's and Hong Kong's separate governance structures -- has brought with it one country, two internets. 
  Undoing that is an ask that is too large for many. Apps like the Chinese messaging service WeChat, which some in Hong Kong use, in part to connect to people in the mainland, have garnered suspicion. Gum Cheung, 43, an artist and curator who travels to the mainland for work, said he abandoned WeChat last year after he noticed some messages he sent to friends were not getting through. 
  ''We have to take the initiative to hold the line. The whole internet of mainland China is under government surveillance,'' he said. 
  The Cyberspace Administration of China did not respond to a faxed request for comment about the impact of internet censorship. The Hong Kong police did not respond to questions about their use of surveillance during the protests.
  Beijing's approach has sometimes encouraged the fears. In recent months, playing to a push from China's government, Hong Kong's airline carrier, Cathay Pacific, scrutinized the communications of its employees to ensure they do not participate in the protests. Twitter and Facebook took down accounts in what they said was an information campaign out of China to change political opinions in Hong Kong. 
  The debate over why, how and who watches whom has at times descended into a self-serving back-and-forth between the police and protesters. 
  The Hong Kong police have arrested people based on their digital communications and ripped phones out of the hands of unwitting targets to gain access to their electronics. Sites have also been set up to try to identify protesters based on their social media accounts. More recently, the police have requested data on bus passengers to pinpoint escaping protesters.
  Protesters have called for the police to release footage showing what they alleged were abuses at Hong Kong's Prince Edward subway station in Kowloon in August. Hong Kong's subway operator fired back, pointing out that protesters had destroyed cameras that might have gotten the footage. Other than a few screenshots, they have not released footage.
  ''Trust in institutions is what separates Hong Kong from China,'' said Lokman Tsui, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ''The fast-eroding trust in the government and law enforcement, and concurrently the growing fear and paranoia about government surveillance, is what makes Hong Kong society more and more like China's.''
  Privacy concerns on both sides have driven efforts to maintain real-life anonymity. Police officers have stopped wearing badges with names or numbers. Protesters have covered their faces with masks. Both sides are carrying out increasingly sophisticated attempts to identify the other online. 
  Each even has a matching, if often ineffective, countermeasure to video surveillance. Protesters shine laser pointers at lenses of police cameras to help hide themselves. Police officers have strobe lights attached to their uniforms that can make it hard to capture their images.
  ''Of course we're worried about the cameras,'' said Tom Lau, 21, a college student. ''If we lose, the cameras recorded what we've done, and they can bide their time and settle the score whenever they want.''
  ''We still have decades in front of us,'' he said. ''There will be a record. Even if we don't want to work for the government, what if big companies won't hire us?''"
The New York Times ,2019-08-04,Hong Kong Protests_ Leader Warns of _Crisis_ as Strike Disrupts Subways and Leads to Canceled Flight,1577 ,"
HONG KONG — Hong Kong’s leader warned Monday of a “crisis” engulfing the city as antigovernment activists called for a general strike and rallies across the territory, leading to service disruptions on several subway and rail lines and airlines canceling more than 200 flights.
Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, has conceded little since June when she suspended, but did not withdraw, a contentious proposal that would allow extraditions to mainland China. The bill has prompted two months of protests and thrown the territory into its worst political crisis since Britain returned it to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
Transit officials reported disruptions to key subway and rail lines, including the suspension of service on part of the Island Line, the main subway line on Hong Kong Island, snarling the morning commute for hundreds of thousands of workers.
Protests were planned across the city, from outside the government headquarters on Hong Kong Island to Mong Kok, a dense urban district on the Kowloon Peninsula, and several locations spread across the New Territories to the north.
Several trade unions, including those representing Disney cast members and teachers, announced that they would strike on Monday. Informal groups of civil servants, aviation workers, construction workers, lawyers and finance workers also said they discussed plans to strike on Telegram, a social media app where many recent protests were planned.
Mrs. Lam said during a news conference Monday morning that the disruptions “have seriously undermined Hong Kong’s law and order and are pushing our city, the city we all love and many of us helped to build, to the verge of a very dangerous situation.”
“As a result of these widespread disruptions and violence, the great majority of Hong Kong people are now in a state of great anxiety,” she added. “Some of them do not know whether they could still take some forms of public transport while others are right now being blocked on their way to work.”
Her comments followed a stark government warning Sunday night,  of             that included the temporary blockage of a tunnel linking Hong Kong Island with Kowloon, that any “large-scale strikes and acts of violence will affect the livelihood and economic activities of Hong Kong citizens.”
“The now crisis in front of us is not about individual aspirations or about the bill,” Mrs. Lam said. “It is about Hong Kong’s security and safety and whether we could restore in time the law and order that not only the 7.4 million Hong Kong people values a lot, but I’m sure individuals sectors who still have a stake in this society would like us to defend.”
The mass demonstrations started in early June over the unpopular extradition bill but quickly expanded to include broader demands for greater democracy and independent investigations into the police and the government. Anger has built for years over stalled political reforms, threats to civil liberties and resentment over Beijing’s influence over the semiautonomous city.
Protesters vandalized the central government’s liaison office in Hong Kong, taunted mainland shoppers and, on Saturday, threw a Chinese flag into Victoria Harbor.
The Hong Kong government is under growing pressure from the authorities in Beijing to restore order in the city as the protesters have become increasingly confrontational and directed their ire more pointedly at Beijing’s rule. The Chinese government has hinted that the military could be deployed to quell the protests and state media reports in the mainland have more frequently denounced the protesters as traitors to the motherland.
The strike brings a new dimension to the protests, denting Hong Kong’s image as an efficient, hard-working city. The new tactics will challenge the government’s ability to respond. Mrs. Lam has been little seen in public in recent weeks, leaving the police force as the face of the government’s handling of the protests.
But the police force’s repeated use of tear gas, batons and pepper spray on demonstrators who have confronted them in the streets will be less useful in handling transit disruptions and job actions.
The protesters’ actions could undermine support for their movement, too. Some commuters were seen arguing with people who were blocking train doors on Monday, with riders saying they needed to get to work.
Others agreed with the tactics. Jason Mak, a 31-year-old who works in construction management, waited patiently inside a subway train and said that the long delays did not bother him.
“The government didn’t make response to the civilians’ demands so people have to do more extreme things. It’s reasonable,” he said. “There has to be some obstruction for things to have an impact.”
It was not immediately clear how many people would follow the call for a general strike. Some employers issued warnings, while others said they would tolerate no-shows. The Labor Department asked employers to “show understanding and flexibility” to employees given the expected traffic disruptions during the morning rush.
Joshua Law, the secretary of the Civil Service, wrote to the city’s 180,000 civil servants last week that he “absolutely did not approve” of civil servants gathering or going on strike. On Friday,  to call for an independent investigation into the push for the extradition bill and allegations of police wrongdoing.
The Hong Kong government warned last week ahead of the Friday protest and strike call that it would “seriously follow up on any violations of regulations” that restrict civil servants public involvement in politics.
Hong Kong Airport warned travelers Monday morning of potential disruptions and to check in with their airlines. More than 100 departing flights and 100 arriving flights were canceled by 9 a.m. The Airport Express train to the airport was also suspended because of protesters blocking doors.
Fred Lam, chief executive of Airport Authority Hong Kong, wrote to employees last week, urging them to “continue performing your duties professionally on Monday.” Some aviation workers , and an unsigned letter had circulated online warning of a “noncooperation movement” by air traffic controllers unless the government responded to the protesters’ demands.
The general strike is a political action and not a dispute between workers and management, meaning participants will not receive the already limited protections for labor actions in Hong Kong law, scholars say.
Employees who participate in the strike could face risk of punishment or dismissal, particularly if their employer warned against participation and they did not take a day of vacation or have an excuse, like a doctor’s note, said Rick Glofcheski, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong.
“Anyone on the general strike can be counted as being a brave person,” he said. “In the current political mood, there are millions of them in Hong Kong. But basically you don’t have any protection.”
Some employers have signaled they would tolerate workers’ absence on Monday, including the Catholic Diocese, the University of Hong Kong and Chinese University of Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, a pro-democracy labor group with 160,000 members, called on workers to strike Monday, while the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, a pro-Beijing group, urged workers, particularly those working in transportation, to work as normal to prevent the city becoming paralyzed.
Maggie Chung, a 32-year-old accountant who attended a rally at Kennedy Town Sunday night, said she intended to take no-pay leave or sick leave even though she had not yet passed the probationary period of her new job. “If I lose my job, I can find another one,” she said. “But if Hong Kong is lost, it’s gone forever.”
Many hospital workers said that they planned to work for the sake of their patients, even though they supported anti-government strikes.
“If we participated in strikes as front-line medical workers, our patients would be affected the most,” Dr. Arisina Ma, the president of the Hong Kong Public Doctors’ Association said at a rally for medical workers Friday. “Hong Kong civilians have suffered enough.”
Over the weekend, protesters called on the public to join the strike. “August 5 strike!” was chanted at demonstrations that spread over several locations on Saturday and Sunday. And even far from the crush of the mass gatherings, Hong Kong residents urged others to join.
Kathy Lai, 38, a travel coordinator for a media company, carried a sign that read, “August 5, I strike,” as she walked Saturday with her dog on Bowen Road, a popular running path in an upscale neighborhood on Hong Kong Island.
The strike is a way for middle-age people to contribute to a protest movement that has been led by young people, she said.
“We can’t send the children to fight with the police any more,” Ms. Lai said. “We are adults and we have to fight for the city more than the children.”

The New York Times,2019-08-18,"After Tumult, Hong Kong Gauges Support for Protests With Mass Rally",645 ,"
HONG KONG -- Hong Kong protesters gathered for a mass rally Sunday, a measure of the movement's strength after more than two months of demonstrations, days of ugly violence and increasingly vehement warnings from the Chinese government.
People began gathering in the early afternoon in Victoria Park, the starting point of vast peaceful marches in June that were joined by hundreds of thousands of protesters. The police approved the Sunday rally but objected to plans to march to the Central district, citing clashes that had occurred after previous events. But many protesters said they would march regardless. 
  The turnout was being closely watched as a gauge of public sentiment after several tumultuous days. One week ago, riot police officers fired tear gas in one subway station and chased protesters down an escalator in another. At the Hong Kong airport, days of sit-ins swelled to fill the main terminal, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights.
  The situation at the airport took a dark turn on Tuesday when protesters surrounded two men from mainland China, including one identified as a state media journalist, binding them and hitting them. That abuse provoked widespread condemnation from China and apologies from protesters.
  In recent days, the protests have quieted somewhat. The airport limited terminal access to passengers, halting demonstrations there. On Saturday, when protests were held at several places across the city, riot police officers chased off a few hundred black-clad demonstrators who had surrounded a station, but did not fire tear gas. The authorities later said a police officer had fired a bean bag round at a person who had thrown a trash can and other items at a police vehicle in the Mong Kok district.
  Entering the weekend, the repeated call among protesters was to prepare to rally Sunday.
  The protests began in June over a Hong Kong government proposal that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. That legislation has been shelved, though not completely withdrawn, and the demands of the protesters have grown to include expanded direct elections, an independent investigation into police use of force, and amnesty for arrested protesters.
  The Chinese government has criticized the protests in strong terms, calling the airport violence ''close to terrorism'' and warning that the military could be called in. Paramilitary police officers have gathered for drills in the nearby city of Shenzhen, and a video carried by state media late Saturday showed hundreds of riot police officers with shields and batons charging at men dressed in black.
  In cities around the world, including London, Toronto, Sydney, Melbourne and New York, protesters took to the streets on Saturday to show support for the planned demonstration in Hong Kong. One activist and organizer in New York estimated that at least 40 cities had planned similar rallies.
  In Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city, scuffles broke out between Hong Kong protesters and pro-Beijing groups. And in Sydney, supporters of the Chinese government denounced the Hong Kong democracy movement and shouted profanities at a handful of counterprotesters.
  In New York, hundreds of people dressed in black, including Alvin Yeung, a Hong Kong lawmaker, and Nathan Law, a prominent Hong Kong activist, gathered in Chinatown for a rally and then snaked over the Manhattan Bridge.
  At one point, demonstrators put their hands over their right eyes to show support for a woman in Hong Kong who was hit in the eye with a projectile during clashes with the police. Across the street, a smaller group of pro-China protesters waved flags and chanted nationalist slogans.
  Mr. Yeung, a vocal critic of the Hong Kong government, said it was important for people around the world to support the Hong Kong protesters. ''Hope is the only thing we have,'' he said."
The New York Times ,2019-07-03,Hong Kong Protesters Take Stock as Police Announce More Arrests,1362 ,"
HONG KONG — Hong Kong’s protesters tried on Wednesday to maintain a united front and take stock of the movement’s gains and losses, as the police said they had arrested 12 people involved in clashes near the city’s legislature Monday.
The arrests came after Beijing and the local government condemned a core group of young demonstrators who stormed the legislature on Monday.
The Chinese government has urged city officials and the police to restore social order and bring to justice those responsible for Monday’s protest, in which dozens of mostly young activists armed with metal bars and makeshift battering rams . The city’s leader, Carrie Lam, and the police have promised to pursue those responsible for the damage.
The Hong Kong police said Wednesday that they had arrested 11 men and one woman, with ages ranging from 14 to 36, on charges that included possession of offensive weapons, unlawful assembly, assaulting a police officer, and obstructing a police officer.
The alleged offenses occurred Monday morning, when protesters raised their own flag at the legislature and then tried to disrupt an official flag-raising ceremony at a nearby convention center. The police have not announced arrests of any protesters who broke into the legislature.
The forcible occupation of the legislature sent shock waves through this financial hub, known for its efficiency and orderliness. The question now is whether the largely leaderless protest movement can maintain enough unity — and public support — to push its demands, which center on a complete withdrawal of  to mainland China; or whether Monday’s vandalism will irreparably splinter the movement or damage its credibility.
The violence could deal a blow to the protesters’ efforts to retain the moral high ground in their dispute with the authorities.
The police also said on Wednesday that they had arrested eight people this week for disclosing police officers’ personal data online without their consent.
A police spokesman, Mohammed Swalikh of the police force’s Technology Crime Division, told reporters Wednesday evening that members of the police force had reported more than 800 incidents of harassment of themselves or family members in the wake of the release of their data, a practice known as “doxxing.”
His announcement came a few weeks after critics of police conduct began creating open-source databases in which users shared officers’ phone numbers and the names of their spouses and high schools, among other details, with some lists referring to the police as dogs.
The police also said Wednesday that they had arrested five men and one woman on charges of possession of offensive weapons, assault and fighting in a public place on Sunday, when supporters of the police rallied.
The protest movement is divided to some degree over how best to push its demands as some protesters have started engaging in more militant action. Many in the movement agree on what those demands should be — the full withdrawal of  bill, which Mrs. Lam suspended last month; the resignation of Mrs. Lam, the city’s chief executive; and the opening of an independent inquiry into reports of police brutality against protesters at an earlier demonstration. But the protesters differ on whether destructive acts help or hurt the cause.
The protests on Monday started out with a march that was intended to disrupt the Hong Kong government’s celebration of the anniversary of the territory’s return to China from Britain.
But the police beat back those protesters and doused them with pepper spray, and a core group of demonstrators later turned to target the Legislative Council. The police later said that during the confrontations, some protesters threw a toxic substance at officers that could cause itchiness and difficulty breathing, and that 13 officers sought medical treatment.
As the protesters bashed their way into the legislature, hundreds of thousands of other demonstrators joined a peaceful afternoon march calling for Mrs. Lam to resign.
Several protesters said they did not take part in storming the legislature but defended it as an act of desperation by demonstrators who felt that peaceful tactics had failed to persuade the government to meet the demands of the broader movement.
Billy Li, head of the Progressive Lawyers Group, an association of pro-democracy lawyers and students, said that while the use of unlawful force against property could legally be considered violence, the government’s emphasis on the protesters’ vandalism was politically motivated.
“They are using the protesters’ violence to shift the public’s attention away from their demands,” Mr. Li said.
Katherine Lam, a 39-year-old data analyst who joined recent marches, said she supported the younger protesters because they were exposing themselves to the risk of arrest.
“Nobody supports violent demonstration per se,” Ms. Lam said. “But these guys earned my sympathy and I don’t want to leave them alone as they put their life on the line and were fighting for us all.”
But as the protesters debated their next steps on social media, some raised concerns that a destructive approach — in contrast with demonstrators who had earlier been praised for cleaning up trash after huge rallies — would alienate the public.
Officials invited reporters to the legislature on Wednesday to show them rooms strewn with snacks, defaced portraits and graffitied walls. A few binders of confidential documents spilled from shelves.
“I think that this type of action will gradually drain the momentum built by two million protesters, because it clearly creates a riot-like impact,” said Candice Lee, 38, a social worker who had participated in previous marches against the extradition bill with her children. She said she believed Monday’s occupation would “cause peaceful protesters who have always been supporting them to part ways with them in disappointment.”
The discussions within the protest movement were occurring as pressure against it was building from the city’s pro-establishment camp and its patrons in Beijing.
China’s leadership on Tuesday  who had acted illegally.
Among those who pushed back against the condemnation was Anson Chan, a democracy advocate who was Hong Kong’s second-highest official until her retirement in 2001.
“Violence does not solve anything, but I think the chief executive and the governing team should ask themselves what has led to this degree of violence,” Mrs. Chan said. She said the cause was pent-up outrage over years of not being heard by an establishment that is more concerned with pleasing its backers in Beijing than with the interests of the city’s residents.
Hong Kong’s decision to push the extradition bill and its arrest of nonviolent protesters has started a war of words between China and Britain that has threatened to turn into a more serious diplomatic dispute.
The foreign secretary of Britain, Jeremy Hunt, denounced the violent protests, but expressed support for the peaceful ones, and threatened “consequences” if China failed to accord Hong Kong residents the civil liberties assured them under the terms of the “one country, two systems” agreement.
China’s ambassador to Britain, Liu Xiaoming, said the comments by British ministers amounted to “gross interference” in Chinese affairs and an endorsement of “violent lawbreakers.”
“I would like to reiterate that Hong Kong is China’s special administrative region,” Mr. Liu said.“It is not what it used to be under British colonial rule.”

The New York Times ,2019-10-24,China Holds #MeToo Activist Who Wrote About Hong Kong Protests,677 ,"
She spoke critically of China’s restrictions on free speech. Now the authorities are accusing her of “provoking trouble.”
BEIJING — The Chinese authorities have detained a journalist who was a leading figure in the country’s #MeToo  and had recently written about the             in Hong Kong, her friends said on Thursday.
The activist, Huang Xueqin, was detained last week in the southern city of Guangzhou, according to friends who asked not to be identified by name. The authorities accused Ms. Huang, 31, of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” a vague accusation that the government often uses to silence activists who challenge the status quo.
Ms. Huang is best known in China for her role in the country’s fledgling #MeToo movement, which achieved some success despite China’s authoritarian system. She helped dozens of women report cases of sexual assault and abuse online,  and a male-dominated culture. The movement took on            ,            ,             and others.
“We’re not brave enough to stand out as one individual,” she said last year in an  with The New York Times. “But together, we can be strong.”
Ms. Huang is now also the latest mainland citizen known to have been  for showing support for the Hong Kong protests. The ruling Communist Party has depicted the demonstrators as rioters seeking political revolution, and the police on the mainland have in recent months detained and questioned several citizens who have shared protest slogans online.
In June Ms. Huang published an  about her experience attending the             in Hong Kong against a bill, now withdrawn, that would have allowed the extradition of the territory’s residents to mainland            . 
She wrote that she was attending the rally “with the intention of giving voice to, participating, bearing witness and recording history” and criticized the mainland’s restrictions on free speech when she learned that her social media posts about the protest had been censored. 
Her detention has raised concerns among human rights groups who have denounced a broad crackdown on dissent that China’s leader, , has waged since rising to power in 2012. Dozens of            ,             and activists have been detained and many have been sent to prison. 
“It only shows how fearful Chinese authorities are,” said Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher at Human Rights Watch, an advocacy organization. “They are afraid that protests in Hong Kong could inspire challenges to the government in the mainland, and that anyone expressing ideas of freedom of democracy is a threat to the Communist Party’s rule.”
It was unclear precisely why Ms. Huang had been detained, and the police in Guangzhou did not answer a call seeking comment. 
Since February, Ms. Huang, who also goes by Sophia, had been traveling to Taiwan, a self-governing island, and Hong Kong, where she had planned to attend law school in September, her friends said. Chinese leaders consider Taiwan part of China. 
After she began chronicling her experiences in Hong Kong, the police on the mainland confiscated her passport in August and harassed her relatives, her friends said. 
In that same June essay about Hong Kong, Ms. Huang spoke critically about the way that a Chinese state news outlet had depicted the protesters as being backed by Western forces. The protesters have dismissed such claims and asserted that they alone are demanding greater police and official accountability and universal suffrage. 
“Perhaps, under the powerful apparatus of the party-state, ignorance and fear can be cultivated, information and news can be shielded, and reality and truth can be distorted,” Ms. Huang wrote. “But when you personally experience what happened — witness it — you can pretend to be ignorant no more.”

The New York Times,2019-09-07,Hong Kong Gears Up for Familiar Round of Weekend Protests,703 ,"
HONG KONG -- Tear gas, pepper spray and fire returned to the streets of Hong Kong on Friday, as police officers clashed with masked pro-democracy protesters in the first notable display of unrest since Hong Kong's top leader announced on Wednesday that she would withdraw a deeply unpopular extradition bill.
It was an early sign that the protests that have convulsed this city for three months are likely to continue. More protest actions are planned for this weekend, including an attempt to disrupt access to the airport on Saturday and a march on Sunday to the United States consulate to urge Congress to pass a bipartisan proposal to penalize officials who suppress freedoms in Hong Kong. 
  The protests were ignited in June by the contentious extradition bill, which would have exposed Hong Kongers to the mainland's opaque judiciary, but its withdrawal now seemed unlikely to fully placate the movement, which has since broadened far beyond that single issue to include calls for fundamental political reforms and an independent inquiry into police behavior. Other demands include amnesty for arrested protesters and the retraction of the label of some protesters as ''rioters.''
  On Friday evening, hundreds of black-clad protesters gathered in the Mong Kok neighborhood and some aimed laser pointers at police officers and set fires in the streets. Riot police sought to disperse the crowds by firing several rounds of tear gas, pepper spray and what appeared to be rubber bullets. Demonstrators, who have accused the company that manages Hong Kong's subway system of abetting police violence, also vandalized several metro stations.
  Elsewhere in the city, hundreds of protesters gathered in a mostly peaceful rally in the city's central business district chanting slogans like ''Reclaim Hong Kong, revolution of our times!'' and ''Five demands, not one less!''
  Public anger toward the police in particular has intensified in recent weeks after officers failed to stop a mob attack on protesters and bystanders at a train station. Police officers across the city are now routinely met with calls of ''mafia'' and ''corrupt cops.''
  On Friday, protesters gathered at Prince Edward station in Mong Kok demanding to see security footage from last weekend, when riot officers had charged into a waiting train car, beat four people with batons and doused them in pepper spray.
  Human rights groups have criticized the officers' actions, saying that the people were not offering resistance.
  When demonstrators showed up at Prince Edward Station on Friday evening, the authorities stopped train service, prompting protesters to break into the station. The damage they inflicted there and at Mong Kok and Yau Ma Tei stations led authorities to close the three subway stops by late Friday evening.
  The protests on Friday were an early test of public sentiment since Carrie Lam announced on Wednesday her four-point plan to ease the tensions that have plunged this former British colony into its worst crisis since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The protests have badly battered Hong Kong's economy, which sustained another blow on Friday when Fitch Ratings downgraded its credit rating for the region.
  In subsequent remarks on Thursday, Mrs. Lam urged peaceful demonstrators not to legitimize ''the really violent protesters,'' in what some saw as an attempt to sow divisions in the movement.
  But many moderate protesters have vowed to maintain a united front, saying that they would only be satisfied once all of the demonstrators' demands were met.
  On Friday evening in Chater Garden, about 1,000 peaceful protesters gathered at a rally where a large statue of a female protester had been erected in the square. The statue was clad in what has become the standard demonstration uniform -- hard hat, goggles, gas mask, backpack and umbrella.
  Charmaine Cheung, 30, who was among the moderate protesters gathered at the rally in Chater Garden, said the movement's aims have expanded well beyond the extradition bill. ''The problems that have since arisen are much more serious than whether the bill is withdrawn or not,'' said Ms. Cheung, a nurse.

As riot police tried storming a campus occupied by activists, they were met by protesters fighting back with Molotov cocktails and bows-and-arrows.
HONG KONG — Hundreds of Hong Kong activists armed with firebombs and bows-and-arrows on Monday battled riot police who have laid a days-long siege to a university, the most violent confrontation yet in . 
Early Monday, the police tried storming the campus at the main entrance and made some arrests. But the occupiers fought back with dozens of firebombs and set barricades ablaze, forcing the police to retreat.
As day broke, the occupiers and the police were still locked in the standoff  that began Saturday night, and smoke billowed from the grounds. Some protesters on Monday morning raced for the exits, only to be met with volleys of tear gas. 
The police , rubber bullets, water cannons and armored vehicles to try breach the barricades all day on Sunday. But activists resisted into the night. One police officer was hit in the leg by an arrow, while student leaders said protesters suffered eye injuries and hypothermia after being struck by the water cannon. 
The clashes were the culmination of  of the monthslong protests, a period that has focused a global spotlight on the growing desperation of the pro-democracy activists and aggressive efforts by the police to suppress them. It is a sign the conflict is turning more violent as the territory prepares to hold elections later this month.
The activists are struggling against the  to preserve            , a political system guaranteed for 50 years by an agreement between Beijing and London. The British handed over the global financial hub in 1997.

The university president, Jin-Guang Teng, said Monday morning that he had negotiated a temporary truce with the police, but suggested occupiers still would have to turn themselves in to the police after leaving the campus.
The clashes of the past week began when protesters changed from a regular routine of weekend protests to disrupting traffic on workdays. The disruptions and  — considered a last refuge by activists — quickly led to protesters occupying five universities, two of which sit astride key transportation routes.

Protesters abandoned four of the universities over the weekend, but . Hardcore activists converged there, while more moderate ones left on Sunday as the police surrounded the campus.
The police arrested dozens trying to flee, including first-aid volunteers. Mainstream supporters of the movement drove to the campus to try to get the police to back off. On Sunday night, the police threatened to use lethal force if the protesters did not leave.
“I know that there is a possibility that the police will fire live bullets on us tonight, but right now, we have no choice,” William Lau, 22, a protester on campus, said around midnight. He estimated there were about 500 activists on site at that time.
About 50 were arrested after trying to leave, he said, so others were wary of trying to exit.
“The police would never just let us walk out like that,” he said. “I know that some want to leave now but don’t know how, while a fair number want to stay and fight.”
Right outside the campus, pro-democracy lawmakers, a top Roman Catholic official, an American pastor and a student leader called on the Hong Kong government to intervene to prevent bloodshed.
“I want to seek help from the government to stop the police force from their operation and avoid tragedy,” said Owan Li, a student representative on the university council.
As the police fired tear gas, Bishop Joseph Ha tried entering with the lawmakers and the American pastor, William Devlin of the Bronx, but were turned away by the police.
“If the police are to launch a clearance, they should use as minimal force as possible because lives are precious,” Mr. Ha said. 
Mr. Devlin said in a telephone interview that he had been on campus for about four hours as the clashes unfolded and had left, but was trying to re-enter.
“They were not being deterred,” he said of the protesters. “They were ready to be arrested. They said, ‘We stand for freedom, dignity, democracy, human rights.’”
Mr. Devlin said he had been on the front line in the late afternoon Sunday when the police used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons against protesters.
He said he had seen protesters throw 10 to 20 firebombs to deter the police from advancing. At least two were armed with bows and arrows, he said.
Louis Lau, the police superintendent, said before midnight that an officer had fired a live round at a vehicle charging toward officers in an area near campus.
“Coldblooded rioters can only imitate terror acts,” he said. 
Protesters confronted the police throughout the night in nearby neighborhoods to try to draw them away from the campus. The presidents of five universities released a statement calling for restraint by all sides and asking everyone on the campus to leave.

The violence came after protesters at the university on Friday prepared for a long siege, as they poured gasoline into glass bottles to make hundreds or thousands of bombs and practiced throwing those into an empty swimming pool. They also did target practice with catapult-style slingshots and bows-and-arrows.
The police began advancing around 10 p.m. Saturday, and the clashes reached a high pitch on Sunday afternoon.
In nearby Kowloon Tong on Saturday, Chinese soldiers jogged out of their barracks by Hong Kong Baptist University and cleared bricks from streets that had been placed there by protesters to block traffic.
The soldiers wore T-shirts and basketball jerseys, and carried brooms. The  of the People’s Liberation Army is based in 19 sites once occupied by the British military. Even though Chinese troops have been stationed in Hong Kong since 1997, they almost never venture into the city.

The New York Times,2019-09-02,"Protesters Return to Hong Kong 's Airport, Disrupting Travel Plans",1371 ,"
HONG KONG -- Pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong began a new campaign on Sunday to squeeze access to the airport, hours after one of the most tumultuous days since protests in the city began in June.
Tens of thousands of people marched through parts of the city center on Saturday despite a ban on the protest by the police. Some protesters gathered around the local government's headquarters, where they threw bricks and firebombs as the police responded with tear gas, pepper spray and water cannons. 
  On Sunday, demonstrators began congregating at Hong Kong International Airport in a new effort to obstruct access to the critical Asian travel hub. The airport has been off limits to protesters since mid-August, when days of sit-ins led to assaults on two men from mainland China and hundreds of canceled flights.
  With classes set to begin on Monday for many Hong Kong students, schools could become the next front in the protest movement, which began over widespread anger over an extradition bill that would allow criminal suspects to be taken to mainland China. Since then, demonstrators' demands have grown to include a call for universal suffrage and an inquiry into accusations of police brutality.
  [How the protests in Hong Kong have evolved, with changing tactics and more violence.]
  Hundreds of protesters began to converge on the airport Sunday afternoon, traveling by bus, by car and on foot from a nearby subway station. A court injunction obtained after the airport protests last month allows only ticketed passengers and airport employees to enter the main terminals. But demonstrators gathered outside near the entrances, chanting, ''Fight for freedom! Stand with Hong Kong.'' Some used their cars to block lanes of traffic.
  ''We have been protesting and occupying for months,'' said Daniel Chan, 18, a college student who took a bus to the airport protest. ''Still, what we have done seems futile.''
  Mr. Chan said he did not intend to do anything illegal, but he was not concerned about the court injunction. ''There's almost nothing left for me to be scared of,'' he said. ''One document cannot deter me.''
  MTR, the Hong Kong subway operator, announced on Sunday afternoon that the Airport Express rail service between the airport and the city center was canceled, and trains to the city were later suspended after protesters threw debris on the tracks. Tung Chung Station, one of the subway stops closest to the airport, was also closed on Sunday evening because protesters had damaged the station, MTR said.
  [City on edge: Photographs from Hong Kong's summer of protest]
  The protests forced many travelers to find alternative routes to the airport. Nicole Zhao, 38, was one of many who had to wend, dodge and hopscotch their way through barriers that had been set up on the roads.
  Ms. Zhao, who is from mainland China and works in education, had just landed in Hong Kong from Beijing when she received a notice from the airline suggesting that she postpone her trip.
  ''What the protesters are doing is crazy,'' she said. ''This just shows how different the Hong Kong and mainland systems are.''
  Other travelers were more supportive of the protests.
  Eric Jabal, 47, an education consultant, walked with his roller suitcase and suit jacket on a debris-strewn road, dodging protesters and barricades. He said he had left his home at 12:30 p.m. for an 8:50 p.m. flight to Bangalore and had been walking for 25 minutes after he had been dropped off by an Uber.
  But Mr. Jabal, a Canadian who has been living in Hong Kong for 25 years, said he didn't mind the inconvenience.
  ''I'm really sad,'' he said. ''That the failure of leadership has led to such profound unrest among such a broad cross section of people -- it's clearly gone beyond the tipping point.''
  Students have been a major part of the protests all summer, and the beginning of classes on Monday raised questions about whether the start of school would mean a lessening of the movement or whether activism would shift to campuses.
  Students have planned two mass assemblies, one in the central business district in the morning and another after school at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Many high school students have also negotiated with school administrators to participate in sit-ins or to set aside classrooms for self-study sessions or silent protests on the first day of school.
  Education authorities said that students would need parent letters to skip class or to participate in strike activities.
  A top government official said on Sunday that the administration ''steadfastly opposed'' the planned class boycotts, calling them extremely irresponsible.
  ''Schools are places for learning, and are absolutely not places for expressing political views or demands,'' Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung wrote in a blog post.
  Earlier Sunday, the Hong Kong police said that they had arrested dozens of people in a subway station that was the scene of some of the most intense violence of the weekend, where officers used clubs and pepper spray on a group of protesters inside a train car.
  News footage and videos shared on social media showed members of the police Special Tactical Squad, in dark uniforms with their faces covered, charging into a waiting train car at Prince Edward Station and swinging batons at men and women who cowered on the floor, offering no resistance. After a fury of blows, one officer doused the group in pepper spray and then left.
  ''The police were out of control,'' said Crystal Yip, a 20-year-old college student who was in the station when officers arrived. ''They were crazy and they were mad. They were trying to express their anger by attacking people randomly.''
  Yolanda Yu, police senior superintendent, said 40 people were arrested in the station on suspicion of unlawful assembly, criminal damages and obstructing officers.
  ''Protesters used sticks and hard objects to attack police. We used the same level of force to respond to the situation,'' Ms. Yu said, replying to a reporter asking why the police had used pepper spray on commuters who were kneeling on the ground.
  She said that the police had warned civilians to stay away. ''Under chaotic situations, it is indeed hard to determine whether someone is a real journalist, a protester or a violent person,'' she said.
  The violence in Prince Edward Station began during a dispute between protesters and some older men who were insulting them. One of the men swung a hammer at the protesters, who threw water bottles and umbrellas and later appeared to set off fire extinguishers in the car. After the clashes, the subway system suspended service across much of Hong Kong. Three stations remained closed on Sunday.
  The subway operator, MTR, has been a target of vandalism since it began suspending service last month to stations in places near where protests are planned. It continued that pattern on Saturday, stopping service at Sai Ying Pun Station, near the Chinese government liaison office, a site of some protests.
  In the wake of the clashes, Chinese news outlets run by the Communist Party urged the Hong Kong government to take tough steps against the protesters and cited experts urging Carrie Lam, the chief executive of the city, to invoke emergency powers. An online outlet controlled by the Communist Party's law-and-order committee said the Hong Kong protesters were using ''terrorist methods.''
  ''The chaos in Hong Kong cannot go on!'' a front-page editorial in the overseas edition of People's Daily, the party's main newspaper, said on Sunday. ''At this crucial moment, the government of the special administrative region must have the courage and adeptness to apply every legal means to halt the violence and chaos, acting resolutely to detain and arrest violent lawbreakers, applying the law strictly to punish criminals, and swiftly restoring social order.''
  An online report from China's main television broadcaster, CCTV, said that Mrs. Lam should invoke emergency powers under a colonial-era ordinance to extinguish the violent protests. That step could empower the Hong Kong government to ban demonstrators from wearing masks, speed up arrests and censor ''harmful media,'' the report said."
The New York Times ,2019-09-04,"Hong Kong _s Leader, Carrie Lam, to Withdraw Extradition Bill That Ignited Protests",1663 ,"
HONG KONG — Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said Wednesday that the government would withdraw a contentious extradition bill that ignited months of protests in the city, moving to quell the worst political crisis since the former British colony returned to Chinese control 22 years ago.
The move responds to a major demand of the protesters, who feared China would exploit the measure to extradite suspects for prosecution in China’s opaque judicial system. But it was unclear if the concession would be enough to bring an end to intensifying demonstrations, which are now driven by multiple grievances with the government.
“Incidents over these past two months have shocked and saddened Hong Kong people,” she said in an eight-minute televised statement broadcast shortly before 6 p.m. “We are all very anxious about Hong Kong, our home. We all hope to find a way out of the current impasse and unsettling times.”
Her decision, which was met with skepticism by some pro-democracy figures in Hong Kong, comes as the protests near their three-month mark and show little sign of abating, roiling a city known for its orderliness and hurting its economy.
It also came as something of a surprise: Just a day before, China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office had signaled an uncompromising stance toward the protests. Yang Guang, a spokesman for the office, said at a briefing in Beijing that there could be “no middle ground, no hesitance and no dithering, when it comes to stopping the violence and controlling riots in Hong Kong.”
A possible hint of a change in Beijing’s stand, however, came from the country’s leader, Xi Jinping. In a speech on Tuesday to the Party School of the Communist Party’s Central Committee, Mr. Xi called on rising party officials to show resolve for a long struggle but suggested that the leadership could adjust its tactics to achieve its aims.
“On matters of principle, not an inch will be yielded,” Mr. Xi said, “but on matters of tactics there can be flexibility.”
, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University and the author of “China Tomorrow: Democracy or Dictatorship?” suggested on Wednesday evening that Beijing had asked Mrs. Lam to make the decision as a tactical calculation ahead of the Oct. 1 anniversary of the establishment of the People’s Republic of China.
The aim, he said, was “to calm down the movement’s moderates” and “weaken and isolate the radicals.”
“Maybe it is a good calculation on the part of Beijing,” he added, “but it may also fail.”
By early Thursday, the Chinese government had not made any public comment on Mrs. Lam’s announcement, and state-run Chinese media gave her withdrawal of the extradition bill relatively brief, muted coverage. Absent was any of the fiery commentary that has dominated mainland Chinese reporting of Hong Kong’s turmoil, suggesting that Communist Party officials may still be working out a reaction designed to counter accusations of retreat.
Mrs. Lam had  and later             but demonstrators have long been suspicious of her government’s refusal to formally withdraw the bill and feared that it could be revived at a later date.
Withdrawal of the bill has remained at the top of the list of protesters’ demands. But the list has grown to include an independent investigation into the police response, amnesty for arrested protesters and direct elections for all lawmakers and the chief executive.
[           ]
Michael Tien, a moderate pro-Beijing lawmaker, said withdrawal alone might have been enough to calm the protests in mid-June. But since then, “with the accumulation of so much resentment, so many accusations and so many disputes,” the establishment of an independent inquiry “is 100 percent necessary,” Mr. Tien said.
At least some of the hard-line, pro-Beijing camp in Hong Kong expressed skepticism on Wednesday evening about Mrs. Lam’s overture, seeing it not as a clever gambit to ease pressure but rather as a sign of political weakness that would only encourage further protests.
One hard-liner, who insisted on anonymity because of political sensitivities, said that the initial hostility to the overture from democracy advocates showed that the hard-liners’ worries about concessions were being vindicated.
Mrs. Lam described the withdrawal as a step to initiate dialogue. She also said she would add two members to an existing police review board, but that step was far short of calls for an independent investigation.
Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker, described Mrs. Lam’s announcement as a “political performance.”
“That it took her three months to formally use the word ‘withdraw’ is truly too little, too late,” Ms. Mo told reporters. “A big mistake has been made.”
This summer has seen peaceful marches involving hundreds of thousands of people, as well as street protests by smaller groups who have become increasingly violent in recent weeks, throwing bricks and firebombs at the police. More than 1,100 people have been arrested since early June. The police, who have used batons, rubber bullets and tear gas against protesters, have faced allegations of excessive force.
Months of protests have started to ripple through the economy, hurting some small businesses and the tourism industry. Many economists believe the city’s economy is now slipping into recession.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index closed up 3.9 percent on Wednesday as the prospect of Mrs. Lam’s news conference began circulating. Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based airline that has faced criticism from the Chinese government for its employees’ participation in the protests, climbed more than 7 percent. After the market closed, the  of its chairman.
Withdrawal of the extradition bill was the initial demand of protesters, and the rallying cry when, by organizers’ estimates,  on June 9 and            , more than one in every four people in Hong Kong.
Withdrawal of the bill “will help to an insignificant extent,” said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s Center for China Studies.
The concession “might pacify a small sector of the population but it will not have any impact on whether the waves of protests would subside,” he added.
On LIHKG, an online forum popular with protesters, several posts on Wednesday repeated longstanding calls not to compromise until all demands are met. The Civil Human Right Front, which has organized huge protest marches against the bill, said it would also continue its campaign until the protesters’ calls were satisfied.
Full withdrawal of the extradition bill has long been seen as the easiest compromise that the government could make. But mainland Chinese officials had objected to that possibility, saying that doing so would suggest that the original intentions behind the legislation were mistaken.
Chinese officials had also said that any independent inquiry into the police’s conduct and other aspects of the unrest could not be started until the protests died down.
Over weeks of protests, state news outlets and other commentators on the mainland unleashed scathing criticism of the protesters, portraying them as rioters and, in some cases, suggesting they were traitors or terrorists. One analyst said Beijing may have been motivated to allow a concession in order to begin reining in the nationalistic rhetoric to some degree.
“Beijing loves the nationalistic sentiment, but only to the point that it’s controllable,” said Samson Yuen, an assistant professor of political science at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. “At some point Beijing wants to rein that in for fear that these nationalistic sentiments will point toward the government.”
As the protests dragged on, pro-Beijing lawmakers had expressed concern that the anger at the government would hurt their camp in district council elections in November and legislative elections next year.
Saturday, the fifth anniversary of a decision by China’s legislature to put limits on direct elections in Hong Kong,  since the protests began. After a march by tens of thousands, some protesters gathered around the main government offices, hurling rocks and firebombs. Riot police officers fired tear gas and pumped blue-dyed water from trucks at protesters.
Protesters built barricades and set fires, and the police later pursued them across several neighborhoods, arresting dozens. In a subway station in the Prince Edward neighborhood, officers from the police’s Special Tactical Squad entered a stopped train, using batons to hit people who were crouching on the floor and dousing them with pepper spray.
The Chinese government was initially silent on this summer’s protests, then began to condemn them in increasingly strident tones, warning that the military could be called in. Images of Chinese police officers and paramilitary troops conducting anti-riot drills in Shenzhen, a mainland city near Hong Kong, were given regular coverage by state media outlets.

The New York Times,2019-07-29,"Hong Kong Protesters, Ignoring Calls to Stand Down, Flood Downtown",1268 ,"
HONG KONG -- For the second day in a row, thousands rallied on Sunday in Hong Kong to protest mob violence and what they say is police brutality against peaceful marchers. And for the second consecutive day, the police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the throngs.
On Saturday, riot police officers unleashed pepper spray and rubber bullets and clashed briefly with demonstrators in a train station in a northern town. Barely 24 hours later, clashes erupted again that turned parts of downtown Hong Kong into a tear gas-filled battlefield as riot officers beat back demonstrators who tried to approach the Chinese government's representative office in the territory. 
  The police on Sunday fired dozens of rounds of tear gas starting from about 7 p.m. and charged protesters, sending hundreds of bystanders who were watching nearby scrambling for shelter. Groups of riot officers with clubs chased black-clad protesters down alleys in the dense urban district.
  In some areas, as the police sought to disperse the demonstrators, they beat them with batons and shields, pressed them to the ground and cuffed them. Some protesters appeared injured. The police said protesters had thrown bricks and other hard objects as they charged police lines.
  ''I am really shocked,'' said Isaac Chan, a lawyer who lives near the liaison office, saying he was upset about the police response and the use of tear gas.
  Mr. Chan, 36, said he supported the protesters but had not participated in any demonstrations. ''It is complete violence by the police,'' he said. ''Ridiculous.''
  This was the third straight weekend that violent clashes had broken out since the demonstrations began nearly two months ago over an unpopular bill, since shelved, that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Since then, the demonstrations have grown into almost daily public displays of vitriol against the police, Hong Kong's leaders and the government in Beijing, throwing Hong Kong into its worst political crisis since it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
  The chaos on Sunday unfolded across several districts, moving from the Police Headquarters to a major shopping area and then near the central government's offices in the west. Many shops locked their doors early and rolled down steel barriers. Streets were emptied after the police pushed back protesters, and cars slowly navigated around protester barriers left in the roads. Tourists and residents turned onto streets filled with tear gas, only to retreat coughing and with eyes burning.
  The police, armed with full-length shields, helmets, batons and gas masks and backed by lines of police vans with sirens blaring, formed tight rows several yards across from the protesters, who wore helmets and gas masks and formed their own line with makeshift shields fashioned from street signs they had ripped off, umbrellas and trash bins. The police sent out advisories warning residents living in affected neighborhoods to keep their windows shut because tear gas would be deployed.
  Hong Kong's embattled leader, Carrie Lam, has come under pressure from Beijing to restore order in the territory. In addition to the full withdrawal of the extradition bill, protesters have demanded an expansion of direct elections and an independent investigation into police use of force.
  Mrs. Lam, who suspended the extradition bill, has refused to make any further concessions to the protesters and appears confident her administration can wait out the protest movement despite the escalating violence.
  [Here's what protesters and government supporters have to say.]
  The authorities had banned marches in the city this weekend, citing concerns of violence, but that did not stop protesters from turning out on Saturday in Yuen Long, a satellite town where a mob had attacked demonstrators a week earlier. The protesters on Sunday also ignored a police ban against marching to the western part of Hong Kong Island.
  The last stop of the banned march on Sunday was supposed to be close to the central government's representative office. As a symbol of Communist Party rule, the office has for years been a target of the pro-democracy movement that has sought to fight what it denounces as the erosion of freedoms that set Hong Kong apart from the rest of China.
  But on Sunday, after gathering downtown, thousands of protesters unexpectedly started marching in the opposite direction of the liaison office. No police officers were seen until the crowd reached Police Headquarters, where a handful of officers appeared behind barriers as hundreds of protesters shouted slogans outside.
  The protesters filled Hennessy Road, the center of a major shopping district in the Causeway Bay district, and began building barriers from sidewalk railings.
  Hundreds more headed toward the liaison office about three miles away, where they faced off against riot police defending the building, and threw things at the officers. The officers fired tear gas and shouted warnings that the protesters were participating in an illegal gathering.
  The police said that some protesters had set ablaze a cart and pushed it toward a police cordon. ''Police condemn the protesters' escalating violence and appeal to everyone at scene to stay calm,'' the government said in a statement.
  The police said early Monday that 49 people had been arrested on charges including unauthorized assembly and possession of an offensive weapon.
  Before the protest on Sunday, workers had erected barriers around the liaison office and glued down nearby pavement stones to prevent them from being dug up and hurled by demonstrators.
  Protesters had defaced the liaison office a week ago, painting slogans and throwing eggs and ink at a crest of the Chinese state. That vandalism set off days of vociferous denunciations from Chinese officials.
  A statement from the authorities in Beijing said the actions ''openly challenged the authority of the central government.'' On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of National Defense cited the damage to the liaison office when he warned that the military could be called upon to quell unrest in Hong Kong.
  In recent days, protesters have also been angered by reports that one of the central government office's district staffers had given a speech in Yuen Long urging residents to drive out demonstrators.
  Last weekend, a group of men, including some accused of having connections with the gangs known as triads, assaulted protesters and others in a Yuen Long train station. At least 45 people were injured.

The New York Times ,2019-07-28,Hong Kong Protest_ Clashes With Police Turn Downtown Into Tear Gas-Filled Battlefield,1387 ,"
HONG KONG — For the second day in a row, thousands rallied on Sunday in Hong Kong to protest mob violence and what they say is police brutality against peaceful marchers. And for the second consecutive day, the police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the throngs.
On Saturday, riot police officers unleashed pepper spray and rubber bullets and clashed briefly with demonstrators in a train station in a northern town. Barely 24 hours later, clashes erupted again that turned parts of downtown Hong Kong into a tear gas-filled battlefield as riot officers beat back demonstrators who tried to approach the Chinese government’s representative office in the territory.
The police on Sunday fired dozens of rounds of tear gas starting from about 7 p.m. and charged protesters, sending hundreds of bystanders who were watching nearby scrambling for shelter. Groups of riot officers with clubs chased black-clad protesters down alleys in the dense urban district.
In some areas, as the police sought to disperse the demonstrators, they beat them with batons and shields, pressed them to the ground and cuffed them. Some protesters appeared injured. The police said protesters had thrown bricks and other hard objects as they charged police lines.
“I am really shocked,” said Isaac Chan, a lawyer who lives near the liaison office, saying he was upset about the police response and the use of tear gas.
Mr. Chan, 36, said he supported the protesters but had not participated in any demonstrations. “It is complete violence by the police,” he said. “Ridiculous.”
This was the third straight weekend that violent clashes had broken out since the demonstrations began nearly two months ago over , that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Since then, the demonstrations have grown into almost daily public displays of vitriol against the police, Hong Kong’s leaders and the government in Beijing, throwing Hong Kong into its worst political crisis since it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
The chaos on Sunday unfolded across several districts, moving from the Police Headquarters to a major shopping area and then near the central government’s offices in the west. Many shops locked their doors early and rolled down steel barriers. Streets were emptied after the police pushed back protesters, and cars slowly navigated around protester barriers left in the roads. Tourists and residents turned onto streets filled with tear gas, only to retreat coughing and with eyes burning.
The police, armed with full-length shields, helmets, batons and gas masks and backed by lines of police vans with sirens blaring, formed tight rows several yards across from the protesters, who wore helmets and gas masks and formed their own line with makeshift shields fashioned from street signs they had ripped off, umbrellas and trash bins. The police sent out advisories warning residents living in affected neighborhoods to keep their windows shut because tear gas would be deployed.
, has come under pressure from Beijing to restore order in the territory. In addition to the full withdrawal of the extradition bill, protesters have demanded an expansion of direct elections and an independent investigation into police use of force.
Mrs. Lam, who suspended the extradition bill, has refused to make any further concessions to the protesters and appears confident her administration can wait out the protest movement despite the escalating violence.
[Here’s what .]
The authorities had banned marches in the city this weekend, citing concerns of violence, but that  from turning out on Saturday in Yuen Long, a satellite town where a mob had attacked demonstrators a week earlier. The protesters on Sunday also ignored a police ban against marching to the western part of Hong Kong Island.
The last stop of the banned march on Sunday was supposed to be close to the central government’s representative office. As a symbol of Communist Party rule, the office has for years been a target of the pro-democracy movement that has sought to fight what it denounces as the erosion of freedoms that set Hong Kong apart from the rest of China.
But on Sunday, after gathering downtown, thousands of protesters unexpectedly started marching in the opposite direction of the liaison office. No police officers were seen until the crowd reached Police Headquarters, where a handful of officers appeared behind barriers as hundreds of protesters shouted slogans outside.
The protesters filled Hennessy Road, the center of a major shopping district in the Causeway Bay district, and began building barriers from sidewalk railings.
Hundreds more headed toward the liaison office about three miles away, where they faced off against riot police defending the building, and threw things at the officers. The officers fired tear gas and shouted warnings that the protesters were participating in an illegal gathering.
The police said that some protesters had set ablaze a cart and pushed it toward a police cordon. “Police condemn the protesters’ escalating violence and appeal to everyone at scene to stay calm,” the government said in a statement.
The police said early Monday that 49 people had been arrested on charges including unauthorized assembly and possession of an offensive weapon.
Before the protest on Sunday, workers had erected barriers around the liaison office and glued down nearby pavement stones to prevent them from being dug up and hurled by demonstrators.
Protesters had defaced the liaison office a week ago, painting slogans and throwing eggs and ink at a crest of the Chinese state. That vandalism set off days of vociferous denunciations from Chinese officials.
A statement from the authorities in Beijing said the actions “openly challenged the authority of the central government.” On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of National Defense cited the damage to the liaison office when he .
In recent days, protesters have also been angered by reports that one of the central government office’s district staffers had given a speech in Yuen Long urging residents to drive out demonstrators.
Last weekend, a group of men, including some accused of having connections with , assaulted protesters and others in a Yuen Long train station.            
The liaison office has dismissed alleged links to the Yuen Long violence as “malicious rumors.” But it is facing increasing scrutiny over its role in Hong Kong, which is a semiautonomous part of China that has operated under a model of “one country, two systems” since its 1997 return from British control.

HONG KONG — Thousands of antigovernment demonstrators in Hong Kong dodged police tear gas and occupied a major shopping district and other central areas on Sunday, in the second of three straight days of large-scale civil disobedience.
The flash mob-style maneuvers came a day after , resulting in more than 20 arrests, and a day before a planned citywide strike that may significantly disrupt daily life in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese region.
The long weekend of civil unrest — in which thousands of black-clad protesters have deliberately kept the authorities guessing their next move — may place a new level of pressure on Hong Kong’s deeply unpopular government to meet the protest movement’s broad range of demands.
Those demands include an independent inquiry into  and the complete withdrawal of suspended legislation that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party.
“Protests have been happening in multiple districts at the same time rather than one concentrated area, which is rather unprecedented,” Samson Yuen, an expert on social movements at Lingnan University in Hong Kong, said of the weekend protests. “As protests move toward residential areas, anger and momentum has been building towards the general strike on Monday.”
The strike and other events in the largely leaderless protest movement have been organized informally through social messaging apps like Telegram. Mr. Yuen said the strike, which has been endorsed by major trade unions and could include traffic disruptions throughout the city, would probably have a much greater impact than one that was attempted last month.
“If a general strike does happen tomorrow, it means it can happen again,” Mr. Yuen said.
On Sunday, the Hong Kong government  not to participate in strikes the next day by disrupting traffic and blocking roads, saying such acts would push the region into a “very dangerous situation.”
The mostly peaceful protests this summer, which began nearly two months ago, have thrown Hong Kong into its worst political crisis since Britain handed control to China in 1997. The Hong Kong government and police force are under pressure from Beijing to restore order as the protests become more unruly and as demonstrators increasingly direct their ire at mainland rule.
The local news media reported that objects hurled at police officers during street clashes on Saturday night included at least two gasoline bombs, a possible sign of an escalation in protest tactics.
Last week, the commander of the  warned that violent protests that challenged China’s political system were “absolutely intolerable.” But the prospect of a Chinese military intervention in Hong Kong still appears remote, even as the embattled Hong Kong police struggle to maintain public order.
The protest on Sunday began with a police-approved march in Tseung Kwan O, a quiet residential district in eastern Hong Kong that lies across the harbor from the city’s main island.
In a light drizzle, a crowd of protesters of all ages wove through the streets as curious residents opened their high-rise windows to watch.
“Monday, we strike!” the protesters chanted.
Lee Lai-ping, 67, who lives in Tseung Kwan O and attended the march, said it was only the second time this summer that she had come out to protest. She said she had been motivated to attend after watching television footage of riot police officers clashing in the small hours of Sunday morning with older residents of Wong Tai Sin, a working-class Hong Kong neighborhood.
“I have grandchildren already, and they are still very young,” she added. “I don’t want them to grow up in a city run by Communists and the police.”
Some protesters vandalized the Tseung Kwan O police station with eggs and spray paint, and broke many of its windows by throwing bricks.
By early evening, many protesters had joined an unauthorized march from a western area of Hong Kong’s main island toward Sheung Wan, a dense neighborhood in the heart of the city’s central business district.
The route of the unauthorized march was set to pass by the Chinese government liaison office, a building that protesters defaced two weeks ago with eggs and graffiti, .
But shortly after 7 p.m. — before protesters could reach the liaison office — riot police officers began to clear the streets by firing tear gas. The police force had accused them of “.”
By 8 p.m., the protesters had largely moved to the Causeway Bay district, farther east on the island, using makeshift barricades to block off a major shopping district there that includes luxury boutiques and an Apple store.
Other protesters briefly blocked the Hong Kong Island side of a nearby tunnel that passes under the city’s harbor, and which had been blocked by protesters a night earlier from the opposite side.
Some began marching west, toward a square on the island’s waterfront whose main attraction is a golden statue of a bauhinia flower, an emblem of the city. They spray painted the statue with the words “liberate Hong Kong,” one of many .
The square is the place where, in a 2017 speech marking the 20th anniversary of the former British colony’s handover to Chinese control, President Xi Jinping of China warned Hong Kong residents .
Shortly before 10 p.m. on Sunday, riot police officers descended on Causeway Bay and fired multiple rounds of tear gas. The force said on Twitter that it took the measure only after issuing “” for protesters to stop occupying roads and damaging property.
Many protesters then fled north by public transport across the harbor to various parts of Kowloon, where they were expected to continue occupying roads and antagonizing the police into the small hours, as they had done the night before.
Demonstrators on Sunday said their aim was to move quickly from one target to the next to minimize the number of people who would be at risk of arrest.
“We are not as well equipped as the police, so we have to be as fluid as possible,” said one protester, Jason Law, a 19-year-old student.
The protest movement began in early June because of opposition to the contentious extradition bill, which has since  by the territory’s unpopular leader, Carrie Lam. But she has refused to formally withdraw it as protesters have demanded, stoking further public discontent.
The protesters are also seeking Mrs. Lam’s resignation, direct elections, the retraction of the government’s characterization of a  as a riot and the unconditional release of all protesters who have been arrested since early June. But for now, it seems unlikely that Mrs. Lam’s pro-Beijing government or its backers in the Chinese mainland will make further concessions.
After Saturday night’s unrest, the police  on suspicion of a range of offenses, including assault and unlawful assembly. That came days after             were arrested following earlier clashes.
Demonstrations on Saturday began as an approved protest but devolved into an occupation of a major shopping district on Kowloon. Some protesters attacked a nearby police station with bricks and paint-filled bottles.
At one point on Saturday afternoon, protesters removed a Chinese flag from a pole and tossed it into the harbor.
In a statement the next day, the mainland government agency responsible for Hong Kong affairs said that action “must be severely punished in accordance with the law, and not softly.”

Demonstrations this week over a proposed law that would allow extraditions to mainland China have produced some of the city’s biggest shows of dissent in years.
HONG KONG — Protesters in Hong Kong, fearful that their civil liberties are under threat, are gathering in numbers not seen for years in this semiautonomous Chinese territory.
They are protesting a proposed law that would allow criminal suspects to be sent to jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has no extradition agreement, including mainland China, where the legal system is controlled by the ruling Communist Party. Critics of the law worry that it could be used to detain or intimidate activists, journalists and others who run afoul of Beijing.
[Why are people protesting in Hong Kong? ]
A protest on Sunday , organizers said, in a city of about seven million. The Hong Kong government, which is dominated by pro-Beijing lawmakers, said on Monday that the bill            . In response, opponents of the law gathered outside the Hong Kong legislature starting Tuesday night,             on the bill that was scheduled for Wednesday.
The protests intensified on Wednesday afternoon, with protesters hurling bricks, bottles and umbrellas as they clashed with the police. Riot police officers responded by deploying tear gas against protesters who tried unsuccessfully to storm the Legislative Council.
[ on the protests.]
The protests in Hong Kong, a former British colony that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, have been compared to a pro-democracy sit-in in 2014 that shut down major roadways for almost three months but failed to win any government concessions. On Wednesday, the protesters were blocking some of the same roads.
Here are photographs from the protests this week.
Wednesday
Tuesday
Protesters started arriving outside the Hong Kong government complex on Tuesday night in preparation for protests on Wednesday aimed at disrupting a scheduled debate on the bill. 
Earlier on Tuesday, Andrew Leung, the president of the Legislative Council, had said that despite mass protests, lawmakers were likely to vote on the bill by the end of next week, a faster timetable than had been expected. The Hong Kong government says the measure is important to prevent the city from becoming a haven for fugitives. It is likely to pass the legislature, where pro-Beijing lawmakers hold 43 of 70 seats.
Sunday
The protest on Sunday was the largest in Hong Kong’s recent history, drawing hundreds of thousands of people on a sweltering afternoon.
Though the demonstration was largely peaceful, after midnight riot police officers removed a few hundred protesters who tried to occupy an area outside the Legislative Council after government officials said that debate on the bill would proceed as scheduled on Wednesday. Some protesters and police officers were injured.
When China resumed governance of Hong Kong in 1997, it promised the city a “high degree of autonomy.” But many residents feel that Hong Kong’s civil liberties are steadily being worn down under Beijing’s rule, and that the extradition law would make the situation worse.
“This law is dangerous, and not just for activists,” said one man who was there with his wife. “We are not activists. Even as regular citizens, we can’t stand to see China eroding away our freedom.”

The New York Times,2019-10-02,"On Chinese Holiday, Violence Offsets Pageantry",1647 ,"
BEIJING -- China's authoritarian president used the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule on Tuesday to pledge that nothing would stop his nation's ascent. But the message was marred by some of the worst anti-government violence to convulse Hong Kong, including the first police shooting of a protester.
Anticipation of a confrontation in Hong Kong on the anniversary, which Chinese leaders in Beijing consider a sacrosanct event, had been building since the protests began this summer in the semiautonomous territory bordering southern China. It intensified in recent weeks as a combative core of protesters confronted police officers who have relied more heavily on force. 
  The split-screen contrast of tightly choreographed goose-stepping military formations in Beijing to celebrate the National Day versus the chaos of firebombs and rubber bullets in Hong Kong was jarring, and almost certainly infuriating to President Xi Jinping.
  It laid bare how Mr. Xi's image and agenda have become hostage to the months of protests, undermining his reputation for unshakable control.
  As the festivities in Beijing got underway, Mr. Xi offered his government as a guarantor of ''prosperity and stability'' in Hong Kong. But after the parade ended, protesters in Hong Kong directly challenged China's hold over the city, clashing with the police in multiple neighborhoods that turned vast swathes of the territory into a tear gas-choked and bonfire-filled battlefield.
  ''I think they've succeeded in spoiling the show,'' said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University who specializes in Chinese politics. ''The media will be split between covering the parade in Beijing and covering what's happening in Hong Kong.''
  For Mr. Xi, every element of the military parade and civilian march marking 70 years since Mao founded the People's Republic was designed and meticulously rehearsed to show that his authoritarian policies were transforming China into a wealthy, militarily formidable and socially united superpower.
  He presided over an 80-minute parade by China's military that included the first public showing of a missile that can carry 10 nuclear warheads and hit anywhere in the United States. A civilian march displayed the country's economic and technological accomplishments, including its homegrown C919 jetliner, its Jade Rabbit moon rover and a Long March space rocket.
  ''No force can shake the status of our great motherland,'' Mr. Xi said, overlooking Tiananmen Square. ''No force can obstruct the advance of the Chinese people and Chinese nation.''
  While this year's parade, as previous ones, was intended to strut the country's military might, it also reflected a modernization program that Mr. Xi has pushed through the People's Liberation Army.
  Several new weapons made their first public appearances, including supersonic and stealth drones and an unmanned underwater vehicle. So did the country's newest intercontinental ballistic missile, called the DF-41, that can deliver multiple nuclear warheads around the world.
  ''I've heard what President Xi has said about focusing on peace but I am also sure that China will not display weakness,'' Gao Yuan, 23, a worker in Beijing's high-tech district, said after watching the parade, one of an estimated 120 million who did so, according to state media. ''We are very powerful -- just look at our tanks and planes and you can see how very strong our country is.''
  All the displays of China's economic and military strength, however, seems unable to silence those in Hong Kong who oppose Mr. Xi's increasingly intolerant ideological rule over China.
  In his speech marking the national anniversary, Mr. Xi promised to keep Hong Kong under the ''one country, two systems'' framework, designed to give it considerable legal and political autonomy after the British left in 1997. But critics say Mr. Xi has hijacked it to increase Chinese leverage over the city.
  The protests started in June over a proposed law that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the party controls the courts. They quickly evolved into calls for police accountability and broader democratic reforms by protesters, who felt the Hong Kong political establishment had been overly beholden to Beijing and allowed it to erode their freedoms.
  In Hong Kong, the protesters seized on China's long-planned 70th anniversary celebrations as a moment to humble Mr. Xi. Tens of thousands marched through a busy shopping district in the afternoon despite a police ban. Chants of a popular protest slogan, ''Reclaim Hong Kong; revolution of our times,'' echoed off a canyon of skyscrapers and shuttered malls.
  ''I couldn't just sit home today,'' said Stanley Luk, 65, who owns a handbag factory on the mainland but joined the protest march. ''There's not much we can do. But at least we can tell Beijing no, we don't want to live the way they do.''
  Clashes quickly broke out in other areas where hundreds of black-clad protesters fought with riot police officers, lobbing firebombs, setting piles of trash on fire and attacking the premises of private businesses they deemed as sympathetic to Beijing.
  When the protesters refused to retreat, the police fired bullets, mostly into the air.
  But in the Tsuen Wan neighborhood, near Hong Kong's border with the Chinese mainland, a police officer shot an 18-year-old in the left shoulder during a melee.
  Video footage showed that before the shooting, a protester had been among a large group of people who tackled a police officer to the ground and beat him with what looked like metal pipes. That protester then turned to a second police officer, who was backed against a shuttered storefront with his gun drawn. The officer fired at close range, after the protester appeared to have hit him.
  The shooting was likely to further inflame tensions in the territory. The protesters had already been enraged by what they see as police brutality over the summer, while supporters of the police have felt that the demonstrators have excessively tested the tolerance limits of the force.
  Natalie Chan, a university student who was protesting on Tuesday night in the Tuen Mun district, not far from Tsuen Wan, said that the Hong Kong police were ''hurting innocent people.''
  ''We can't let them continue,'' Ms. Chan said of the police, as nearby protesters smashed traffic lights and the windows of shops and restaurants.
  Mr. Xi has never mentioned the tumult in the territory. And for months, he seemed to have decided to leave it to the Hong Kong authorities to handle.
  The question now, with the holiday having passed, is whether Mr. Xi's calculus will change. China is already facing myriad challenges -- from the trade war with the United States to economic pressures that are slowing growth to the lowest level in years -- that could make the authorities in Beijing lose patience with the defiance in Hong Kong.
  Hong Kong's embattled chief executive, Carrie Lam, attended the parade, seated on the rostrum of the Tiananmen Gate with Mr. Xi, and former leaders, the members of the Communist Party's Standing Committee and other provincial leaders. Her critics in Hong Kong derided her smiling presence in Beijing as that of a supplicant, not an autonomous leader, which illustrated the depth of the chasm between the two sides.
  As evening fell and Beijing prepared for celebratory fireworks, Hong Kong had descended into some of the most intense clashes seen since the protests began almost four months ago.
  The protests paralyzed large areas of the territory as major thoroughfares were blocked in tense standoffs between demonstrators and the police. Subway stations, libraries, shopping malls and storefronts were shut in nine districts where the protests erupted.
  Sirens of ambulances and fire trucks wailed as the police chased and accosted the protesters. Some demonstrators burned Chinese flags and photographs of Mr. Xi. The police said some protesters attacked officers with a ''corrosive fluid,'' causing chemical burns, and threw gasoline bombs into a train compartment and onto a subway station platform.
  In the end, more than 180 people were arrested, 25 officers were injured and 74 people were hospitalized including two in critical condition, the authorities said.
  The Hong Kong police commissioner, Stephen Lo, told reporters at a midnight news conference that doctors were treating the 18-year-old who had been shot. Mr. Lo said the authorities would decide later whether to press charges against him for assaulting a police officer.
  Mr. Lo also said the police officer who fired had acted in a ''legal and reasonable'' manner by giving a verbal warning beforehand, and that the officer had been forced to shoot after being assaulted at close quarters.
  ''The range was not determined by the police officer, but by the perpetrator,'' he said.
  But some Hong Kongers felt that the authorities were to blame for allowing the day to spiral into chaos.
  In Wong Tai Sin, where the police fired tear gas near a retirement home, dozens of residents without masks or protest gear shouted at officers to retreat. Some mocked the city's leader, Mrs. Lam, for having left town.
  ''I want to cry. I come downstairs and feel that I have walked into a war zone,'' said Vincey Wu, a 53-year-old accountant. ''Carrie Lam has gone off to celebrate National Day. But has she thought about her people who are breathing in tear gas?''Chris Buckley and Steven Lee Myers reported from Beijing, and Mike Ives from Hong Kong.

The New York Times,2019-11-01,When a Hong Kong Protest Ends,975 ,"
A photographer returned to the sites of protests he documented in recent months. His diptychs show how life returns to normal, even if briefly, as the antigovernment movement continues.
On a sweltering afternoon in August, antigovernment protesters in gas masks and hard hats flooded a six-lane road, prompting riot police officers to fire tear gas. But life on that Hong Kong street continued after the clashes faded, even as the neighborhood became the focus of further unrest.  
  Such contrasts have been common in Hong Kong since June, when large-scale protests set off the former British colony's worst political crisis in decades. 
  The ongoing demonstrations play out with a familiar cadence nearly every weekend: marches marred by violent moments between protesters and the police. Then the action is done, replaced by the usual rhythms of the neighborhoods until the chaos comes back.
  To show that dissonance, the photographer Lam Yik Fei returned this month to streets where he had documented mass rallies and street clashes in recent months -- capturing moments from the exact same vantage points. His diptychs illustrate the jarring contrasts that residents of the Chinese territory now regularly experience.
  First major protest
  Hundreds of thousands marched through some of Hong Kong's main commercial districts like Wan Chai to express anger over contentious legislation, since scrapped, that would have allowed extraditions to the Chinese mainland. The demonstration on June 9 was effectively the start of this year's protest movement, and among the largest demonstrations in the city's history. Most days the neighborhood is a center of shopping and night life. 
  Storming the legislature
  When hundreds of thousands marched on the anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China in 1997 on July 1, a smaller group of activists broke into the local legislature, smashing glass walls and spray-painting slogans in its inner chamber.
  On Oct. 16, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's embattled chief executive, tried to deliver her annual policy address in the inner chamber. But pro-democracy lawmakers heckled her out of the room.
  Chaos in a mall
  A peaceful rally on July 14 descended into clashes with the police at a shopping mall in northern Hong Kong. There have since been other sit-ins and protests at the same mall, including one in September in which protesters stomped on a Chinese flag and sprayed it with black paint. 
  But the mall has mostly stayed open, even as tourism and shopping has fallen amid the protests in Hong Kong that now roil the city most weekends.
   Attack by a mob
  A mob of men in white T-shirts with sticks and metal bars on July 22 assaulted dozens of people, including journalists and a pro-democracy lawmaker, at a train station in Yuen Long, a district near Hong Kong's border with mainland China. The attack raised questions about why nearby police officers, shown talking to the men that night in a park near the station, did not protect the victims. 
  Yuen Long clashes
  Five days after the Yuen Long assaults, tens of thousands of protesters converged on the district. Riot police officers, some of whom are pictured, fired multiple rounds of tear gas to disperse the crowds. As sunset approached months later, a calm pervaded the working-class neighborhood. 
  Tension at a bus stop
  A police officer on July 30 aimed a shotgun at protesters during a clash in the Kwai Chung district, where residents usually catch the bus. The Hong Kong Police Force later said the weapon had been loaded with beanbag rounds, and that the officer drew it only after protesters attacked him.
  The protest movement portrayed the officer, Sgt. Lau Chak-kei, as a villain. On the Chinese mainland, they called him a hero, and the central government invited him to a military parade in Beijing on China's National Day.
  Disrupting the subway
  Protesters accuse Hong Kong's subway operator, the MTR Corporation, of being too close to the local government and police force. Sometimes they express their anger by blocking trains from running, as they did during a citywide general strike on Aug. 5. Despite the disruptions, the system still carries millions of passengers a day. 
  Storming the airport
  In an effort to garner global attention, protesters occupied Hong Kong's international airport on Aug. 12. A largely peaceful sit-in, it devolved into angry clashes late in the night. Authorities have since tightened security at the airport's entrances.
   Tsuen Wan clash
  Most weekends, a portion Hong Kong's roads and highways are transformed into battlegrounds between protesters and the riot police, as was the case on Aug. 21 in this neighborhood, miles from the central business district. Most weekdays, a relative calm pervades the city.
  Tear gas in Mong Kok
  The Hong Kong police have fired thousands of rounds of tear gas, as they did in the Mong Kok neighborhood on Sept. 6. They now regularly warn residents near street clashes to stay indoors and close their windows.
  Arson in Central
  Hard-core demonstrators on the fringes of a peaceful rally set fire to an entrance to Central Station, a vital subway hub in the heart of Hong Kong's financial district.
  A flurry of arrests
  During widespread unrest in Hong Kong on Oct. 1, China's National Day, the police arrested nearly 300 people across the semiautonomous territory, including a protester in the Wong Tai Sin district. 
  A big rally
  Protesters flooded the Central business district, usually full of buses and streetcars, to drum up support for a bill moving through the United States Congress. 
  The legislation would, among other things, penalize officials in mainland China and Hong Kong who suppress freedoms in the territory. The United States House of Representatives passed the bill the next day, and the Senate is now considering a similar legislation."

The police offered protesters one way out of a besieged campus, raining down tear gas and rubber bullets on those who attempted to flee. But some escaped on rope ladders, as anxious parents sobbed near the police cordon.
HONG KONG  — Some protesters slithered down makeshift ropes to waiting motorcyclists, brazenly evading a police cordon set up around a besieged university campus.  Hundreds defied warnings to drop their homemade weapons and refused to surrender.  And a group of sobbing , blocked by officers who refused to allow them inside. 
The scenes at Hong Kong Polytechnic University on Monday were a montage of urban warfare and mayhem in the heart of the territory, roiled for nearly six months by pro-democracy protesters. The demonstrators have increasingly directed their fury at the police and the , who have dropped many hints that their patience is wearing thin.   
For days, the protesters have held off the police from entering the campus of Hong Kong Polytechnic, fortifying their holdout with homemade fire bombs, giant sling shots, bricks and bows and arrows.
At least 38 people were injured in , the city’s Hospital Authority said, after a bloody battle in which a police officer was struck by an arrow and demonstrators set a police van on fire. 
The casualties tripled on Monday, with at least 116 people injured. There were still 100 protesters remaining inside the encircled campus Tuesday, said Carrie Lam, the city’s chief executive.
As other demonstrations raged across the city, Hong Kong’s High Court offered some vindication to the protesters, striking down  in public. The court found that the ban, enacted in October, violated the territory’s mini-Constitution, know as the Basic Law.  
And in Washington, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was “gravely concerned” by the deepening chaos.
The most dramatic scenes unfolded at Hong Kong Polytechnic. As their weapons and supplies dwindled,  protesters sought to flee the campus, only to find all their routes blocked by a line of heavily armed riot police officers and a hailstorm of tear gas and rubber bullets.  
On Monday afternoon, the students tried unsuccessfully to rush a police cordon only to be pushed back into the campus. Despite running out of options,  if they obeyed police instructions to “drop their weapons” and leave through one designated exit. 
Later in the evening, a number of protesters escaped on ladders made of rope or plastic hoses, dropping down from a bridge connected to the campus, as supporters on escape motorcycles awaited them on the road below.  It was not immediately clear if any were arrested. 
The protesters, many of them university and high school students, have occupied the campus for a week. On Sunday night and well into Monday morning, they clashed with the police in  in the months of conflict. 
By nightfall, about 100 people staged a sit-in directly in front of the police cordon near the university, including women who were said to be mothers of trapped protesters, sobbing and being comforted by others. 
“Most of the people here are parents,” said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker who joined the rally. “They realize once their children get out they will be immediately arrested. They just want to take a look at their kid and see if he or she is O.K.”
Conditions on the campus have grown increasingly desperate with injured protesters unable to receive treatment, Owan Li, a student council member, told reporters. Student leaders said protesters had suffered eye injuries and hypothermia after they were struck by a stinging dye shot from a police water cannon.
Trying to mediate the stalemate, Jasper Tsang, the founder of Hong Kong’s largest pro-Beijing political party, arrived at the university late Monday evening. Mr. Tsang spoke to several protesters at a podium and said he was willing to accompany their departure from the university to help insure their safety. 
Later, dozens of  protesters lined up at the designated exit and were arrested on rioting charges by the police. It was not immediately clear whether they had departed because of Mr. Tsang’s mediation.
Areas near the university had the feel of a battle zone, with streets engulfed by tear gas and fires. 
Scores were arrested by the police on Monday morning near the university. A large group of  people were seen seated outside a hotel in the Tsim Sha Tsui district of Kowloon, their hands zip-tied behind their backs.
The police said that they arranged for Red Cross volunteers to enter the campus in the afternoon and provide first aid to the injured, and that the force would assist those who needed to go to the hospital “before further investigation,” implying that arrests would wait until after their treatments.
Fernando Cheung, a pro-democracy lawmaker who was in touch with social workers, said that some of the young people trapped inside were “close to breaking down.”
The police said 154 people were arrested over the weekend, bringing the total number of arrests to 4,491 since the protests started in June.
Xinhua, China’s state news agency, reported on Tuesday that China’s state council has appointed a new police chief for Hong Kong. The appointment of Tang Ping-keung, also known as Chris Tang, comes after the police force has been criticized by hard-liners in the country for not being aggressive enough in dealing with the protests.
The ruling that overturned the face-mask ban, issued by the city’s High Court, was a blow to the local government’s contention that the protests required the declaration of emergency powers. 
The mask ban quickly inflamed tensions in the city and set off more violent clashes. Ms. Lam, the chief executive, imposed the ban without seeking legislative approval by invoking powers granted under the rarely used Emergency Regulations Ordinance. 
In its ruling, the court said the ban violated the city’s mini-Constitution because it was too vague and endangered the ability of the Legislative Council to make the territory’s laws.
Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Chinese government’s office that handles Hong Kong affairs, criticized the court’s decision.
Mr. Yang said the ruling had “brazenly challenged the authority of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee and the governance powers of the chief executive conferred by the law,” according to an . He gave a veiled warning for the Hong Kong judiciary to fall into line, citing China’s view of the Basic Law.
“We will continue paying close attention to the developments in this case,” Mr. Yang said. “It is to be hoped that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government and judicial organs will strictly carry out their duties according to the Basic Law, and shoulder a common responsibility to halt the violence and chaos and restore order.”
Masks have been worn by protesters since the early days of the movement, as a way for protesters to conceal their identities and protect themselves from the pepper spray and tear gas routinely deployed by the police. Many protesters saw the law as a pretext that would allow officers to arrest nonviolent demonstrators in order to discourage people from joining the street actions. 
The Trump administration has been muted about its position on the Hong Kong unrest, even though many Republicans and Democrats have expressed strong support for the protesters and their cause.  
On Monday, Mr. Pompeo called for all sides in  to exercise restraint, and said the territory’s government should start an independent investigation into violent incidents that have punctuated the protests. Such an investigation presumably would include reviewing            .
Chinese leaders, on the other hand, have increasingly castigated the protesters as thugs and seditionists who have been encouraged by China’s adversaries. 
Last Thursday, President Xi Jinping of China  about the protests. According to a People’s Daily report of a speech Mr. Xi gave in Brazil, he said China “staunchly supports the Hong Kong police in sternly enforcing the law, and the Hong Kong judicial authorities in            ”

The New York Times ,2019-10-06,Hong Kong Rallies Turn Violent After Thousands Defy Face Mask Ban,1363 ,"
The rallies were the first significant public gatherings since the ban took effect the day before, and a test of the government’s resolve to stop months of protests.
HONG KONG — A jittery Hong Kong was again engulfed by clashes between protesters and the police on Sunday, hours after tens of thousands of people marched in a largely peaceful show of force against a contentious ban on face masks. 
Two large marches on Sunday afternoon were the first significant public gatherings since the ban took effect the day before, under. Despite pouring rain, angry protesters turned out en masse, many on edge from the growing violence of the recent weeks and from             around a politically important Chinese anniversary this past week.
The large marches and the widespread defiance of the ban were symbols of , and a test of the local government’s resolve and ability to stop its momentum.
Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, used a colonial-era law to try to isolate the hard-core activists at the center of recent street clashes with the police. She is under pressure to act after months of violence have strained the local economy and prompted concerns about intervention by Beijing. China’s ruling Communist Party has  to suppress the demonstrations. 
The risk is that Mrs. Lam’s move could backfire, provoking moderate protesters and exacerbating a sense that officials are infringing on the civil freedoms that the semiautonomous territory has maintainedin 1997.
Jeannie Mok, a 19-year-old student who was protesting on the Kowloon Peninsula on Sunday, said the ban had given the movement another rallying cry. She noted that many protesters felt that their cause had lost some potency in September after Mrs. Lam  the unpopular extradition bill that first inspired the pro-democracy protests this summer.
“I see more people here today, angry and ready to do more damage,” Ms. Mok said. “I don’t understand why the government would provoke when they want the protests to end.”
The marches began peacefully on Sunday afternoon, as demonstrators in face masks chanted “Hong Kongers, resist!” outside the shuttered malls and stores of the Causeway Bay shopping district.
But the marches quickly morphed into pitched battles, as protesters blocked roads, threw bricks, set fires and vandalized subway stations or stores that they perceived to be pro-government. 
“The heavens will exterminate the C.C.P.,” one protester wrote in graffiti, referring to the Chinese Communist Party.
By evening, with a drizzle of rain falling, the neighborhoods in the center of Hong Kong Island had taken on a post-apocalyptic pallor, with wide streets devoid of people and shops and restaurants shut down. A few people wandered the streets trying to hail taxis, in vain. 
Elsewhere, there was violence between protesters and other civilians. Video footage circulating online showed a group that included masked men pulling a driver out of his taxi and beating him as he bled from the head. 
Some protesters then formed a circle around the driver, in an apparent effort to protect him. Other footage seemed to show the same taxi, moments earlier, accelerating with a sharp swerve amid the crowds. 
Separately, the police said in a statement that a driver had been pulled from his taxi “after a traffic accident,” and that he lost consciousness after being beaten. It was unclear as of late Sunday night whether the statement referred to the same driver in the video, or what his medical condition was.
The protests began four months ago in  that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to the Chinese mainland. They have since evolved into a broader call to protect the high degree of autonomy that Beijing promised to grant the former British colony until at least 2047 under the city’s mini-constitution. 
Street clashes between protesters and police officers have steadily grown more combative and dangerous. On Tuesday, a protester  for the first time. Another was shot on Friday, though the police did not claim responsibility. Both were teenagers. 
The Hong Kong authorities are “using the police force to solve political problems” and stifling public opinion in a way that leaves little daylight between Hong Kong and China’s central government, said Ken Chan, a 21-year-old university student who joined Sunday’s rally in Causeway Bay.
Hong Kong has been bracing for more unrest since Friday, when the government announced the ban on face masks, which many protesters use to protect their identity and guard against tear gas. In doing so, Mrs. Lam invoked a rarely used, colonial-era law that allows for new regulations when the territory faces “a state of serious danger.” 
The ban draws on the so-called, which offers Hong Kong’s leader extensive legal authority to bypass the local legislature. It was last used during deadly pro-Communist riots in 1967 against            .
Mrs. Lam’s announcement immediately . Hong Kong came to a virtual standstill on Saturday amid a shutdown of the entire subway system, although masked protesters            .
“Maybe they’re trying a new model of dealing with the Hong Kong situation — of turning it into a de facto emergency state,” Gary Fong, a lecturer at Hong Kong Community College who studies policing strategies, said of the ban. It applies to public gatherings of more than a few dozen people and is punishable by a fine and up to a year in jail.
Enforcing the ban is likely to prove difficult, not least because face masks are so common at protests. Mr.  Fong said that the punishment of up to one year — a tenth of what protesters already face whenever they join any of the many unauthorized marches — may not prove much of a deterrent. 
The ban has already prompted stiff opposition from Mrs. Lam’s opponents in Hong Kong’s pro-democracy legislative minority. Two dozen of them took the government to court over the weekend, arguing that Mrs. Lam had overstepped her authority under the city’s mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law. 
“Today is a battle between totalitarianism and the rule of law,” one of the lawmakers, Dennis Kwok, told reporters on Sunday morning. “So the government can implement any law they want — is that the way it is now? Or is Hong Kong still a society under the rule of law?”
After a day of eerie quiet on Saturday, parts of Hong Kong and its subway system had partially returned to life by Sunday morning. But the city still felt hushed all day, even as protesters with umbrellas and gas masks squared off against the riot police.
With chaos gripping pockets of central Hong Kong on Sunday evening, some protesters sought refuge in local churches. 
At a Methodist church in Wan Chai, where scores of protesters had retreated from advancing police lines, a line of pastors stood at the glass doors while medics treated those overcome by tear gas. As protesters left, pastors wished them well and reminded everyone to take their umbrellas.
Down the street at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church — where Mrs. Lam, Hong Kong’s embattled leader, is a parishioner — more than a hundred young protesters in black shirts sat resting on the floor of a common area.
As a Mass took place in a room next door,  some of the protesters removed their black shirts and masks, and changed into civilian clothing before heading outside.

The New York Times ,2019-08-12,Protests Put Hong Kong on Collision Course With China_s Communist Party,2002 ,"
HONG KONG — As anti-government demonstrations escalate in Hong Kong, each side is staking out increasingly polarized positions, making it difficult to find a path to compromise between the protesters and China’s ruling Communist Party.
The demonstrations, which began as a fight against a bill that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be extradited to the mainland, have more broadly morphed into a call for free elections, which largely do not exist in China. To Beijing, it would be a direct challenge to the leadership, tantamount to losing control of Hong Kong.
The once peaceful demonstrations have now intensified, coming into conflict with Hong Kong’s reputation for order and efficiency. Protesters on Monday filled the airport, crippling one of the world’s busiest transportation hubs. Demonstrators , with more flights canceled that day.
China is also projecting more power, raising the possibility of more intense and more frequent clashes with the police. An official in Beijing on Monday condemned the actions of the protesters last weekend, casting it as the first signs of “terrorism.” The Chinese police also appeared to conduct large-scale exercises across the border from Hong Kong in Shenzhen, a city on the mainland.
“We are at a crossroads,” said Martin Lee, a democracy advocate and former lawmaker. “The future of Hong Kong — the future of democracy — depends on what’s going to happen in the next few months.”"
The New York Times,2019-08-14,Hong Kong Protesters Apologize After Chaos at Airport,915 ,"
HONG KONG -- Protesters began issuing apologies on Wednesday for causing disruptions at the Hong Kong airport, as fallout from scenes of violence and chaos there, along with a court injunction, threatened to eliminate the transportation hub as one of their most effective venues for demonstrations.
Protests led the airport, one of the world's busiest, to suspend check-ins for two days in a row this week, causing hundreds of flight cancellations and delivering a blow to a symbol of Hong Kong's efficiency and economic prominence. 
  The airport said Wednesday that at 2 p.m. it would begin limiting terminal access to ticketed passengers and airport workers.
  Demonstrations at the airport began Friday and stayed peaceful for days, as protesters made their case to many of the 200,000 passengers it handles each day. When disruptions to flights began on Monday, some travelers complained, but others said the movement to protect Hong Kong's civil liberties was more important than their inconvenience.
  But uglier scenes developed on Tuesday, as a few scuffles broke out between protesters and travelers, who for the first time were being blocked from the departure gates. In the evening, with tensions rising, some protesters surrounded, tied up and beat two men from mainland China -- one of whom they suspected of being a security officer, while the other proved to be a reporter for a Communist Party-owned newspaper.
  Riot police officers briefly entered the front doors of the airport, and one drew but did not fire his pistol after a scuffle with protesters.
  [Here's a guide to what prompted the Hong Kong protests and how they evolved.]
  On Wednesday, protesters seemed well aware of the negative image they had presented. ''We apologize for our behavior but we are just too scared,'' read one post on a messaging channel used by protesters, which gained wider distribution on other social media. ''Our police shot us, government betrayed us, social institutions failed us. Please help us.''
  ''Please accept our sincere apology to all travelers, press reporters, paramedics,'' read another post. ''We will learn from our mistakes. Please give us a second chance to prove ourselves that we can be better.''
  The protests -- which began over a now-suspended plan to allow extraditions to mainland China, but have grown to include calls for more direct elections and investigations into the police's use of force -- have been largely leaderless. A march in June drew as many as two million people, according to organizers, and thousands have continued to join near-daily demonstrations.
  No single voice speaks for all the participants. Some embrace nonviolence, while others say confrontation is needed because the government has ignored the calls of peaceful protesters. Thus far, protesters have embraced overall messages of solidarity, despite differing beliefs about the best strategies.
  The violence at the airport quickly received prominent coverage in mainland China's state media, which, after initially ignoring the protests, has become laden with strident criticism and misinformation about them.
  ''What a shame for Hong Kong,'' People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's main mouthpiece, said in a message on social media.
  A quote from the reporter who was beaten, ''I support the Hong Kong police,'' became a top trending term on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform. The reporter, Fu Guohao, is doing well and was not seriously injured, said Hu Xijin, editor in chief of Global Times, the nationalist tabloid that employs him.
  ''It's the utmost disgrace for the protesters to treat a reporter like this,'' Mr. Hu said in a message. ''This shows that they have lost their rationality. Hatred has muddled their minds.''
  A spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs office, the Chinese government agency that deals with the two cities, denounced the airport violence in a statement on Wednesday, calling it ''conduct close to terrorism.''
  Some protesters said that recent police tactics, including undercover officers apparently dressing as protesters to make arrests, had contributed to a sense of fear. Video of one recent arrest showed officers, one in the black T-shirt and yellow helmet commonly worn by demonstrators, grinding a protester's bloodied face into the pavement.
  ''We hope everyone, including travelers in and out of Hong Kong, would also understand the stress, the panickiness, the suspicion, the restlessness involved in the crowd at the airport ever since the Hong Kong police force's admission of masquerading a certain number of officers as protesters with the aim of getting them arrested,'' Claudia Mo, a pro-democratic legislator, said at a news conference on Wednesday.
  The Hong Kong Airport Authority said it had obtained an interim injunction to prevent interference with airport operations. It was not clear what immediate effect, if any, the injunction would have on the protests. Similar orders were used to allow workers, under the supervision of police officers and bailiffs, to dismantle protesters' encampments during the large pro-democracy demonstrations that swept Hong Kong in 2014.
  On Wednesday morning, a few dozen protesters remained in the airport, sitting in an area designated for protests. Parts of the arrivals halls were still covered with posters carrying their messages, which have focused in recent days on complaints about the police's use of force.
  ''We are not rioters, we just love HK too much,'' read one sign."
The New York Times,2019-07-14,A March in Hong Kong Devolves Into Violence,769 ,"
HONG KONG -- Several thousand demonstrators gathered in the streets of a Hong Kong border town on Saturday to protest against mainland Chinese traders, the latest effort by local activists to ride the momentum of recent mass protests in the city.
What began as a peaceful protest on Saturday in Sheung Shui, an area of Hong Kong close to the border with mainland China, devolved into clashes between demonstrators armed with umbrellas and police officers wielding batons, pepper spray and shields. 
  Several protesters were seen being treated for injuries at the scene.
  The march in Sheung Shui was the latest in a series of demonstrations that have plunged the former British colony into its biggest political crisis since it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Opposition to a contentious bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China has drawn hundreds of thousands of protesters into the streets. Tensions peaked two weeks ago when a small group of demonstrators stormed the city's legislative building.
  This week, Carrie Lam, the city's embattled leader, said that the controversial bill was ''dead'' but she has declined to formally withdraw it. Demonstrators say Mrs. Lam's steadfast refusal to completely retract the bill in the face of widespread opposition has undermined public trust in her leadership, fueling growing calls for her resignation. In recent weeks, protesters have also broadened their demands to include a call for greater democratic reforms in the city.
  The flourishing movement has given new energy to activists in border towns like Sheung Shui who have protested for years against the impact of the growing numbers of tourists and visitors from mainland China.
  On Saturday, many shops in Sheung Shui were shuttered as protesters marched through the streets shouting slogans like ''Reclaim Sheung Shui'' and ''Give us back our community!'' while demanding the withdrawal of the extradition bill and Mrs. Lam's resignation.
  Many of the protesters were residents angry with the vast numbers of so-called parallel traders who come across the border from the mainland to buy items like baby formula and diapers for resale at a markup in China to evade import taxes. Local residents say the retail boom has pushed up commercial rents and forced businesses aimed at residents to relocate or close.
  In recent weeks, some protesters have voiced concerns that the movement's growing demands could impact their ability to channel public support and sustain momentum. But on Saturday, several residents said that the disparate demands were in fact related to a single issue.
  ''People say it's a different issue, one is a local problem, the other is citywide, but the root of it is rather the same,'' said Gary Law, 32, a primary-school teacher who grew up in Sheung Shui. ''It's mostly about China.''
  Over the years, the community protests have at times taken on a nativist strain. Last fall, activists led protests in the quiet Hong Kong suburb of Tung Chung, which saw a large influx of mainland tourists after a sea bridge linked the city with Macau and mainland China. Activists sought to portray the tourists as ''invaders'' and used bullhorns to shout at visitors they accused of being ''uncivilized.''
  Last weekend, thousands of protesters rallied in the Hong Kong neighborhood of Tuen Mun against a group of middle-aged mainland women who they accused of causing a disturbance in the local park with loud singing and provocative dancing. As the protesters closed in, one woman from mainland China fled and took refuge in a public toilet for several hours before the police came to escort her away, according to  reports in the local news media.
  That nativist tone was evident once again at the protest on Saturday, which drew a smaller, mostly local crowd compared with previous protests in the city's main financial district.
  ''I want to tell those people who trade parallel goods that we Hong Kong people actually do not like what they've been doing, and that they have invaded our daily life and affected Hong Kong,'' said Cecilia Hui, 26, a resident of Sheung Shui.
  Other protesters, however, sought to keep the focus on the larger movement. Many more people are expected to turn out on Sunday for a planned protest in Sha Tin in Hong Kong's New Territories region.
  ''We have asked the government for a response, but every time they refuse to give a solid response,'' said Karina Chan, 33. ''That's why we have kept up these protests and these peaceful actions -- to let the public know that we still have the patience to wait for the government to respond.''"
The New York Times,2019-08-25,Violence Resumes as Protesters Battle Police,948 ,"
HONG KONG -- Violence returned to the streets of Hong Kong on Saturday, as the police fired tear gas and protesters threw stones and gasoline bombs, signaling the end of a period of relative calm in the city.
The clashes in the district of Kwun Tong, in eastern Kowloon, were a marked departure from the peaceful, if sometimes tense, gatherings that had taken place over much of the last two weeks. 
  Just a day earlier, antigovernment demonstrators had held hands across Hong Kong, forming human chains to demand greater democracy in the semiautonomous Chinese territory.
  Before officers wielding batons charged at a crowd Saturday afternoon in Kwun Tong, protesters had used bamboo rods and other objects to put up barricades outside a police station. Some protesters had pulled down and dismantled lampposts that they said contained high-tech surveillance equipment.
  ''We don't want to be monitored; we want human rights,'' said Calvin Wong, a 24-year-old demonstrator. ''Maybe people in the mainland accept this, but people in Hong Kong will not.''
  In a statement, the police said that protesters had started fires and hurled bricks at officers, and that the use of force had been required to scatter the crowd.
  Officers also fired tear gas in the Wong Tai Sin area Saturday evening; the police said the action was a response to protesters obstructing roads and aiming laser pointers at officers.
  The demonstrations in Hong Kong began in June over an unpopular bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. The proposal has since been shelved, but protesters are calling for it to be fully withdrawn. The movement's demands have expanded to include other issues, such as amnesty for arrested protesters and an investigation into police violence.
  Last weekend was the first in many weeks in which the demonstrations did not involve tear gas or clashes between protesters and the police. Organizers estimated that at least 1.7 million people marched peacefully through the city center under heavy rain last Sunday. The enormous turnout prompted Hong Kong's top leader, Carrie Lam, to say that she intended to start listening more to the community.
  On Saturday, as demonstrators assembled in Kwun Tong, Mrs. Lam wrote  on Facebook that the calm had made it an opportune moment for dialogue.
  ''I don't expect that dialogue will be able to easily untangle this knot, stop the demonstrations or provide a solution to the problem,'' she wrote. ''But continuing to fight is not a way out.''
  Less than two hours after Mrs. Lam's post appeared, the police were firing tear gas in Kwun Tong.
  In the afternoon, a group of protesters squared off with officers on the wide main road outside the police station. A smaller group of demonstrators retreated into an open-air shopping center after helmeted officers approached from several sides.
  There, the protesters hurled debris and other objects, including a bottle that landed among a crowd of police officers and journalists. The bottle burst into flames upon impact, and the officers responded by firing rubber bullets and tear gas in the partly covered area.
  Afterward, protesters continued throwing debris and pulled up metal drain covers to create barricades, but they dispersed after the police began moving toward them.
  The authorities had granted authorization for a march in Kwun Tong on Saturday, the 12th straight weekend of demonstrations. But at midday, Hong Kong's subway operator halted train service along a stretch near the protest route, forcing those who wanted to join the rally to walk from more distant stations.
  The subway operator said the move had been intended to ensure the safety of passengers and employees, but supporters of the protest movement called it a concession to pressure from Beijing.
  Chinese state-run news outlets criticized Hong Kong's rail operator this past week for sending trains to take protesters home after a standoff with the police at a subway station late Wednesday.
  That night, after a rally at the train station in the satellite town of Yuen Long, a large crowd of demonstrators barricaded themselves inside the station as officers with riot gear approached. The protesters heckled the officers and shined laser pointers at them, and the scene grew tense.
  But after an hour or so, station employees began announcing that trains were coming to take demonstrators back to the city. The protesters started moving away from the barricades and boarding the trains. There was no violence.
  On Thursday, however, state news media in mainland China accused Hong Kong's subway operator of ''working hand in glove with rioters.''
  ''Once violence is indulged, then public safety is no longer being taken seriously,'' read an article in People's Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper.
  The high-tech lampposts that protesters targeted on Saturday had been installed as part of a government program to collect more real-time data throughout the city over the next three years. In a discussion paper published this month, the government said that 50 lampposts had been put on the streets so far, including 10 in Kwun Tong's town center.
  Hong Kong officials had said this past week that the lampposts did not have facial recognition capabilities, and that they did not store personal data.
  Francis Fong, a member of a committee advising the Hong Kong government on the project, said that the lampposts automatically pixelated faces and license plates in the still images they took.
  Still, Mr. Fong said, ''the biggest issue is the lack of trust between the government and Hong Kong people.''

The New York Times,2019-06-26,"As Human Rights Are Threatened, Citizens Take to Streets Worldwide",1379 ,"
It seems that 2019 might be the year of the protest.
In Prague last week, Czechs gathered in the largest  demonstration since the fall of the Iron Curtain to demand the resignation of their prime minister over corruption accusations. 
  Not two weeks earlier, around a million people demonstrated in Hong Kong against a law that would permit extradition to mainland China, forcing the government to back down.
  In Kazakhstan, mass protests have led to thousands of arrests. And in Algeria, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika  left office in April after protests; President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan followed a few days later.
  The motives for each uprising are unique. But experts say there is reason to believe they are also manifestations of a global trend in which masses of ordinary citizens are demanding more accountability from those in power.
  ''Since about 2010, we have seen a seeming rise in mobilization among people who don't normally mobilize,'' said Helen Margetts, a professor at Oxford University and co-author of a book on social media and political protests. That includes ''young people, people from ethnic minorities and people in authoritarian states,'' she said.
  One reason, research suggests, is that global political shifts have created increased expectations of democratic accountability -- even in autocracies -- at the same time that authoritarianism is on the rise around the world.
  Those two trends are colliding, giving citizens more to object to just as they increasingly feel entitled to object. Also, rising distrust of political establishments is leaving many citizens wary, even in democracies, of relying on the ballot box alone. Instead, they are taking to the streets.
  And because social media has made it far easier to mobilize public sentiment and organize mass action, thwarted expectations are quicker than ever to transform into large demonstrations -- but perhaps more vulnerable than ever to falling apart before their goals are secured. That can create a self-reinforcing cycle of protest and instability.
  Great Expectations
  Since the end of the Cold War, ''everyone has to claim to be a democracy,'' said Milan Svolik, a Yale professor who studies democratization and democratic backsliding.
  Even in autocracies, political trends in recent decades have ''increased citizen expectations that governments should be accountable to their people in meaningful ways,'' two democracy experts, Thomas Carothers and Richard Youngs, wrote in a 2015 report for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
  But those increased expectations of accountability have not always matched reality. In many post-Soviet states, for instance, there was little incentive for leaders to reform police forces and other security institutions inherited from the Cold War days, said Erica Marat, a professor at the National Defense University who studies democracy and security in the former Soviet bloc.
  The result is that some of those governments, and particularly their punitive, militarized security services, did not have mechanisms in place to meet the urban middle classes' rising expectations of democratic accountability.
  That led to protests across the region, Dr. Marat said, as people realized that joining demonstrations was one of the few avenues for making political demands.
  ''Mass collective action never comes out of nowhere,'' she said. ''There are always smaller actions against the repressive state.'' These can then draw in others who are more likely to act once they see that there is public support.
  In Kazakhstan, for instance, smaller protests were part of a ''learning process,'' Dr. Marat said, which evolved into a larger mobilization.
  A similar pattern has played out in other regions as well.
  In Hong Kong, although the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests brought large numbers of people to the streets to demand democracy, they ultimately failed to force systemic change. But, Dr. Marat believes, those demonstrations may have contributed to this month's successful protests against the proposed extradition law.
  In Sudan, there were major protests in  2018 against rising food prices, followed by a schism within Mr. al-Bashir's own party in August over his plan to change the Constitution to run for president again. That led to a series of public protests against the government in the early months of this year, culminating in Mr. al-Bashir's ouster in mid-April.
  Populism and Backlash
  The conflict between democratic expectations and rising authoritarianism is also driving protests within democracies.
  Rising inequality, corruption scandals and frustration with seemingly unresponsive institutions have made the system feel less democratic to many citizens. That has led many to protest by voting in populists who promise to smash the flawed system and govern for the people.
  But once in office, such leaders often crush dissent and dismantle checks and balances, concentrating power in their own hands and further exacerbating the conflict between democracy and authoritarianism. Now, that is helping drive more mass protests.
  In Venezuela, for instance, Hugo Chávez was elected on a populist platform, but then he and his successor, Nicolás Maduro, stripped power from the legislature and packed the courts with allies. That left street protests as the main avenue for expressing dissent as the country suffered a catastrophic economic collapse.
  In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, once an extremely popular elected leader, embraced authoritarian methods and oversaw the dismantling of much of Turkish democracy.
  Turkey has not yet seen mass mobilizations like those in Hong Kong or Prague. But this week, after Mr. Erdogan's chosen candidate for Istanbul mayor lost for a second time, thousands of people rallied in celebration -- perhaps an implicit warning of what might happen if future elections are not given due deference.
  Drawing on a multiyear data set called V-Dem, the political scientists Anna Lührmann and Staffan I. Lindberg concluded that since 1994, there has been a growing wave of ''autocratization,'' with 75 countries taking significant steps toward authoritarianism.
  But even in countries where that has not happened, corruption by high-level officials, particularly if committed with seeming impunity, can stir unrest.
  The recent protests in the Czech Republic came after the police recommended fraud charges against Prime Minister Andrej Babis, who was seen as manipulating the justice ministry to prevent such charges from being filed.
  So far, Mr. Babis has refused to bow to protesters' demands, insisting that he will continue working to make the Czech Republic ''great again.''
  The Danger of Success
  Mass protest is a two-edged sword, and a rise in mass mobilizations may bring not an era of resurgent democracy but one of instability.
  A more basic phenomenon may be at play in the rise of mass protest movements: Social media, by making it far easier to spread outrage and mobilize people, has made political uprisings subject to the law of large numbers. Simply put, as many more protests are attempted, Dr. Margetts said, the number that succeed will also rise.
  But research by Zeynep Tufekci, a social scientist at the University of North Carolina, suggests protests driven by social media are especially fragile. Because they are decentralized, the movements can collapse or be co-opted more easily.
  And the gains from even successful protests can be short-lived, particularly if the new government feels pressure to consolidate power quickly.
  Protests succeed not just on their own strength but, in large part, by forcing a country's governing elites to realign their priorities and loyalties -- and by giving them an opening to do so. That realignment, however, does not always favor demonstrators.
  In Sudan, for example, Mr. al-Bashir was forced out -- but the general who consolidated power after him deployed troops against demonstrators. Dozens of people were killed, and many were brutalized. A similar story played out in Zimbabwe, where the 2017 ouster of the longtime dictator Robert Mugabe was followed by a violent crackdown.
  ''You can get people out on the street with social media,'' Dr. Margetts said. ''It's the next part that's tricky.''"

The demonstrations created the Chinese territory’s worst political crisis in years, ensnaring Beijing, Washington and foreign businesses, including the N.B.A. Here’s a guide to what’s happening.
At first, the hundreds of thousands of peaceful  demonstrators who took to the streets this June were focused on contentious, local legislation that would have allowed extraditions to the Chinese mainland. 
But as the list of demands grew in the semiautonomous territory, and as clashes between the police and the  increased, the movement took on greater global importance. 
 has viewed the protests as a challenge to its fervent nationalism, while democracy supporters worldwide have cheered what they see as a poke in the eye of the autocratic Chinese government. It all comes amid a rancorous trade war between China and the United States, and some international businesses have found themselves stuck in a political mess they wanted no part of. 
How did we get here? 
Here’s a primer on what’s happening in Hong Kong, and how the protests have unfolded over several months.
What is Hong Kong’s relationship with China?
Hong Kong, an international finance hub on China’s southern coast, was a British colony until 1997, when it was handed back to China under a policy known as “.”
The policy made Hong Kong part of China but let it keep many liberties denied to citizens on the mainland, including free speech, unrestricted internet access and the right to free assembly. The territory has its own laws, system of government and police force under a mini-constitution known as the Basic Law.  until at least 2047.
But many Hong Kongers feel that Beijing is already , and that the local government does its bidding. The territory’s top leader, the chief executive — currently Carrie Lam — is appointed by a pro-Beijing committee. And she recently used her emergency powers to single-handedly enact , bypassing the partially elected legislature. 
What’s driving the protests?
In February, the local government introduced a bill, since scrapped, that would have allowed people accused of crimes to be sent to places with which Hong Kong had no extradition treaty — , where the courts are controlled by the Communist Party. Mrs. Lam argued that the bill was needed to guarantee justice in cases like a man who was , then evaded prosecution by fleeing to Hong Kong. Critics said the bill would allow Beijing to target  in Hong Kong with phony charges, exposing activists to China’s opaque legal system.
Hundreds of thousands of people, including elderly residents and families with children, joined a peaceful march to oppose the bill on June 9. But on June 12, the discussion and demands changed when the police used pepper spray, batons and more than 150 canisters of tear gas to , a small number of whom had thrown projectiles at the police.
Irate at the police response, protesters demanded an independent investigation of the police force — a demand leaders have refused. Anger toward the police has grown precipitously since then, as has violence on both sides.
Why have the demonstrations turned violent?
Fueled by anger toward the police, as well as the slow erosion of civil liberties, the largely leaderless protests morphed into a broader, more complicated movement about protecting freedoms, democracy and Hong Kong’s autonomy. The list of protesters’ demands has grown to include amnesty for arrested participants and direct elections for all lawmakers and the chief executive.
Only one of their demands has been met: the withdrawal of the extradition bill. So protesters have continued to take over streets, and have adapted their tactics in hopes of forcing the government’s hand. 
While the vast majority of participants have been nonviolent, clashes between the police and young protesters in hard hats, masks and black T-shirts have escalated sharply. The police have used water cannons, tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets while dispersing crowds, and their tactics have been criticized by protesters and international watchdogs. Videos of particularly brutal arrests have infuriated protesters, especially a scene from October in which a police officer  with a live round.
Having felt their peaceful rallies were ineffective, a minority of protesters has become increasingly violent. The violent demonstrators have thrown bricks and Molotov cocktails, and in one case . The police say that one homemade bomb . On several occasions, protesters have doled out vigilante justice, beating people who were perceived to be against their movement. And there has been considerable property damage to the train system, which protesters have accused of supporting the police, and businesses seen as pro-China. 
Still, nonviolent protests have continued. The demonstrators have staged strikes, surrounded police stations,  and formed huge marches, while the city’s creative class has turned protest into  and . 
What are the implications for China?
Much of the international intrigue is based on closely examining how  responds to the protests, and how much democracy its leaders can stomach in its efforts to prove its model works. 
Thus far, fears of a Tiananmen-style crackdown have not borne out. The Chinese military has a garrison in Hong Kong, but its deployment is widely seen as a worst-case scenario that all sides want to avoid. The international business community would likely see a military intervention as the end of “one country, two systems,” and an exodus of businesses could soon follow. 
Instead, China has tried to turn public opinion against the protesters. The state media has depicted them as violent separatists, even though most protesters say they are uninterested in independence. The state media fanned the flames of  after a team executive expressed support of the protests on Twitter. 
The issue has added another layer of intrigue to the ongoing trade discussions between the United States and China. Democratic and Republican politicians have been largely united in support of the protests, but .
Why is there bipartisan agreement in the United States on supporting the protesters?
It’s a rare source of across-the-aisle unity. There aren’t many issues that would bring together Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democrat from New York, but they were among a bipartisan coalition to  in support of the protesters. Other politicians, including leaders Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, have been in virtually unanimous agreement. 
It stems from a shared distrust of the Chinese government, a much broader issue that often creates agreement between Republicans and Democrats. China’s authoritarian model is considered a wide-ranging threat to the United States, and the pro-democracy, anti-China sentiment of the protests aligns with popular American attitudes.
The protesters’ supporters in the United States, and elsewhere in the world, see them as being on the right side of a battle between democracy and authoritarianism. They view supporting the protesters as supporting the concept of democracy.

The New York Times,2019-09-22,Dueling Hong Kong Demonstrations End in Clashes,879 ,"
HONG KONG -- Antigovernment protesters clashed with the police and threw gasoline bombs in Hong Kong on Saturday, a fresh sign that political tensions are running high in the Chinese territory ahead of a sensitive political anniversary.
The clashes occurred after a pro-democracy march a few miles from Hong Kong's border with the Chinese mainland, and on a day when government supporters had swept the streets in a symbolic repudiation of the three-month-old protest movement. 
  This was the 16th successive weekend of unrest in the semiautonomous territory, with less than two weeks remaining before Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China under the Communist Party. Beijing does not want anything to mar the holiday, but the Hong Kong protesters seem determined to do just that.
  The first event on Saturday was a citywide ''cleanup'' led by Junius Ho, a pro-Beijing lawmaker who is among the government's most vocal defenders. He visited several districts of Hong Kong holding a broom and a dust pan, and theatrically tidied the sidewalks as television cameras rolled.
  ''National Day is almost here, plus it's the 70th anniversary this year, so we want to give Hong Kong a clean face,'' said Innes Tang, 55, a volunteer who joined one of the cleanup events.
  Mr. Ho has been regarded with particular scorn by protesters since July 21, when a group of men wearing white T-shirts attacked protesters with sticks and metal bars in the Yuen Long subway station in northwestern Hong Kong. Mr. Ho was seen shaking hands with men in similar T-shirts in the area on the same night. He later denied any connection.
  This past week, Mr. Ho called on his supporters to strip the so-called Lennon Walls of pro-democracy messages that have appeared across Hong Kong this summer, and which echo street murals that antigovernment protesters erected in 1980s Prague. He later asked them to leave the walls alone, out of a fear that stripping them could spur clashes with protesters.
  But some government supporters stripped Lennon Walls on Saturday anyway -- including in the Yuen Long district, where police officers in riot gear stood guard to protect them. And Mr. Ho said that while he did not wish to see clashes, he believed that the messages on the walls had ''created a foul atmosphere.''
  ''We want to arouse positive feelings by cleaning up Hong Kong,'' he said at a cleanup event in Tuen Mun, about six miles from Yuen Long.
  As the cleanups tapered off, thousands of antigovernment protesters were beginning a police-approved march from a park in Tuen Mun. It was designed in part to demand more regulation of buskers in the park known as ''singing aunties,'' middle-aged women who sing pop songs through loudspeakers in Mandarin, the primary form of Chinese spoken in the mainland.
  The antipathy toward those women reflects a widespread fear of the growing influence of mainland Chinese in Hong Kong, a former British colony that was handed back to Beijing's control in 1997 under a ''one country, two systems'' arrangement that guaranteed it a high degree of autonomy for a half century.
  A protester in the park, Phoenix Leung, 30, said the Tuen Mun march was part of a broader struggle for freedoms in the territory.
  ''The government wouldn't do anything about this, and it's up to us to defend the rights we're supposed to have,'' said Ms. Leung, who works in a hospital. ''The parks are for our leisure, not for their private activities or to dance and collect money; it's become like a pornographic venue.''
  The Hong Kong protests began in June in opposition to contentious legislation that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the Communist Party. The Hong Kong government has since promised to withdraw the bill, but the protests have continued anyway, driven by demands for universal suffrage, greater police accountability and other significant political reforms.
  By late Saturday afternoon in Tuen Mun, a few protesters had set a Chinese flag on fire. Previous flag-burnings this summer have angered government supporters in Hong Kong and on the Chinese mainland.
  Other protesters stormed onto the tracks of a nearby train station, breaking security cameras and glass-encased signs with metal poles. The station had been shut beforehand by the city's subway operator in anticipation of demonstrations.
  Police officers in riot gear initially watched the mayhem from a distance. But by 5 p.m. -- in scenes that have become common this summer in a normally peaceful city -- they were firing tear gas at protesters and pinning some to the ground.
  The protesters, meanwhile, were throwing bricks and gasoline bombs into the road to impede police charges, and setting fires in the streets.
  As night fell, hundreds of protesters decamped to a shopping mall near the Yuen Long subway station for a sit-in. The authorities had closed the station earlier in the day.
  One protester at the mall, Fanny Yeung, 38, said she and her family had spent more than an hour traveling there because of train closings. But she said it was worth it.
  ''This is a battle between justice and rule by terror,'' she said. ''We have to come out to say we will always stand on the side of justice.''"
The New York Times,2019-10-07,"Thousands in Hong Kong Defy Ban on Masks, and Protests Turn Violent",1315 ,"
The rallies were the first significant public gatherings since the ban took effect the day before, and a test of the government's resolve to stop months of protests.
HONG KONG -- A jittery Hong Kong was again engulfed by clashes between protesters and the police on Sunday, hours after tens of thousands of people marched in a largely peaceful show of force against a contentious ban on face masks.  
  Two large marches on Sunday afternoon were the first significant public gatherings since the ban took effect the day before, under a rarely invoked emergency powers law. Despite pouring rain, angry protesters turned out en masse, many on edge from the growing violence of the recent weeks and from patriotic celebrations around a politically important Chinese anniversary this past week.
  The large marches and the widespread defiance of the ban were symbols of the staying power of the monthslong pro-democracy movement, and a test of the local government's resolve and ability to stop its momentum.
  Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, used a colonial-era law to try to isolate the hard-core activists at the center of recent street clashes with the police. She is under pressure to act after months of violence have strained the local economy and prompted concerns about intervention by Beijing. China's ruling Communist Party has warned that it would consider using force to suppress the demonstrations. 
  The risk is that Mrs. Lam's move could backfire, provoking moderate protesters and exacerbating a sense that officials are infringing on the civil freedoms that the semiautonomous territory has maintained since its return to Chinese control in 1997.
  Jeannie Mok, a 19-year-old student who was protesting on the Kowloon Peninsula on Sunday, said the ban had given the movement another rallying cry. She noted that many protesters felt that their cause had lost some potency in September after Mrs. Lam promised to withdraw the unpopular extradition bill that first inspired the pro-democracy protests this summer.
  ''I see more people here today, angry and ready to do more damage,'' Ms. Mok said. ''I don't understand why the government would provoke when they want the protests to end.''
  The marches began peacefully on Sunday afternoon, as demonstrators in face masks chanted ''Hong Kongers, resist!'' outside the shuttered malls and stores of the Causeway Bay shopping district.
  But the marches quickly morphed into pitched battles, as protesters blocked roads, threw bricks, set fires and vandalized subway stations or stores that they perceived to be pro-government. 
  ''The heavens will exterminate the C.C.P.,'' one protester wrote in graffiti, referring to the Chinese Communist Party.
  By evening, with a drizzle of rain falling, the neighborhoods in the center of Hong Kong Island had taken on a post-apocalyptic pallor, with wide streets devoid of people and shops and restaurants shut down. A few people wandered the streets trying to hail taxis, in vain. 
  Elsewhere, there was violence between protesters and other civilians. Video footage circulating online showed a group that included masked men pulling a driver out of his taxi and beating him as he bled from the head. 
  Some protesters then formed a circle around the driver, in an apparent effort to protect him. Other footage seemed to show the same taxi, moments earlier, accelerating with a sharp swerve amid the crowds. 
  Separately, the police said in a statement that a driver had been pulled from his taxi ''after a traffic accident,'' and that he lost consciousness after being beaten. It was unclear as of late Sunday night whether the statement referred to the same driver in the video, or what his medical condition was.
  The protests began four months ago in opposition to the now-abandoned bill that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to the Chinese mainland. They have since evolved into a broader call to protect the high degree of autonomy that Beijing promised to grant the former British colony until at least 2047 under the city's mini-constitution. 
  Street clashes between protesters and police officers have steadily grown more combative and dangerous. On Tuesday, a protester was shot by the police for the first time. Another was shot on Friday, though the police did not claim responsibility. Both were teenagers. 
  The Hong Kong authorities are ''using the police force to solve political problems'' and stifling public opinion in a way that leaves little daylight between Hong Kong and China's central government, said Ken Chan, a 21-year-old university student who joined Sunday's rally in Causeway Bay.
  Hong Kong has been bracing for more unrest since Friday, when the government announced the ban on face masks, which many protesters use to protect their identity and guard against tear gas. In doing so, Mrs. Lam invoked a rarely used, colonial-era law that allows for new regulations when the territory faces ''a state of serious danger.'' 
  The ban draws on the so-called Emergency Regulations Ordinance, which offers Hong Kong's leader extensive legal authority to bypass the local legislature. It was last used during deadly pro-Communist riots in 1967 against the British colonial government.
  Mrs. Lam's announcement immediately unleashed violent protests across the city on Friday. Hong Kong came to a virtual standstill on Saturday amid a shutdown of the entire subway system, although masked protesters openly flouted the mask ban at scattered gatherings.
  ''Maybe they're trying a new model of dealing with the Hong Kong situation -- of turning it into a de facto emergency state,'' Gary Fong, a lecturer at Hong Kong Community College who studies policing strategies, said of the ban. It applies to public gatherings of more than a few dozen people and is punishable by a fine and up to a year in jail.
  Enforcing the ban is likely to prove difficult, not least because face masks are so common at protests. Mr.  Fong said that the punishment of up to one year -- a tenth of what protesters already face whenever they join any of the many unauthorized marches -- may not prove much of a deterrent. 
  The ban has already prompted stiff opposition from Mrs. Lam's opponents in Hong Kong's pro-democracy legislative minority. Two dozen of them took the government to court over the weekend, arguing that Mrs. Lam had overstepped her authority under the city's mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law. 
  ''Today is a battle between totalitarianism and the rule of law,'' one of the lawmakers, Dennis Kwok, told reporters on Sunday morning. ''So the government can implement any law they want -- is that the way it is now? Or is Hong Kong still a society under the rule of law?''
  After a day of eerie quiet on Saturday, parts of Hong Kong and its subway system had partially returned to life by Sunday morning. But the city still felt hushed all day, even as protesters with umbrellas and gas masks squared off against the riot police.
  With chaos gripping pockets of central Hong Kong on Sunday evening, some protesters sought refuge in local churches. 
  At a Methodist church in Wan Chai, where scores of protesters had retreated from advancing police lines, a line of pastors stood at the glass doors while medics treated those overcome by tear gas. As protesters left, pastors wished them well and reminded everyone to take their umbrellas.
  Down the street at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church -- where Mrs. Lam, Hong Kong's embattled leader, is a parishioner -- more than a hundred young protesters in black shirts sat resting on the floor of a common area.
  As a Mass took place in a room next door,  some of the protesters removed their black shirts and masks, and changed into civilian clothing before heading outside.

The New York Times,2019-08-16,Trump Says China Should Calm Hong Kong Before Making Deal,1330 ,"
HONG KONG -- In his most extensive comments on the months of unrest in Hong Kong, President Trump said on Wednesday that China should ''humanely'' settle the situation before a trade deal is reached.
His comments, delivered on Twitter, for the first time tied the fate of pro-democracy protesters to a trade deal with China, a top administration priority. 
  Mr. Trump praised President Xi Jinping of China as ''a great leader'' and suggested a ''personal meeting'' could help solve the crisis in Hong Kong. He also said ''China is not our problem, though Hong Kong is not helping.''
  ''Of course China wants to make a deal,'' he said. ''Let them work humanely with Hong Kong first!''
  He reiterated his support for Mr. Xi again on Thursday, saying that if the Chinese leader met personally with the protesters ''there would be a happy and enlightened ending to the Hong Kong problem.''
  [Here's a guide to why people are protesting in Hong Kong and how the movement has evolved.]
  Though the protests have been going on for more than two months, as demonstrators have filled streets and jammed airport terminals in actions that have frequently ended with violent police crackdowns, Mr. Trump had all but ignored the situation, offering just tepid, short statements. His comments on Wednesday stopped short of praising or supporting the protesters, as both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have done, and he did not explain what he meant by ''humanely'' working with Hong Kong.
  One day earlier, Mr. Trump took no stance when asked by reporters.
  ''The Hong Kong thing is a very tough situation,'' he said on Tuesday. ''Very tough. We'll see what happens. But I'm sure it'll work out.''
  He added: ''I hope it works out for everybody, including China. I hope it works out peacefully. I hope nobody gets hurt. I hope nobody gets killed.''
  He had previously called the protests ''riots,'' repeating language used by the Chinese government that is strongly disputed by protesters, and said, ''That's between Hong Kong and that's between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China.''
  [Phone checks at Hong Kong's border worry travelers to mainland China.]
  The White House's restraint on the issue has stood out in Washington, where the protests have been the source of a rare sight: broad bipartisan agreement.
  Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader; Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader; and Marco Rubio are among the Republicans who have put out full-throated statements in support of the protests. Across the aisle, Nancy Pelosi, the House majority leader; Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader; and most of the Democratic nominees for president have done the same.
  The protesters, initially stirred in opposition to a proposed law that would allow extraditions to mainland China, have expanded their demands to include universal suffrage, an independent investigation of the police's handling of the demonstrations, and amnesty for hundreds of arrested protesters. The protests have been mostly peaceful but have occasionally turned violent, including a chaotic scene at the airport Tuesday when demonstrators attacked two men from mainland China, including a journalist.
  The police have routinely used tear gas, pepper spray and batons to disperse protesters. Hong Kong officials have resisted an independent commission of inquiry into police tactics, some of which have been condemned by international groups including the United Nations Human Rights office, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The government asserts that an investigation already underway by a police watchdog is adequate, but critics say the body is staffed with pro-government figures.
  Nor have officials indicated any willingness to submit to the protesters' demands, increasing fears that the impasse could lead to a bloody, Tiananmen-style crackdown by Beijing. Mr. Trump tweeted on Tuesday that the Chinese government had moved troops to the border with Hong Kong, and encouraged everyone to be ''calm and safe.''
  A garrison of soldiers with the Chinese People's Liberation Army is stationed in Hong Kong, but most observers consider it unlikely that Beijing would use it to squelch protests unless as a last resort, as it would all but destroy the territory's autonomy and could have a devastating economic impact.
  Two outspoken Hong Kong politicians who support the protests took their message to the United States on Thursday, placing responsibility for the crisis entirely on Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong, and expressing deep concern about the possibility that Chinese forces could intervene to crush the movement.
  The politicians, Alvin Yeung and Dennis Kwok, told a forum at the Asia Society in New York that the protests had escalated because of a widening frustration at what they described as the subversion of the ''one country, two systems'' model that has governed Hong Kong since Britain's 1997 handover of sovereignty to China.
  ''The system of government no longer commands the respect of Hong Kong people -- especially young people,'' said Mr. Kwok, a member of the Legislative Council and founding member of the Civic Party. ''We deserve a much better government.''
  Mr. Leung, also a Legislative Council member and leader of the Civic Party, said that ''Hong Kong people are not asking for the moon,'' just an adherence to the Basic Law created in the handover that preserved Hong Kong's freedoms, including its political and judicial autonomy. ''We are simply asking for something as promised.''
  While both said that hints of a Chinese military intervention were worrisome, they expressed skepticism that the Chinese forces would invade Hong Kong, in large part because it remains a vital financial and investment conduit for China's economy. Mr. Kwok said such a step would ''completely destroy Hong Kong -- it would be crazy.''
  In online forums popular with protesters in Hong Kong, people largely welcomed Mr. Trump's most recent comments on Wednesday but expressed concern that the United States would not take any more significant actions. China has accused foreign countries, primarily the United States, of secretly being behind the protest movement.
  ''Every time Hong Kong has large-scale protests, not only is Washington involved but there also many American organizations at the forefront actively supporting the protesters,'' Zhao Kejin, an international studies expert at China's Tsinghua University, said during a briefing on Thursday organized by the government in Beijing. ''This is the root of why Hong Kong has become chaotic.''
  It is an accusation that is strongly denied by American officials and laughed at by protesters, who say they can organize demonstrations without help.
  Few protesters expect the United States to swoop in and solve the crisis. Instead, they have urged foreign governments to impose sanctions against China or halt the export of crowd control equipment to the Hong Kong police.
  One of them, Fiona Tsui, 23, said she was happy to see Mr. Trump paying attention, but didn't believe the White House would jeopardize a trade deal for the sake of the Hong Kong people.
  ''I hope they can put basic universal principles and moralities above their economic gains,'' she said.
  A handful of protesters have waved American flags at demonstrations, typically seen as signaling support for democracy more than an allegiance to the country.
  ''Like many protesters, we want Trump to liberate Hong Kong and to pass laws that will help the democratization of our city,'' Brian Chan, who held a large American flag, said during a march on July 21. ''We need international help, and America is the only country with the means and possibly the incentive to sanction China. They are already at trade war, and I believe that China is at the losing side.''

The New York Times ,2019-08-17,Hong Kong Protests Stay Peaceful After a Week of Unrest,979 ,"
HONG KONG — A day of demonstrations across Hong Kong on Saturday began with a peaceful teachers’ march and ended with standoffs between the police and young protesters. But after a week in which both sides were criticized for taking violence and mayhem to new levels, there were no clashes.
In the densely populated Mong Kok district, protesters gathered Saturday evening outside a police station and shined laser pointers at windows and threw eggs at the officers guarding the entrance. Officers in riot gear took over nearby streets and chased some demonstrators. But the crowds had largely dispersed by 8 p.m.
Some supporters of the protest movement may have been saving their energy for Sunday, when organizers are hoping for a large turnout in Victoria Park, in the Causeway Bay district. They had applied for a permit to march from the park to the Central district, essentially the same route taken in , but the police turned them down. Organizers have appealed that decision, saying that it puts people in danger because many are likely to march regardless.
On Saturday, young protesters distributed fliers promoting the Sunday rally. Some demonstrators chanted, “Go to Victoria Park on Aug. 18!”
Most of the protest events on Saturday were peaceful, and reflected the breadth and variety of the movement. The wave of demonstrations began more than two months ago to oppose a now-suspended bill that would allow . But the movement has broadened to include other demands, including universal suffrage and an investigation of the police.
[.] 
Brenda Chow, 55, a substitute teacher, was among the thousands who gathered in Central for the morning rally led by teachers. “We are here to protect our students, to protect our children and to voice our demands,” she said.
In the afternoon, under bursts of rain, crowds marched with umbrellas through the residential districts of Hung Hom and To Kwa Wan, an event meant to draw attention to the influx of tour groups from mainland China. Some demonstrators see the increase in visitors from the mainland as one aspect of China’s growing presence in Hong Kong, a former British colony that has been a semiautonomous territory since its return to Chinese rule in 1997.
“Our community has been disturbed,” said Andy Choi, 37, an engineer who has lived in To Kwa Wan for seven years. “Our parking lots have been remodeled as spaces for tourist buses.”
An animal-protection group had organized a rally for Saturday evening to call on the police to stop sending police dogs to protest scenes and to stop using tear gas in residential areas where it could cause discomfort to animals nearby. But organizers said early Saturday that the event had been canceled.
Protest activity in Hong Kong had quieted somewhat over the past few days, as if all sides were stopping to catch their breath. Street clashes became intense in several parts of the city last Sunday, with the police  and the authorities accusing protesters of hurling gasoline bombs.
On Tuesday,  unfolded at Hong Kong’s international airport, where demonstrators had forced flight cancellations for two straight days. Protesters confronted a man they accused of being a mainland Chinese police officer, pushing him to the ground and kicking him until he fainted, prompting an evacuation by ambulance.
They also surrounded a reporter for a Chinese state-run newspaper, bound his hands and feet, punched him and searched his belongings. Protesters later .
The United Nations human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, said this past week that there was evidence that the Hong Kong police had violated international standards for the use of less-lethal weapons like tear gas. In a statement, she urged the authorities to act with restraint.
Concerns about spiraling violence may have increased attendance at a rally Saturday afternoon meant to show support for the Hong Kong government. Tens of thousands of people gathered in a harborside park, where “Oppose Violence, Save Hong Kong” was displayed on a giant screen.
“I came here to support the police,” said Yeung Yin-yin, a 25-year-old accountant who said the protesters “had brought shame upon Hong Kong people.”
Cheung Sai-faan, 69, a retired businessman, was holding a Chinese flag and wearing another on his shoulder. “We are not opposed to peaceful protest,” he said, “but I do not like violence.”
A sign of the protest movement’s continued vitality came Friday evening, when a rally in Central drew thousands of people. The gathering was peaceful and largely over by 10 p.m.
In a leafy park surrounded by skyscrapers, the crowd watched a video message from Brian Leung, a protester known for deliberately  after he and others             in July. He has since left Hong Kong and faces possible arrest if he returns.
“Uncertainty surely abounds when it comes to my future,” Mr. Leung said. “I would still put the movement over my safety.”

The New York Times,2019-08-14,Soul Searching Among Hong Kong Protesters After Chaos at Airport,1168 ,"
HONG KONG -- Hong Kong protesters apologized on Wednesday and appeared to engage in soul searching about their increasingly confrontational tactics, after activists attacked two men at the airport in scenes that Chinese authorities described as ''close to terrorism.''
Protests this week at the airport, one of the world's busiest, caused hundreds of flight cancellations and delivered a blow to a symbol of Hong Kong's efficiency and economic prominence. 
  The airport said Wednesday that at 2 p.m. it would begin limiting terminal access to ticketed passengers and airport workers. The airport obtained a temporary court injunction, which threatened to eliminate the transportation hub as one of the protesters' most visible venues for demonstrations.
  Demonstrations at the airport began Friday and stayed peaceful for days, as protesters made their case to many of the 200,000 passengers it handles each day. But uglier scenes developed on Tuesday, as a few scuffles broke out between protesters and travelers, who for the first time were being blocked from the departure gates.
  In the evening, with tensions rising, some protesters surrounded, tied up and beat two men from mainland China -- one they suspected of being a security officer -- while the other proved to be a reporter for a Communist Party-owned newspaper. Riot police officers briefly entered the front doors of the airport, and one drew his pistol after a scuffle with protesters.
  [Here's a guide to what prompted the Hong Kong protests and how they evolved.]
  On Wednesday, protesters seemed well aware of the negative image they had presented. They are navigating a tricky situation, as continued violence by the protesters could risk losing support among the general public for their movement. In their apologies, they played to their desperation, the sense that they had limited options as the government ignored their demands.
  ''We apologize for our behavior but we are just too scared,'' read one post on a messaging channel used by protesters, which gained wider distribution on other social media. ''Our police shot us, government betrayed us, social institutions failed us. Please help us.''
  ''Please accept our sincere apology to all travelers, press reporters, paramedics,'' read another post. ''We will learn from our mistakes. Please give us a second chance to prove ourselves that we can be better.''
  Some protesters said that recent police tactics, including undercover officers apparently dressing as protesters to make arrests, had contributed to a sense of fear. Video of one recent arrest showed officers, one in the black T-shirt and yellow helmet commonly worn by demonstrators, grinding a protester's bloodied face into the pavement.
  ''We hope everyone, including travelers in and out of Hong Kong, would also understand the stress, the panickiness, the suspicion, the restlessness involved in the crowd at the airport ever since the Hong Kong police force's admission of masquerading a certain number of officers as protesters with the aim of getting them arrested,'' Claudia Mo, a pro-democratic legislator, said at a news conference on Wednesday.
  Later Wednesday night, the police fired tear gas at protesters who demonstrated in the neighborhood of Sham Shui Po, the site of a similar confrontation on Sunday.
  The protests -- which began over a now-suspended plan to allow extraditions to mainland China, but have grown to include calls for more direct elections and investigations into the police's use of force -- have been largely leaderless. A march in June drew as many as two million people, according to organizers, and thousands have continued to join near-daily demonstrations.
  No single voice speaks for all the participants. Some embrace nonviolence, while others say confrontation is needed because the government has ignored the calls of peaceful protesters. Thus far, protesters have embraced overall messages of solidarity, despite differing beliefs about the best strategies.
  On Wednesday, some cited a recent letter from Edward Leung, an influential activist imprisoned on charges of rioting and assaulting a police officer, that called on protesters to reflect on whether specific actions would help achieve their goals. It seemed to suggest the violent tactics at the airport had gone too far.
  ''Of course, true justice is still hasn't arrived, and perhaps therefore your hearts are filled with anger. This is human nature,'' he wrote. ''But I urge you not to be controlled by hatred. In a time of calamity, you must always think rationally.''
  China, which has been striking an increasingly strident tone with the protests, played up the chaos at the airport, as part of a broader propaganda push to discredit the movement. The violence at the airport by the protesters received prominent coverage in mainland China's state media. ''What a shame for Hong Kong,'' People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's main mouthpiece, said in a message on social media.
  A quote from the reporter who was beaten, ''I support the Hong Kong police,'' became a top trending term on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform. The reporter, Fu Guohao, is doing well and was not seriously injured, said Hu Xijin, editor in chief of Global Times, the nationalist tabloid that employs him.
  ''It's the utmost disgrace for the protesters to treat a reporter like this,'' Mr. Hu said in a message. ''This shows that they have lost their rationality. Hatred has muddled their minds.''
  A spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs office, the Chinese government agency that deals with the two cities, denounced the airport violence in a statement on Wednesday, calling it ''conduct close to terrorism.''
  The Hong Kong police arrested five males, ages 17 to 28, on suspicion of unlawful assembly at the airport. Two were also held for allegedly assaulting a police officer and possession of offensive weapons.
  Terence Mak, assistant police commissioner, said ''some radical protesters'' had ''harshly attacked some innocent visitors.'' He likened the assaults on the two men to torture and added that paramedics were blocked from immediately treating them.
  ''What did these visitors do to deserve such suffering?'' Mr. Mak said.
  The Hong Kong Airport Authority said it had obtained an interim injunction to prevent interference with airport operations. It was not clear what immediate effect, if any, the injunction would have on the protests. Similar orders were used to allow workers, under the supervision of police officers and bailiffs, to eventually dismantle protesters' encampments during the large pro-democracy demonstrations that swept Hong Kong in 2014.
  On Wednesday morning, a few dozen protesters remained in the airport, sitting in an area designated for protests. Parts of the arrivals halls were still covered with posters carrying their messages, which have focused in recent days on complaints about the police's use of force.
  ''We are not rioters, we just love HK too much,'' read one sign."

HONG KONG -- Over the past nearly two months, hundreds of thousands of people have braved Hong Kong's sweltering summer heat in a series of mass rallies against an unpopular bill that has come to symbolize concerns about the encroachment of the mainland Chinese government on their semiautonomous territory.
The city's beleaguered leader, Carrie Lam, has already suspended the bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China and declared it ''dead.'' But she has refused to formally withdraw it or to meet the protesters' other demands, which include the establishment of an independent commission to investigate police conduct and the right to directly elect the territory's leader. 
  Mrs. Lam's unwavering stance has helped fuel protests that now occur regularly, some of them escalating dramatically. In recent weeks, protesters have stormed the city's legislative offices, clashed with riot police officers at a luxury shopping mall and surrounded the mainland Chinese government's offices in Hong Kong.
  [For the second day in a row, thousands rallied against mob violence and what they call brutality by the police.]
  We spoke to protesters as well as pro-establishment activists and others who have been otherwise caught in the crossfire, to hear about their experiences. These are excerpts from their answers, edited for clarity and length:
  Henry Fung, 17
  A high schooler and antigovernment protester who believes forceful tactics are needed
  I haven't really protested before, not even in marches, but I feel that if I don't do something to protect freedoms I ought to have, I may never recover them again. We want to be peaceful, but under oppression, we need to resist.
  We do what peaceful protesters don't dare to do. Only after we've occupied a street or a building do they feel that it's safe to come out and sit there as well. When I walk to the front, I'm scared. I prepare myself mentally that I may get hurt and even arrested.
  My brother supports me, but he can't join the protests because of work. My father found out because my school called him when I skipped exams on June 12. He would say that it's dangerous, and that protesters who are in front, hitting the police, are rioters, and to tell me not to be like them. I feel that that's unfair to them, but I wouldn't get angry at him.
  Alexandra Wong, 63
  Retiree who is often on the front lines of protests, waving a Union Jack flag
  I wave the British flag because I want to remind middle-aged and older people to think back on 1997 (when Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese control), and what the British people have built for us. The Hong Kong government and Communist regime keep wanting to erode our freedoms, our partial democracy, core values and our rule of law.
  I didn't study politics or social science, but I simply understand how precious democracy is from life experience. I lived in Austria for 12 and a half years. I've lived in mainland China and was born and raised in Hong Kong, and have also been an immigrant in the United States. The difference in political systems can alter the people's sense of happiness so vastly -- like heaven and earth!
  I need to stand at the front with the students. I want to resist till the end with them.
  Calvin So, 23
  A cook who was in the town of Yuen Long on July 21 when a mob attacked protesters and bystanders
  It was 9:45 p.m., and I had gotten off work and was walking along a river on my way home. I saw many people in white shirts holding weapons and I said, ''Wow! So many people in white.'' Those people came over and yelled at me right after I said that. One person started to hit me, then a few more. Then they all started to hit me as I walked further. There must have been around 20 people surrounding me.
  These people beat me with things like rattan or hiking sticks. I couldn't exactly see what they were using, but I saw other people holding these weapons. I felt frightened and bewildered. There was no way I looked like their target. I didn't go to the protest.
  No one helped me. During the attack, someone threw my mobile phone into the river. I just ran away and found a convenience store where I called emergency services. Some officers arrived and an ambulance took me to a hospital.
  Perry Dino, 53
  Artist (real name: Perry Chan) who captures the protests with oil on canvas, even when tear gas is fired
  I see my role as a witness to history, not so different from reporters. I'm here to stand with the students, rain or shine. People can take thousands of photos at a protest, but I only create one painting. Photos can be deleted but to destroy my paintings, you will have to burn them.
  As I was painting on site, a foreigner asked me to sell him my painting but I told him no. I'm worried that if a painting passes through the wrong hands, it could disappear from history. I think they need to stay here so that the next generation can see it in an exhibit about Hong Kong's democracy.
  Not many paintings have tear gas as a raw material.
  Lam Ching, 28
  An instructor at an adventure camp who volunteers medical assistance at protests
  Too many people had been injured in recent clashes between police and protesters, so I decided to come out, hoping to do my part and provide them with first aid treatment.
  I feel so angry. It is supposed to be a political issue, but the government has turned it into a conflict between the police and Hong Kong people.
  We are all Hong Kong people. I really hope the Hong Kong police force can remain professional. I genuinely hope they can regain their rationality and self-possession.
  So Hiu-ching, 16
  High school student and peaceful protester
  Our society isn't thrown into chaos because of the protests. There are protests because society is in turmoil. I really want to ask the government to think about what they did this for. So much has happened and so many young people's hopes have been dashed. Can they take responsibility? Why can't you say you will withdraw the bill?
  My parents sometimes cry while watching broadcasts of the protests and would tell us, ''We are very sorry.'' I don't want to repeat this phrase to my children. I want to fight for a Hong Kong that we want, and not have to tell generation after generation that we haven't done enough. I'm very happy my parents understand this.
  There are still some conflicts though. Sometimes they would say things like, ''How can you battle with the government? You are doing so much, will it lead to anything?'' But we cannot give up because we won't win without even trying.
  He Hua, 42
  A Mandarin teacher from mainland China and a government supporter
  I love Hong Kong. I don't want it to be negatively impacted. My child goes to school in Hong Kong, I work in Hong Kong, I love Hong Kong, simple as that.
  I am here to support the police, and we have to hold up our flag because we are one collective organization.
  It's not that other people don't love Hong Kong. Perhaps they don't understand or have misunderstood, and will do many rather impulsive things. The protesters have damaged roads and the Legislative Council, which is very poor behavior. As Chinese people, we must not do that. We need to be people of conscience and morals."
The New York Times,2019-08-04,Sprawling Rally Erupts Into Violence in Hong Kong,1352 ,"
HONG KONG -- Protesters in Hong Kong kicked off three days of civil disobedience on Saturday with a sprawling march that erupted once again into violent clashes with the police, as the embattled government takes a harder line against the pro-democracy movement.
Thousands occupied a major shopping district for hours, and some attacked police officers with bricks, gasoline bombs and paint-filled bottles. Deep into Sunday morning, streets in some of the city's densest districts were convulsed by violence, clouds of tear gas and tense standoffs between protesters and riot police officers. 
  The occupations and continuing violence suggest that demonstrators are determined to keep pressing a broad range of demands for greater democracy.
  This summer's protests, which began nearly two months ago, have thrown Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese city, into its worst political crisis since Britain handed control to China in 1997. Hong Kong's government and the police are under pressure from Beijing to restore order as the protests become more unruly and as demonstrators increasingly direct their ire at mainland rule.
  The initial protests were prompted by opposition to legislation that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's unpopular chief executive, later suspended the bill and said it was ''dead.'' But she has refused to withdraw it formally, as protesters have demanded, or to make further concessions.
  The protesters are also seeking Mrs. Lam's resignation, direct elections, the retraction of the government's characterization of a protest on June 12 as a riot, the unconditional release of all protesters arrested and an independent inquiry into police violence against protesters.
  Saturday's unrest began with a police-approved march in Kowloon, a broad peninsula that sits across a harbor from Hong Kong's main island. The march drew people of all ages, including some older people who chanted, ''Protect our children!''
  But some young protesters streamed past the official endpoint, marching south into Tsim Sha Tsui, a harborfront shopping area that is popular with mainland Chinese tourists. At one point, they removed a Chinese flag from a pole and tossed it into the harbor -- a gesture that drew an outraged reply on Facebook from Leung Chun-ying, a former leader of Hong Kong.
  By nightfall, the protesters wearing hard hats and gas masks had brought traffic to a standstill and built barricades across some streets, forcing the area's luxury boutiques and other stores to close.
  Some protesters also stormed into a nearby highway and blocked the exit of a tunnel that crosses under Hong Kong's harbor. Traffic resumed about an hour later as many protesters began retracing their steps north to the neighborhood where the march had started.
  Other protesters stayed behind and surrounded the police station in Tsim Sha Tsui, a district that has rarely been the site of antigovernment demonstrations in the past. They threw bricks and glass bottles filled with paint, spray-painted obscenities on the building's facade and set a fire outside the station's entrance.
  The police presence in Kowloon was light for much of the day, but in a now-familiar pattern, riot police officers appeared on the streets after 9 p.m. They fired tear gas into the crowds in several areas, forcing some protesters to disperse. Video footage showed police officers tackling some demonstrators to the ground.
  In Mong Kok, the densely packed Kowloon neighborhood where Saturday's approved march began, police officers beat protesters with batons, a Hong Kong broadcaster reported late Saturday.
  Standoffs continued early Sunday morning in several spots. The police fired several rounds of tear gas after clashing with demonstrators in Wong Tai Sin, a working-class residential Kowloon neighborhood east of Mong Kok, and expressed ''strong condemnation'' of violence there. The police said after midnight that protesters were hurling objects, breaking windows and damaging gates at public property.
  Some protesters also threw gasoline bombs at officers, the police said, an apparent escalation in tactics. Others again briefly blocked the harbor tunnel to Hong Kong Island.
  Just after dawn broke on Sunday, the police said in a statement that they had arrested more than 20 people on suspicion of a range of offenses, including assault and unlawful assembly. They vowed to take ''resolute enforcement actions.''
  ''Police are capable and determined to maintain law and order and will not tolerate any violence,'' the statement said.
  Protesters said on Saturday they had been undeterred by the government's move days earlier to charge 44 people with rioting after clashes with the police. Rioting carries a possible prison term of up to 10 years.
  ''If I didn't come out today, I'd worry that many more people might be arrested,'' said Cliff Cheng, a flight attendant at Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based international airline.
  ''I feel both angry and distressed, because the more things we do, the more we are met with police suppression,'' Mr. Cheng, 24, added. ''I would be lying to you if I tell you I'm not worried about repercussions. But if we don't have freedom, what can we do with a job?''
  Saturday's unrest was the latest flare-up in a flurry of near-daily and sometimes unruly civil disobedience actions that have targeted major roads, shopping malls, the transportation network and other public places in a financial hub that is normally praised for its efficiency and lack of crime.
  On Friday night, a confrontation broke out in a rural satellite town in northeastern Hong Kong, as the police used pepper spray against a crowd gathered outside a police station where a local political activist, Andy Chan, and others had been detained.
  The unrest on Saturday unfolded as thousands of supporters of the city's pro-Beijing political establishment held a competing rally on Hong Kong Island, across the harbor from Kowloon.
  In recent weeks, Hong Kong's leaders have defended the police, once widely known around the region as ''Asia's finest,'' by saying that officers have acted appropriately despite the strain of weeks of protests. But that has only galvanized many in the protest movement and accentuated their demands for an independent inquiry into police conduct.
  On Friday evening, thousands of Hong Kong's civil servants demonstrated against the government after work, sending a powerful message of discontent despite stern official warnings to employees that such gatherings in the name of the Civil Service violated its code of conduct, which demands political neutrality.
  Some at the rally said they were stirred to action by the delayed police response to mob beatings of protesters in a train station on July 21, contrasting that response to the swift arrests of antigovernment protesters.
  Others have said they plan to participate in a citywide strike that protest organizers have called for Monday, which could place additional pressure on the government to meet the movement's demands.
  Mong Kok, the neighborhood where Saturday's approved march began, was the site of an all-night brawl in 2016 between protesters and the police that left several people injured and prompted the authorities to arrest dozens of people and put the district on lockdown. Those confrontations started after officers tried to shut down unlicensed food vendors and escalated when protesters set fires and threw bottles and bricks.
  China's central government initially ignored or played down this summer's demonstrations, but in recent weeks the state-run news media has begun focusing more attention on them -- effectively attributing them to malicious foreign actors rather than homegrown political problems.
  This past week, the commander of the People's Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong warned that violent protests that challenged China's political system were ''absolutely intolerable.''
  The garrison also released a promotional video that showed troops rounding up mock protesters in a drill, in which the army pledged to defend Hong Kong."

Riot police turned downtown Hong Kong into a tear-gas-filled battlefield, pushing back against demonstrators opposing a bill that would allow extradition to mainland China. 
[.]
Tear gas was deployed as protesters managed to delay the legislature’s debate. 
Riot police officers turned downtown Hong Kong into a tear-gas-filled battlefield on Wednesday as they pushed back against protesters who tried to storm Hong Kong’s Legislative Council. Demonstrators, angry over , hurled bricks, bottles and umbrellas as they clashed with the police. 
At least 72 people have been injured to date, the Hong Kong government reported, based on data from the city’s hospitals. Local news media reported that 21 police officers were injured in the clashes.
A line of protesters, many of them young people in black T-shirts, repeatedly rushed toward a ring of heavily armored police officers, only to be repelled. The  with blows, rubber bullets, beanbag rounds, pepper spray and tear gas. 
[] 
At times, only a thin metal barrier separated the two groups as the protesters’ front line slowly inched closer to the source of their anger — Hong Kong’s legislature. 
One police officer held a giant red sign warning protesters: “Stop charging or we will use force.” 
Many of the city’s lawmakers, from both the pro-democracy camp that opposes the extradition legislation  and the pro-Beijing majority that supports it, failed to arrive at the council for a scheduled debate on Wednesday morning, after protesters surrounded the complex and blocked traffic. The council later said the debate was postponed until further notice. 
Though a number of protesters turned to violence, the majority were peaceful. The police’s use of tear gas and rubber bullets was a turning point in their response to the demonstrations, and reflected the government’s determination to keep the legislature from being overrun. 
The police have not acknowledged using rubber bullets against protesters for decades. Five years ago, when tear gas was used against a student democracy protest, it  that brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets. That movement turned into a sustained occupation of several commercial districts for months in Hong Kong known as the Umbrella Movement, referring to the shield of choice used to fend off police pepper spray. 
Hundreds of protesters were in a tense standoff with the police.
By late Wednesday afternoon, the area immediately adjacent to the council had been cleared of protesters, but tear gas hung in the air in the city’s main financial and business district. So much tear gas was used that commuters at nearby subway stations and people in shopping malls were coughing and tearing up. Many sought medical attention.
Late Wednesday night, several hundred protesters remained in clusters on nearby roads in a tense standoff with riot police officers, occasionally charging at each other. 
Near a major police station in the district of Wan Chai, a few dozen police officers leapt over barricades and charged toward the protesters. Some protesters started fleeing, but others chanted: “Withdraw! Withdraw!” The police retreated behind the barricades.
Warwick Nip, a 28-year-old interior engineer with a ponytail, who kept a wet towel around his neck in case he needed relief from tear gas, sat next to two large obstacles made up of metal barricades and bamboo poles secured together. 
If the police charged, he said, he intended to remain in the front line because he wanted to “do the right thing.” 
‘Think twice,’ the police chief said in a warning to protesters.
Hong Kong’s commissioner of police described Wednesday’s demonstrations as “riots” and called on protesters to go home, warning that those who refused “might regret your decision for your entire life.”
The remarks by Commissioner Stephen Lo at a news conference came moments after protesters stormed police barricades outside the Legislative Council, leading to the use of tear gas, beanbag rounds and rubber bullets. 
“If they are peaceful protesters, please leave,” Mr. Lo said. “If they are violent protesters, then please think twice because you might regret your decision for your entire life.”
Mr. Lo said his officers had peacefully surrounded the legislature complex but would not permit demonstrators to cross over the barricade. He said it was the demonstrators who were the first to use force. 
“In terms of using violence, we have guidelines that we are following,” he said, adding that “I think we should all remember who initially started the protest.”
Hong Kong’s leader compared demonstrators to spoiled children. 
The Beijing-backed leader of Hong Kong condemned Wednesday’s violence, and gave no indication that she would stop pushing ahead with the proposed legislation that set off the protests.
“It is very clear that this is no longer a peaceful assembly but a public and organized riot,” Carrie Lam, the territory’s chief executive, said in an interview with a local television station. “And it is impossible that this is action that loves and protects Hong Kong.”
She urged the public to help restore order in Hong Kong and to resolve differences peacefully.
Earlier Wednesday and in a separate interview recorded before the protests turned violent, Ms. Lam was steadfast in her commitment to seeing the extradition bill passed and compared the protesters to spoiled children, 
“I have never felt a guilty conscience over this,” Ms. Lam said in the interview, which was taped Wednesday morning but aired in the evening after a day of protests. “I continue to hold fast to the belief that it is the right thing to do,” she told the Hong Kong broadcaster TVB, regarding the extradition bill.
In her remarks, she compared the protesters — many of whom are young — to stubborn children who did not know better.
“To draw a comparison, I’m a mother too, I have two sons,” she said. “If my son was stubborn and I spoiled him and tolerated his stubborn behavior every time, I would just be going along with him.”
The widespread public outrage over the bill puts Ms. Lam, who was selected by China’s leaders to govern the territory two years ago, in a delicate position. Backing down risks making her look weak and drawing the ire of her party benefactors, who back the bill, but moving ahead with the vote on the proposal could incite even more protests and unrest.
Small businesses support protesters, but major firms stay quiet. 
Small businesses across Hong Kong . A hotel chain offered rooms where protesters could shower and rest free of charge. At some other companies, managers let employees leave work to join the demonstrations, and union leaders told members to find creative ways to participate without calling for a strike, that included the drivers at one bus company pledging to drive below the speed limit. 
A teachers’ union encouraged members to stage walkouts and explain to young students what was happening. “This is a critical moment for Hong Kong,” the Hong Kong Professional Teachers Union said in a post on Facebook. “Educators have to uphold the responsibility of protecting conscience, and the sense of right and wrong. The union understands how striking would affect the operations of schools and sincerely asks the schools to understand.”
But Hong Kong’s most powerful voices, those of the large international banks that have long made the city a global financial hub, have remained largely quiet on the issue of extradition. 
“The extradition bill is worrying because for business it starts to call into question whether there is now a blurred line between politics and business in a city that views itself as a commercial capital that puts business first,” said Tara Joseph, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.
While the international business community has mainly worried behind boardroom doors, more than a thousand small local Hong Kong businesses closed their doors on Wednesday.
On Instagram hundreds of coffee shops, restaurants and other businesses posted pictures with the hashtag “#612strike.” One online floral company called Floraholic wrote, “Hong Kong is sick, let’s take a day off for some rest!           .”
“Striking is the only action we could take,” said Yanki Lam, the owner of a shop in the Kowloon district of the city. 
Critics say the bill puts anyone at risk of trial in the mainland. 
The measure that set off the protests would allow Hong Kong to detain and transfer people wanted in countries and territories with which it has no formal extradition agreements, including Taiwan and the Chinese mainland. 
Ms. Lam, the Hong Kong chief executive, has said the new law is urgently needed to prosecute a Hong Kong man who is . But the authorities in Taiwan, a self-governed island claimed by Beijing, say they would not agree to the extradition arrangement because it would treat Taiwan as part of China.
Critics contend that the law would allow virtually anyone in the city to be picked up and put on trial in mainland China, where judges must follow the orders of the Communist Party. They fear the new law would not just target criminals but political activists as well.
The extradition plan applies to 37 crimes. That excludes political ones, but critics fear the legislation would essentially legalize the sort of abductions to the mainland that have taken place in Hong Kong in recent years. The mainland Chinese authorities are typically not permitted to operate in the semiautonomous territory.

The New York Times ,2019-09-01,Hong Kong Protesters Squeeze Access to the Airport,1476 ,"
HONG KONG — Pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong began a new campaign on Sunday to squeeze access to the airport, hours after  in June.
Tens of thousands of people marched through parts of the city center on Saturday despite a ban on the protest by the police. Some protesters gathered around the local government’s headquarters, where they threw bricks and firebombs as the police responded with tear gas, pepper spray and water cannons.
On Sunday, demonstrators began congregating at Hong Kong International Airport in a new effort to obstruct access to the critical Asian travel hub. The airport has been off limits to protesters since mid-August, when  on two men from mainland China and hundreds of canceled flights.
With classes set to begin on Monday for many Hong Kong students, schools could become the next front in the protest movement, which began over widespread anger over an extradition bill that would allow criminal suspects to be taken to mainland China. Since then, demonstrators’ demands have grown to include a call for universal suffrage and an inquiry into accusations of police brutality.
[.]
Hundreds of protesters began to converge on the airport Sunday afternoon, traveling by bus, by car and on foot from a nearby subway station. A court injunction obtained after the airport protests last month allows only ticketed passengers and airport employees to enter the main terminals. But demonstrators gathered outside near the entrances, chanting, “Fight for freedom! Stand with Hong Kong.” Some used their cars to block lanes of traffic.
“We have been protesting and occupying for months,” said Daniel Chan, 18, a college student who took a bus to the airport protest. “Still, what we have done seems futile.”
Mr. Chan said he did not intend to do anything illegal, but he was not concerned about the court injunction. “There’s almost nothing left for me to be scared of,” he said. “One document cannot deter me.”
MTR, the Hong Kong subway operator, announced on Sunday afternoon that the Airport Express rail service between the airport and the city center was canceled, and trains to the city were later suspended after protesters threw debris on the tracks. Tung Chung Station, one of the subway stops closest to the airport, was also closed on Sunday evening because protesters had damaged the station, MTR said.
[City on edge:            
The protests forced many travelers to find alternative routes to the airport. Nicole Zhao, 38, was one of many who had to wend, dodge and hopscotch their way through barriers that had been set up on the roads.
Ms. Zhao, who is from mainland China and works in education, had just landed in Hong Kong from Beijing when she received a notice from the airline suggesting that she postpone her trip.
“What the protesters are doing is crazy,” she said. “This just shows how different the Hong Kong and mainland systems are.”
Other travelers were more supportive of the protests.
Eric Jabal, 47, an education consultant, walked with his roller suitcase and suit jacket on a debris-strewn road, dodging protesters and barricades. He said he had left his home at 12:30 p.m. for an 8:50 p.m. flight to Bangalore and had been walking for 25 minutes after he had been dropped off by an Uber.
But Mr. Jabal, a Canadian who has been living in Hong Kong for 25 years, said he didn’t mind the inconvenience.
“I’m really sad,” he said. “That the failure of leadership has led to such profound unrest among such a broad cross section of people — it’s clearly gone beyond the tipping point.”
Students have been a major part of the protests all summer, and the beginning of classes on Monday raised questions about whether the start of school would mean a lessening of the movement or whether activism would shift to campuses.
Students have planned two mass assemblies, one in the central business district in the morning and another after school at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Many high school students have also negotiated with school administrators to participate in sit-ins or to set aside classrooms for self-study sessions or silent protests on the first day of school.
Education authorities said that students would need parent letters to skip class or to participate in strike activities.
A top government official said on Sunday that the administration “steadfastly opposed” the planned class boycotts, calling them extremely irresponsible.
“Schools are places for learning, and are absolutely not places for expressing political views or demands,” Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung .
Earlier Sunday, the Hong Kong police said that they had arrested dozens of people in a subway station that was the scene of some of the most intense violence of the weekend, where officers used clubs and pepper spray on a group of protesters inside a train car.
News footage and videos shared on social media showed members of the police Special Tactical Squad, in dark uniforms with their faces covered, charging into a waiting train car at Prince Edward Station and swinging batons at men and women who cowered on the floor, offering no resistance. After a fury of blows, one officer doused the group in pepper spray and then left.
“The police were out of control,” said Crystal Yip, a 20-year-old college student who was in the station when officers arrived. “They were crazy and they were mad. They were trying to express their anger by attacking people randomly.”
Yolanda Yu, police senior superintendent, said 40 people were arrested in the station on suspicion of unlawful assembly, criminal damages and obstructing officers.
“Protesters used sticks and hard objects to attack police. We used the same level of force to respond to the situation,” Ms. Yu said, replying to a reporter asking why the police had used pepper spray on commuters who were kneeling on the ground.
She said that the police had warned civilians to stay away. “Under chaotic situations, it is indeed hard to determine whether someone is a real journalist, a protester or a violent person,” she said.
The violence in Prince Edward Station began during  who were insulting them. One of the men swung a hammer at the protesters, who threw water bottles and umbrellas and later appeared to set off fire extinguishers in the car. After the clashes, the subway system suspended service across much of Hong Kong. Three stations remained closed on Sunday.
The subway operator, MTR, has been a target of vandalism since it began suspending service last month to stations in places near where protests are planned. It continued that pattern on Saturday, stopping service at Sai Ying Pun Station, near the Chinese government liaison office, a site of some protests.
In the wake of the clashes, Chinese news outlets run by the Communist Party urged the Hong Kong government to take tough steps against the protesters and cited experts urging Carrie Lam, the chief executive of the city, to invoke emergency powers. An online outlet controlled by the Communist Party’s law-and-order committee said the Hong Kong protesters 
“The chaos in Hong Kong cannot go on!” a front-page editorial in the overseas edition of People’s Daily, the party’s main newspaper, . “At this crucial moment, the government of the special administrative region must have the courage and adeptness to apply every legal means to halt the violence and chaos, acting resolutely to detain and arrest violent lawbreakers, applying the law strictly to punish criminals, and swiftly restoring social order.”
An , CCTV, said that Mrs. Lam should invoke emergency powers under a colonial-era ordinance to extinguish the violent protests. That step could empower the Hong Kong government to ban demonstrators from wearing masks, speed up arrests and censor “harmful media,” the report said.

HONG KONG — Antigovernment demonstrators angered by the shooting of a  demonstrator fanned out across the city on Tuesday, blocking major transit arteries and staging a fiery standoff against riot police officers on the fringes of a .

The protests in the semiautonomous Chinese city . The demonstrations have since morphed into calls for greater democracy and police accountability.
Here’s the latest on the Hong Kong protests.
University campuses are new flash points.
Black-clad student demonstrators have been making a concerted effort to defend their campuses against what they see as unwarranted police encroachment.
On Tuesday, protesters at the Chinese University of Hong Kong built roadblocks outside an entrance while police officers elsewhere tackled demonstrators to the ground and fired tear gas at a group gathered on a sports field. 
As the clashes escalated in the evening, the university’s vice chancellor, Rocky Tuan, met with students in hopes of brokering a cease-fire between protesters and the police. 
“The deal is that we each need to take a step back,” he said as he urged the students not to escalate the confrontation. In response, the students shouted: “We don’t believe you!” They repeatedly interrupted him and called for the release of students who had been arrested.
Barely minutes after Mr. Tuan left the site, the police fired tear gas at the protesters. 
The protesters poured more fuel onto a large barricade that they had already set ablaze. They hurled gasoline bombs, set off fireworks and chanted: “Reclaim Hong Kong, a revolution of our times,” a popular protest slogan. 
Officers fired a barrage of tear gas over the blockade, sending protesters scrambling. At least 30 people were being treated Tuesday night in a makeshift first-aid center on campus, apparently for exposure to tear gas and injuries from rubber bullets. 
Around 10 p.m., police cannons briefly sprayed blue-dyed water at protesters. Groups of officers began to retreat soon afterward, with the smell of tear gas and pepper spray still heavy on the air. 
Even though many confrontational protesters are undergraduates, violence on the campuses of Hong Kong’s universities has been rare. The university said that classes would be canceled on Wednesday for a third straight day in light of road blockages, “severe damage” to campus facilities and the “high risk of ongoing confrontation between protesters and the police.”
Leader chides protesters for transit chaos.
Carrie Lam, , criticized protesters on Tuesday for disrupting transit, saying that they were “extremely selfish” for wanting to paralyze Hong Kong.
Mrs. Lam told reporters that the protesters were out to “create a phenomenon in which Hong Kong seems to have come to a standstill and people are not able to go to work and go to school.” 
School administrators should urge students to stop taking part in illegal activities, she said, adding that her government would do its “very best” to ensure that  were held in a “fair, just, safe, orderly” manner.
Separately, People’s Daily, an official government newspaper in mainland China, said in a commentary: “Only by supporting the police force to decisively put down the riots can a peaceful environment be restored and fair elections be held, and help Hong Kong start again.”
There was more unrest downtown.
Hundreds of protesters, including many office workers, stormed Hong Kong’s central business district at lunchtime. Some formed human chains to pass along bags of bricks that front line activists were using to block traffic.
Across the harbor, activists in the Mong Kok neighborhood placed barricades in front of buses and punctured their tires. 
The city’s subway operator said on Tuesday morning that services were also delayed after gasoline bombs had been thrown onto the tracks of a major rail line that runs to the border of the Chinese mainland. 
Large groups of commuters were seen walking along the line’s tracks — a rare scene in a city known for its efficiency and order.
The protests follow a day of widespread violence.
The demonstrations on Monday . Mrs. Lam, the city’s leader, called the combative protesters “enemies of the people” and warned that the city’s escalating unrest could take it on the “road of ruin.”
A police officer shot a black-clad protester at point-blank range on Monday morning in a neighborhood where traffic had been snarled by roadblocks. Elsewhere, a man was doused with a flammable liquid and set on fire after he scolded protesters, video footage shows. The police have said they are treating the immolation as an attempted murder.
The medical status of the protester who was shot had improved to serious from critical condition by Tuesday morning, the Hospital Authority said. But the man who had been set on fire remained in critical condition.
Tensions in Hong Kong had been building after the who fell from a parking garage amid demonstrations.
The police said that 287 people were arrested on Monday, the majority of them students. 
The State Department urged both sides to exercise restraint.
On Monday night in Washington, the State Department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, said the United States government condemned “violence on all sides"" in Hong Kong and urged the government to “address the underlying concerns driving the protests.”
Ms. Ortagus also reminded the Hong Kong government that the United States grants it a favorable trade status unlike that of mainland China, but only under specific conditions.

The New York Times,2019-08-11,Unrest in Many Forms in Day of Hong Kong Protest,1003 ,"
HONG KONG -- Defying warnings from China of a crackdown if they continued more than two months of protests, young demonstrators blocked a vital tunnel under Hong Kong's Victoria Harbor on Saturday, barricaded a traffic intersection and set fires outside a police station in a shopping district popular with tourists.
The Hong Kong police force said in a statement that the fires in the Tsim Sha Tsui district of the city posed ''a serious threat to the safety of everyone at the scene.'' 
  Police officers fired tear gas in several locations as a day that began with a show of peaceful defiance outside the headquarters of China's military garrison descended into an evening of clashes, panic and widespread disruption.
  Thousands of activists continued a sit-in at Hong Kong's international airport, one of the world's busiest air-travel hubs, on the second day of what they said would be a three-day occupation. The airport demonstration, unlike scattered and often-chaotic protests on the Kowloon Peninsula on Saturday evening, has so far been peaceful.
  Stores along Nathan Road, normally crowded with evening shoppers and tourists, closed their doors as the police moved into the area, charging into passers-by caught up in a melee that was shrouded in clouds of tear gas.
  Amy Havart, a 32-year-old Hong Kong resident, said she had been leaving a hotel on Nathan Road after drinks with friends when hotel staff members ''told us that the police are dropping tear gas outside; we don't know what is happening at all.''
  She said she could not see any protesters or acts of violence so could not understand why there were so many police officers.
  ''We are all just here trying to have some fun tonight. So why are the police here?'' she asked. ''I don't know what is happening to this city. This is just heartbreaking to see.''
  [What's going on in Hong Kong? Here's how the protests have evolved.]
  Assailed for days by China's propaganda machine as violent thugs who must be stopped, Hong Kong's protest movement -- a largely leaderless jumble of groups and causes -- started the day with a display of what activists say was their peaceful intent. Several thousand people marched in an orderly procession past China's military headquarters in the former British colony.
  That protest march in Central District, billed by organizers as a ''family friendly'' event, featured parents, baby strollers and children with balloons, and avoided incendiary slogans about ''retaking Hong Kong'' that have angered China's governing Communist Party.
  ''Xi Jinping should come and take a look at us here, now, and then say whether we are hooligans,'' said Ina Wong, a 34-year-old designer, referring to China's hard-line leader. Ms. Wong took part in the rally along with her husband, a civil servant, and their 2-year-old son.
  But the mood turned grimmer as darkness fell and the Kowloon Peninsula, across Victoria Harbor, became the focus for a new round of protests, which, unlike the morning rally in Central, had not been authorized by the police.
  The number of protesters was far below the huge demonstrations last month, and Saturday evening's events in Kowloon were driven largely by groups of a few hundred activists who roamed from area to area in an effort to avoid arrest for participation in an unauthorized gathering. After one group blocked a tunnel under the harbor from Kowloon to Central in the early evening, a different group occupied the entrance to the Lion Rock Tunnel, under a mountain in Kowloon.
  The blocking of roads and tunnels recalled some of the disarray that convulsed Hong Kong on Monday, when a wave of protest rallies and strikes bought much of the city to a standstill, with the police and demonstrators clashing in several areas. Monday's unrest prompted a barrage of warnings from the Communist Party in Beijing and its allies in Hong Kong that further unrest would not be tolerated.
  On Saturday, party-controlled newspapers in Hong Kong published what they said was an open letter signed by more than 700 patriotic residents voicing support for the city's police, whom protesters have accused of brutality, and demanding that the local government ''swiftly stop this chaotic situation.''
  The letter, and a series of small counterprotests in support of the government, followed a demand this past week from Beijing's top official responsible for Hong Kong that China's supporters there speak out against the protest movement and mobilize to resist any concessions to its demands.
  Those demands include the resignation of Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, as well as an independent inquiry into the police's conduct and the full withdrawal of the extradition bill that sparked the protests.
  China's characterization of the Hong Kong protests as ''turmoil'' -- the word it used to describe protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989 -- has fueled rumors that another crackdown was being planned. But few expect China to send in the People's Liberation Army, as it did to crush the student-led Tiananmen movement 30 years ago.
  Watched by a lone Chinese soldier with an assault rifle guarding the gate to China's military compound in Central, the morning protesters marched without incident past the garrison, shouting, ''Go, Hong Kong! Go, Hong Kong! Fathers and mothers, please preserve our future!''
  They ended their parade outside the offices of Hong Kong's Legislative Council, a body that helped to spur the protest movement by moving in June to adopt legislation that would allow extradition to mainland China. Mrs. Lam, the chief executive, has since suspended the bill, but she has resisted demands that it be formally withdrawn.
  Many in Hong Kong are not willing to accept Mrs. Lam's assurances that the bill is ''dead.''
  ''People don't trust the government. This is the main problem,'' said Ken Lin, an unemployed 39-year-old office worker who helped organize the Saturday march. ''The government only obeys Beijing, not what the people of Hong Kong want.''"
The New York Times,2019-10-24,"From Chile to Lebanon , Protests Flare Over Wallet Issues",1662 ,"
Pocketbook items have become the catalysts for popular fury across the globe in recent weeks.
LONDON -- In Chile, the spark was an increase in subway fares. In Lebanon, it was a tax on WhatsApp calls. The government of Saudi Arabia moved against hookah pipes. In India, it was about onions. 
  Small pocketbook items became the focus of popular fury across the globe in recent weeks, as frustrated citizens filled the streets for unexpected protests that tapped into a wellspring of bubbling frustration at a class of political elites seen as irredeemably corrupt or hopelessly unjust or both. They followed mass demonstrations in Bolivia, Spain, Iraq and Russia and before that the Czech Republic, Algeria, Sudan and Kazakhstan in what has been a steady drumbeat of unrest over the past few months.
  At first glance, many of the demonstrations were linked by little more than tactics. Weeks of unremitting civil disobedience in Hong Kong set the template for a confrontational approach driven by vastly different economic or political demands.
  Yet in many of the restive countries, experts discern a pattern: a louder-than-usual howl against elites in countries where democracy is a source of disappointment, corruption is seen as brazen, and a tiny political class lives large while the younger generation struggles to get by.
  ''It's young people who have had enough,'' said Ali H. Soufan, chief executive of The Soufan Group, a security intelligence consultancy. ''This new generation are not buying into what they see as the corrupt order of the political and economic elite in their own countries. They want a change.''
  Few were as surprised as the leaders of those countries.
  On Thursday, the President Sebastián Piñera of Chile boasted that his country was an oasis of stability in Latin America. ''We are ready to do everything to not fall into populism, into demagoguery,'' he said in an interview published in The Financial Times.
  The next day, protesters attacked factories, torched subway stations and looted supermarkets in Chile's worst upheaval in decades, eventually forcing Mr. Piñera to deploy troops to the streets. By Wednesday, at least 15 people were dead, and a clearly rattled Mr. Piñera had spoken of ''war against a powerful and implacable enemy.''
  In Lebanon, Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri survived recent embarrassing revelations about a $16 million gift to a bikini model whom he met at a luxury resort in the Seychelles in 2013, a move that, for some critics, epitomized Lebanon's ruling class. Then last week he announced the tax on WhatsApp calls, setting off a revolt.
  Decades of discontent over inequality, stagnation and corruption erupted into the open, drawing as much as a quarter of the country into euphoric antigovernment demonstrations driven by chants of ''Revolution!''
  With one of the highest levels of public debt and intractably low employment, Lebanon seems incapable of providing basic public services like electricity, clean drinking water or reliable internet service. Austerity measures have hollowed out the middle class, while the richest 0.1 percent of the population -- which includes many politicians -- earns a tenth of the country's national income, much of it, critics say, from plundering the country's resources.
  On Monday Mr. Hariri scrapped the planned tax, announcing a hasty reform package to rescue the country's sclerotic economy and pledging to recover public trust.
  Although the recent scattering of mass protests appears dramatic, scholars say it is a continuation of a rising trend. For decades, societies across the world have become far likelier to pursue sweeping political change by taking to the streets.
  The rate of protest has accelerated sharply of late, as various factors have converged: a slowing global economy, dizzying gaps between rich and poor and a youth bulge that in many countries has produced a restive new generation fizzing with frustrated ambition. In addition, the expansion of democracy has stalled globally, leaving citizens with unresponsive governments frustrated and activists sure that street action is the only way to force change.
  But as protest movements grow, their success rates are plunging. Only 20 years ago, 70 percent of protests demanding systemic political change achieved it -- a figure that had been growing steadily since the 1950s, according to a study by Erica Chenoweth, a Harvard University political scientist.
  In the mid-2000s, that trend reversed. Success rates now stand at 30 percent,  the study said, a decline that Professor Chenoweth called staggering.
  These two trends are closely linked. As protests become more frequent but likelier to flounder, they stretch on and on, becoming more contentious, more visible -- and more apt to return to the streets when their demands go unmet. The result may be a world where popular uprisings lose their prominence, becoming simply part of the landscape.
  ''Something has really shifted,'' Professor Chenoweth said in an interview.
  ''You could say these protests mirror what's going on in the United States,'' said Vali Nasr, a Middle East scholar who recently stepped down as dean of Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. In countries where elections are decisive, like the United States and Britain, skepticism about the old political order has produced populist, nationalist and anti-immigrant results at the polls.
  ''In other countries, where people don't have a voice, you have massive protests erupting,'' he said.
  The disparate outbreaks of unrest have not gone unnoticed at the United Nations. Secretary General António Guterres raised them at a meeting of the International Monetary Fund this past weekend, his spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, said on Tuesday. Critics have accused the I.M.F. of exacerbating economic hardships in countries like Ecuador through austerity measures imposed to reduce debts.
  ''We are seeing demonstrations in different places, but there are some commonalities,'' Mr. Dujarric said, citing ''people feeling they are under extreme financial pressure, the issue of inequality, and a lot of other structural issues.''
  Some experts say the rash of global protests is too diverse to neatly categorize or ascribe to a single theme. Michael Ignatieff, president of Central European University, was in Barcelona last week as more than 500,000 people thronged the streets after a court sentenced former separatist leaders to prison.
  While the Barcelona protests bore some resemblance to mass demonstrations in other cities, Mr. Ignatieff said it would be a mistake to lump them together. ''People are not being swept away by the madness of the crowds,'' he said. ''This is politics, with specific causes and specific issues. If you don't acknowledge that, you make popular politics look like a series of crazy fashions, like the same trousers or headgear.''
  Still, within some regions, the protests are often similar to each other. 
  In the Middle East, the tumult has drawn inevitable comparisons with the upheavals of the Arab Spring of 2011. But experts say these recent protests are driven by a new generation that cares less about the old sectarian or ideological divides.
  Instead of calling for the head of a dictator as many Arabs did in 2011, the Lebanese have indicted an entire political class.
  ''They are stealing and pretending that they aren't. Who's responsible, if not them?'' Dany Yacoub, 22, said on Monday, the fourth day she had spent protesting in central Beirut. She studied to be a music teacher, but said she cannot find a job because it takes political connections to get hired in a school. ''We don't believe them anymore,'' she said.
  Many Arabs have been wary of popular protest since the Arab Spring uprisings, heeding doom-tinged warnings from authoritarian leaders that any upheaval could tip their societies into the same violent chaos as Libya, Syria or Yemen.
  But the recent wave of protests in Lebanon, Egypt and Iraq -- as well as revolts that toppled longstanding dictators in Algeria and Sudan this year -- suggest that wall of fear is starting to crumble.
  ''Syria has been the boogeyman for a very long time,'' said Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. ''But Algeria and Sudan showed that chaos does not have to be the answer.''
  Even in Saudi Arabia, where the threat of government repression makes public protests practically unthinkable, an unusual rebellion erupted on social media over a 100 percent tax on bills at restaurants with water pipes, or hookahs. The Arabic hashtag ''tax on hookah restaurants'' trended in the kingdom. Some Twitter commentators said the tax contradicted the ruling family's desire to change Saudi Arabia's ultraconservative image.
  If protests are quicker to stir and more widespread than in earlier decades, they are also more fragile. The painstaking mobilization that once was a feature of grass-roots movements was slow but durable. Protests that organize on social media can rise faster, but collapse just as quickly.
  Authoritarian governments have also learned to co-opt social media, using it to disseminate propaganda, rally sympathizers or simply spread confusion, Professor Chenoweth said.
  And even where there is a spasm of protest, it takes a lot more for it to snowball into a full opposition movement. The soaring price of onions in India caused farmers to block highways and mount short-lived protests. But frustration has yet to sharpen into mass demonstrations because there is nobody to channel it: India's opposition is in disarray; divisions of caste and religion dominate politics; and the government of the Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, constantly raises the threat of neighboring Pakistan to distract the public.

The New York Times,2019-08-12,Hong Kong Police and Protesters Show Signs of Escalating Conflict,1121 ,"
HONG KONG -- Hong Kong was convulsed by mass demonstrations and chaos for a second straight day on Sunday, as the police fired tear gas into a subway station and the authorities accused protesters of attacking officers with gasoline bombs.
The unrest in several downtown districts came in the 10th weekend of protests in the semiautonomous Chinese territory and capped a week in which the protest movement mounted its fiercest resistance yet to Beijing's rule of the former British colony. 
  The chaos and uncertainty, in which the police said some protesters threw gasoline bombs at them, came six days after a general strike and street clashes brought much of the financial hub to a rare standstill.
  Those demonstrations prompted Beijing to sternly warn the protesters not to test its resolve and to warn of retribution from the ''sword of law.''
  [Why are people protesting in Hong Kong? Find out here.]
  Top Chinese officials have said the demonstrations ''have the clear characteristics of a color revolution,'' a reference to uprisings in the former Soviet bloc that Beijing believes drew inspiration from the United States, and they accused an American diplomat -- without evidence -- of being a ''black hand'' bent on stirring chaos in the territory.
  For now at least, protesters seem determined to keep pressing their broad demands for greater democracy, in part by using flash-mob-style tactics on the streets that keep the authorities guessing their next move.
  The Hong Kong police, meanwhile, appear increasingly eager to clear away the crowds and spray tear gas in residential neighborhoods and popular shopping and night-life districts -- even as those tactics outrage residents and help the protesters' argument that the police force has gone rogue.
  The use of gasoline bombs by protesters -- which has been fairly rare all summer -- in Sunday's unrest suggested a possible escalation in the movement's tactics.
  The civil disobedience began in the afternoon with a peaceful rally in Victoria Park on Hong Kong Island that had been authorized by the police. The protesters had been expected to march east from the park to nearby North Point, a traditionally pro-Beijing neighborhood and the site of a mob attack on protesters last week.
  Instead, the protesters headed in the opposite direction along a major thoroughfare, bringing traffic to a halt and leaving their next moves unclear.
  ''We no longer demonstrate based on a schedule, which I think works well,'' said Dominic Chan, 26, a protester who works in retail. ''We spread to different places, because every arrest means one less protester in the field.''
  [Here are the creative ways Hong Kong's protesters are organizing.]
  Some protesters tried to approach the headquarters of the Hong Kong police, west of Victoria Park, but retreated as officers charged at them and fired tear gas in Wan Chai, a downtown neighborhood whose bars and restaurants are popular with expatriates. The police said that protesters had also thrown gasoline bombs at officers in the area.
  Officers fired tear gas at other protesters in Sham Shui Po and Tsim Sha Tsui, two neighborhoods on the Kowloon peninsula, across a glittering harbor from Hong Kong Island. The police later said that an officer from Tsim Sha Tsui had suffered burns on his legs from a gasoline bomb.
  Television footage from Kowloon showed police officers in riot gear charging at protesters and tackling some of them to ground or hitting them with batons. The police said in a statement that some protesters had been hurling bricks at officers, ''posing a threat to the safety of everyone at scene.''
  A few districts north, television footage showed police officers firing tear gas into the Kwai Fong subway station, near a police station where protesters had gathered. It appeared to be the first time that the police had resorted to that tactic in an effort to clear demonstrators.
  Sunday was also the third day of a peaceful demonstration at Hong Kong International Airport, one of the world's busiest, for which protesters did not seek police permission.
  There had been panic and widespread disruption in the city on Saturday, too, as protesters hopscotched around Kowloon and the police fired tear gas in several locations. Smaller groups of demonstrators blocked a vital cross-harbor tunnel, barricaded a traffic intersection and set fires outside a police station in the Tsim Sha Tsui district.
  The protests began two months ago in opposition to legislation that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the governing Communist Party. They have since spiraled into Hong Kong's worst political crisis since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997, with protesters demanding the resignation of Hong Kong's embattled chief executive, Carrie Lam.
  One of the movement's biggest events this summer was last Monday, when a general strike and set of protest rallies disrupted businesses and transportation in a city known for its order and efficiency. That evening, men wearing white shirts and wielding sticks briefly attacked a group of black-clad protesters in North Point. Those men were widely believed to be members of local gangs, although no conclusive proof of that has emerged.
  The police made 148 arrests during the general strike, though they did not specify how many were linked to the North Point violence. Ng Wun-yim, the chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Fujian Associations, later told reporters that the associations had played no part in the street brawl.
  ''We don't want to see violence,'' he said on Saturday. ''Hong Kong is a civilized society.''
  Still, one of his colleagues, Lo Man-tuen, said that local Fujianese would not hesitate to defend themselves if provoked. And ahead of Sunday's unrest, there were widespread fears that groups of Fujianese gangsters might again assault protesters in North Point.
  Last week's mob attack was reminiscent of another clash on July 21, in which a pro-Beijing mob beat protesters and bystanders in Yuen Long, a satellite town in northwestern Hong Kong that is not far from the Chinese mainland. North Point residents have been on edge all week, and many stores there were closed on Sunday.
  Red banners plastered around North Point on Sunday, apparently by residents, urged Fujianese to ''protect'' their home.
  Scuffles later broke out there between some Fujianese men and journalists who were trying to film them, video footage showed, and young man in a black shirt was assaulted by a group of middle-aged men with sticks. He was later carried into an ambulance on a stretcher with a bloody mouth.
  It was not immediately clear why the men had attacked him."

Escalating rhetoric reveals how seriously Beijing views the unrest in Hong Kong.
In a week when Hong Kong’s universities became tear-gas-scented battlegrounds, the escalating violence has been matched by an intensifying spiral of rhetoric from the governments of Beijing and Hong Kong. Words have always been weapons in conflict, but in the social media age, their potential as tools of mobilization is exponentially multiplied, and the terminology used to describe protesters seems like a signal of tough action ahead.
Language has been key to this protest movement since its beginning. In June, Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, characterized a protest against a controversial extradition law as a “riot.” That designation — which echoed a pivotal moment in April 1989 when The People’s Daily, the main newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, called a mourning assembly by students in Tiananmen Square “turmoil” — was met with fury by protesters. They argued that the gathering had been calm until the police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. That anger helped swell the crowds of marchers to an estimated two million people four days later, with new demands including the retraction of the term “riot.”
For the first few months of the Hong Kong protests, China’s state media outlets seemed to be drawing upon the 1989-era playbook. They attributed the unrest to mysterious instigators whom they called “black hands,” and external hostile forces including the .
By August, state media had stepped up the rhetoric, describing the protesters as “violent mobs” and ” On Tuesday, a day after students lobbed Molotov cocktails and fired arrows at police officers who had trapped them inside Hong Kong Polytechnic University, China Daily, a state-run English-language newspaper, described Hong Kong’s campuses as             and warned of separatists “conspiring with foreign forces” to turn Hong Kong into a “bridgehead to subvert China.” Another article carried by the state mouthpiece described protesters’ demands for Western-style liberal democracy as a “malignant virus” and an            
Such comparisons reveal how seriously Beijing views the unrest in Hong Kong, which had long been one of the most stable places on China’s periphery. In a move that was part public relations exercise and part threat, People’s Liberation Army troops that are stationed in the city jogged out of their barracks last weekend to “voluntarily” clean the streets, bearing brooms and plastic buckets. It was only the second time since 1997 that they have been seen on Hong Kong’s streets, and it was not lost on Hong Kong’s residents that these soldiers were from the , a designation emblazoned on their colorful jerseys.
The mini-constitution that governs Hong Kong, the Basic Law, stipulates that troops can be called out to help with disaster relief if requested by the local government. In this case, no request had been made. Even if the troops remain in the barracks in the future, their presence has now been advertised, and this contributes to the perception of a militarization of Hong Kong’s streets, which nightly — and increasingly by day, too — teem with regular police officers, riot policemen and members of the elite “Raptor” unit, a specialized riot control task force.
To Chinese readers, mentions of separatism and terrorism invoke Xinjiang, the northwestern province where China is holding an estimated one million members of the Uighur minority in political indoctrination camps. The discourse of pathology is often used in relation to Xinjiang, where Islam is depicted as . One            , explaining: “The problems of Hong Kong and that of terrorism have similar causes: lack of realistic economic opportunities and misguided ideology. Regarding terrorism, China has shown the world a more effective and humane approach than that pursued by other countries.”
According to this logic, a “weakened immune system” is a vulnerability that can be healed only by the education of  but misguided youngsters, raising the chilling prospect of some form of Xinjiang-style ideological re-education in Hong Kong. However, an attempt seven years ago to introduce courses in “national and moral education” to Hong Kong failed after mass protests by students.
These disease metaphors underline Beijing’s view of Hong Kong’s protest movement as a threat to its body politic, with ideological infection posing an existential danger to the Chinese Communist Party. Such discourse could prefigure new restrictions on speech in Hong Kong, a possibility that seems to be inching incrementally closer. An injunction that has been introduced to protect Hong Kong police officers from “doxxing” — releasing their personal details online — has been criticized as overly broad, since it also prohibits “harassing, threatening, pestering or interfering” with the police. Such a law could even technically outlaw singing protest songs about the police. More worrying, one adviser to Hong Kong’s government has already  has not been ruled out.
As the arrests in Hong Kong mount, , the language from Ms. Lam, the unpopular chief executive, is hardening as well. In August, she lay the blame for the protests on a small minority with “            Two weeks ago, she denounced the            .” This phrase, alien in Hong Kong, comes straight from the Communist Party lexicon. Chairman Mao once decreed that “enemies of the people” do not actually belong to the category of people. They are, effectively, nonpeople.
The dehumanization of Hong Kong’s protesters has been underway for months. In July, when a pro-Beijing legislator, Junius Ho, complained that his parents’ graves had been defaced, a senior police officer, John Tse Chun-cheng, said the vandalism was done not by humans but by “cockroaches.” Since then, state media has carried cartoons depicting activists as cockroaches, which has become a term of abuse by the police. A week ago, video emerged on social media of police officers talking about “killing cockroaches.” This language — the rhetoric of genocide — carries an implicit threat for protesters.
The protesters’ language, too, has become much harsher; “dogs” and “triads” — a reference to Hong Kong’s feared criminal syndicates — are among the few printable epithets used against the police. Cantonese is famously sweary, and profane graffiti now spackles Hong Kong’s streets, including provocative terms like “,” a portmanteau comparing today’s China to Nazi Germany. 
As the protest movement has widened its focus — from one specific law to police brutality and Hong Kong’s own political future — its slogans, too, have changed. A subversive rallying call that was once considered a fringe idea has become a clarion call: “Retake Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times!” The phrase was coined by Edward Leung, a pro-independence politician who is serving a six-year jail sentence for his role in. Its meaning is ambiguous, but officials are publicly denouncing it as a challenge to national sovereignty.
But Beijing is not trying to counter the protesters slogan for slogan. Its strategy is much broader. Earlier this year, China , directed mainly at overseas Chinese and Hong Kongers, to frame the protests as a separatist plot aimed at undermining China’s territorial integrity. In October, having laid that groundwork for public support, Beijing said that it was planning a “            in Hong Kong, paired            . It’s unclear how severe those measures will be, but President Xi Jinping has warned that anyone attempting to split             The violence of his language leaves little space for compromise or compassion.

The New York Times ,2019-09-04,Hong Kong _s Leader Partly Relents. Will the Protests Continue_,917 ,"
HONG KONG — After nearly three months of protests that have rocked Hong Kong, the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, made a key concession on Wednesday in announcing her intention to formally withdraw a deeply unpopular extradition bill.
But experts say the move, which comes after a weekend of violent clashes between protesters and the police, is unlikely to fully quell the demonstrations. Since the demonstrations began in June, protesters’ demands have morphed into a broader movement calling for fundamental political reforms and an independent inquiry into police conduct.
Here is a look at Mrs. Lam’s action and its possible impact on a city roiled by protests.
What did Carrie Lam do?
In announcing her decision to withdraw a contentious bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, Mrs. Lam was trying to placate Hong Kongers concerned about being subject to China’s opaque legal system, which is controlled by the ruling Communist Party.
Mrs. Lam , not long after mass street protests erupted, that she was indefinitely delaying the bill. But many were unsatisfied with Mrs. Lam’s decision to suspend the proposal, rather than fully withdraw it. On June 16,             in a dramatic rejection of the government’s attempt to back down.
Protesters seized on Mrs. Lam’s refusal to formally withdraw the bill as a sign that she was more beholden to Beijing than to Hong Kong, a former British colony that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Mrs. Lam said on Wednesday that, in addition to formally withdrawing the bill, she would appoint two new members to a police review committee to investigate officers’ behavior during the protests. But protesters want an independent investigation of police conduct, and do not trust the existing committee, considering it ineffective.
What’s the difference between suspending a bill and withdrawing it?
The suspension removed the extradition bill from the agenda of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council. But under the council’s rules, a suspended bill could be restored with 12 days’ notice, meaning it could be reintroduced. Mrs. Lam’s announcement that she would withdraw the bill is far more consequential. Withdrawal means that the bill’s sponsors would have to start all over again if they want to reintroduce it.
What’s next for the protests?
Despite Mrs. Lam’s concession on the extradition bill, the demonstrations are likely to continue. After Mrs. Lam’s announcement on Wednesday, many protesters vowed in social messaging groups and online forums to continue taking to the streets, referring to the slogan: “Five demands, not one less.”
The protesters’ five demands are: the formal withdrawal of the extradition bill, the independent investigation into the police response, amnesty for arrested protesters, direct elections for all lawmakers and the chief executive, and not labeling those at a June 12 protest as “rioters.”
Though Mrs. Lam’s decision may help assuage some protesters, experts said it was unlikely to satisfy a small group of young demonstrators who have become more militant in recent weeks. A test of the public’s reaction to Mrs. Lam’s decision, they said, could come as soon as this weekend, since the biggest, most disruptive protests often happen on weekends.
In recent weeks, as clashes between protesters and the police have intensified, the focus of the demonstrations has shifted to police violence, and Mrs. Lam’s actions on Wednesday could be seen as falling short.
“It may ease anger a little, but it’s definitely not going to get people out of the streets,” said Samson Yuen, an assistant professor of political science at Lingnan University in Hong Kong who studies local social movements.
“It’s too late,” Mr. Yuen said. “The focus of the protests is not on the bill anymore.”
How is Beijing likely to react?
Though Mrs. Lam announced the decision to withdraw the bill, many saw it as a concession by Beijing. Mrs. Lam recently told a group of businesspeople that she would resign if she could but had no choice in the matter, . Many took it as further proof that Beijing was calling the shots.
The announcement comes just weeks before China is to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic. While many saw Mrs. Lam’s move as an effort to soothe public anger before that important event, some experts expressed doubt that Beijing would allow any further concessions, especially with regards to the police.
Short of China sending in troops, the Hong Kong police “are the only forceful means they can use to control the situation,” said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Center for China Studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “Beijing needs the police.”
What are other likely effects?
Financial markets reacted positively as reports of Mrs. Lam’s impending announcement began to circulate on Wednesday. By the end of the day, the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong had risen by nearly 4 percent, its biggest single-day gain since November.
But such optimism may be short-lived. The city’s economy has showed signs that it’s headed toward a recession. Should the protests continue, tourists might stay away and further damage the city’s retail sector and its small businesses, which have been badly battered by the demonstrations.

The Hong Kong protest movement reached a milestone on Tuesday: It was 80 days since the  that started the near-daily demonstrations across the city.
That means the protest campaign has lasted longer than the 2014 , during which demonstrators occupied roads in Hong Kong to call for greater democracy.
And even in the face of hostility from officials in Hong Kong and Beijing alike, and threats of intervention by the Chinese military, the protesters this time show no sign of stopping.
Hong Kongers took to the streets on June 9 over a proposed law allowing extraditions to mainland China. Their demands grew, including one for expanded direct elections. They also want an investigation into the use of force by the police, and amnesty for arrested protesters.
It has become the biggest political crisis in Hong Kong since Britain returned its onetime colony to Chinese control in 1997.
Many protesters have voiced their discontent peacefully: in processions of hundreds of thousands of people, in ads in international newspapers, and on so-called Lennon Walls filled with handwritten notes.
But protesters have also been confrontational, occupying the airport and a mall, obstructing roads and trains and clashing violently with the police.

Here are some of his most powerful images from the past 80 days.
June
Organizers said more than a million people joined the first march, or nearly one in every seven people in Hong Kong.
When the government refused to back down on the extradition bill, protesters came out again on June 12 and . The police fired tear gas canisters — the first of many; by one count more than 1,800 would be fired by early August.
Three days later, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, announced that , but not withdrawn. That did little to stop the public furor. The next day, protesters marched again. Organizers            . 
July
July 1 marked  of Hong Kong’s return to China.
The date has been one of protest for more than a decade, but this year the display of dissent culminated in one of the more remarkable moments of the summer: , where they painted slogans on walls and defaced symbols of Chinese authority.

Then on July 21, hours after protesters vandalized the Chinese government’s liaison office in the city, a mob attacked a group of protesters in a train station. The appearance of police inaction on that night has fueled widespread criticism of the Hong Kong force.
August
Three days of civil disobedience culminated in a call for a general strike on Aug. 5 — perhaps the . Trains were blocked and hundreds of flights were canceled after thousands of civil aviation employees stayed home.
At several locations across the city, police officers fired tear gas during protests. 
A week later, protesters returned to the airport, where days of sit-ins led to the cancellation of hundreds more flights.
Protesters , violence that was broadcast live by the local news media,            . It was followed by nearly two weeks of relative calm, though protests did continue, including            .
In Shenzhen, a mainland city near Hong Kong, paramilitary police officers drilled in a show of force. Last weekend, clashes began anew, with two days of tear gas. On Sunday, , a warning after a colleague fell as a group of protesters charged them with sticks and metal bars.
Another march is planned for the end of the month. For now, the cycle of protest appears set to continue.

Many of the protests that began rocking Hong Kong in June have been peaceful. But as the summer progressed, violent clashes with the police recurred, this one in Kowloon Bay. Day 1: Hundreds of thousands of people, one in seven Hong Kongers by one estimate, took to the streets on June 9 to protest a proposed extradition law. Three days later, the police clashed with demonstrators. Protesters expressed dismay at the decision of the officers to fire tear gas at them. Toward the end of the month, Hong Kongers decided to take their anger right to its target. They protested near police headquarters on June 21. In a turning point for the movement, protesters stormed the legislature on July 1. It was the 22nd anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to China. Some of the protesters occupied the legislature after storming the building, vandalizing the interior, and setting off divisions within the movement. The protesters found themselves the targets when a mob of government supporters, some carrying poles, set upon them at a train station. By early August, the police would fire an estimated 1,800 tear gas canisters, including what were said to be hundreds on this day alone in Wong Tai Sin. Much of the protest was driven by the young. This Aug. 22 rally in the Central neighborhood was attended by secondary school students. Violence broke out again at the most recent protests. On Sunday, police officers brandished weapons, and one fired a warning shot."

HONG KONG — The , leaderless but well coordinated, took a destructive turn on Monday, complicating what had been a mostly cohesive movement.
Scenes of  shattering glass to break into the Legislative Council building, followed by demonstrators scrawling graffiti on the walls inside and damaging furniture, caused some residents to question some of the tactics used. But many protesters defended the escalation by saying nothing else has worked, and that they were left with no choice if their demands — including the full withdrawal of a despised extradition bill — were to be met.
The resolution to the growing conflict could affect  standing as an international business hub and its status as a foothold of democracy in            . Hong Kong is a semiautonomous Chinese territory with its own system of government separate from the mainland, which has mostly watched the unrest at arm’s length.
Here are the main takeaways from the recent protests, and a look at why they took a destructive turn on Monday."
The New York Times ,2019-10-20,Hong Kong Police Fire Tear Gas as Protesters Defy Ban,1285 ,"
The Sunday demonstration, which followed 20 weeks of antigovernment protests, is a test of the movement’s strength amid increasing violence
HONG KONG — Police banned the march. Two of its promoters were attacked. 
Still, crowds of black-clad  filled the streets of             on Sunday in a display of continuing support for             despite increasing restrictions from the authorities. The march, which passed some of the most prominent centers of Hong Kong’s South Asian community, also featured a call for solidarity with the city’s ethnic minorities.
The demonstration began peacefully, eventually punctuated by outbursts of vandalism to shops, bank branches and subway stations. In a reprise of the , protesters threw firebombs at the police and officers fired multiple rounds of tear gas at demonstrators. 
And there were hints of possible escalations in violence. The police used a robot to dispose of a suspected homemade bomb on a street in the Prince Edward neighborhood. It was not immediately clear what danger, if any, the object posed. 
One week ago, the , a first for the protests. The explosive device, which was set off by a mobile phone, did not harm anyone.
Demonstrators started in Tsim Sha Tsui, a crowded commercial district on the southern tip of the Kowloon Peninsula. They assembled along a promenade beside Victoria Harbor and chanted slogans while the protest anthem “Glory to Hong Kong” was played. 
The Hong Kong subway system, which has sustained widespread vandalism from protesters in recent weeks, closed stations near the march’s route. Protesters broke windows in several stations on Sunday and painted graffiti over the protective barriers installed around the entryways. Branches of Chinese-owned banks and  were also damaged. 
The Civil Human Rights Front, the organizer of large,  it estimated were attended by            , applied to host the event Sunday. But the police rejected the application, saying that such demonstrations have often been hijacked by vandalism and violence.
After the ban, the group backed out of hosting the march, but one of its leaders, Figo Chan, and other pro-democracy figures called on people to turn out anyway.
“I’m not afraid of arrest, of jail, of getting beaten up or gashed,” Mr. Chan said Sunday before the march. “But I hope people understand that to fight for democracy, freedom and justice, we must sacrifice. We use peaceful, rational and nonviolent means to express our demands. We are not afraid of arrest. What I fear most is everyone giving up on our principles.”
Another Civil Human Rights Front leader, Jimmy Sham, was attacked by men with hammers on Tuesday in Kowloon. Mr. Sham was released from a hospital, but was continuing to receive treatment and not able to attend the march, the group said.
That attack led to expressions of support for Hong Kong’s ethnic minority communities during the protest Sunday. Some unconfirmed reports said Mr. Sham’s attackers were paid South Asian men, and people in the protest movement said they were worried that could lead to retaliatory attacks.
Some demonstrators on Sunday stood outside the Kowloon Mosque and Islamic Center with signs calling on others to respect the building. “Be nice to religion,” one sign read. 
As the police water cannon moved past the mosque,  that officers sprayed at protesters holding signs outside.
“What can we say?” said Yaz Bhutta, a 28-year-old salesman, throwing his hands in exasperation after seeing the stained steps. “The police are crazy people, spraying chemicals at our mosque. This is where we come and worship every day.”
Picking up a broom, he brushed streams of the blue liquid into drains.
The police , and contacted the chief imam and Muslim community leaders to explain and express concern.
At Chungking Mansions, a building in Tsim Sha Tsui that holds several South Asian-run restaurants and shops, volunteers handed out bottled water to demonstrators.
Kamil Kaka, who is from southern India and has lived in Hong Kong for more than a decade, said he was a little worried that protesters could target South Asians like him.
But Mr. Kaka, 32, said he thought Hong Kong people should have a right to protest, as he stood on a side street in Tsim Sha Tsui, watching demonstrators stream down the district’s main thoroughfare. 
“People are fighting for their freedom,” Mr. Kaka said. 
After the attack on Mr. Sham, another protest supporter was seriously injured in an assault on Saturday evening. A 19-year-old man was stabbed in the neck and abdomen near a subway station in northern Hong Kong as he distributed fliers calling on people to join the march. He is hospitalized in serious condition, the government said.
A 22-year-old man was arrested in the attack.  who said the attacker had shouted that Hong Kong was a part of China, and that protesters were damaging the city.
Chinese officials and the state news media have denounced the protests as a separatist movement. Some Hong Kong marchers carried Catalan flags on Sunday to show solidarity with . Although some protesters have called for Hong Kong’s independence from China, it is not a focus of the Hong Kong demonstrators or one of their official demands.
The protests began over legislation, since withdrawn, that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China from Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s top leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, , but public anger with the authorities has remained high.
The marchers on Sunday reiterated other longstanding demands, including an independent investigation of the police, amnesty for arrested protesters and the introduction of direct elections for the chief executive and the entire legislature. 
The organizers have also raised two newer demands: a reorganization of the police department and the scrapping of a ban on face masks.
Mrs. Lam . The move set off a wave of fresh protests and clashes with the police.
“I want to make the best use of every chance to come out,” said Anne Chin, 32, a clerk who joined the march. “After the mask ban, we don’t know when the government will invoke the Emergency Regulations Ordinance again and implement laws that may further muzzle Hong Kong people’s rights.”
Mr. Chan said at least 350,000 people participated in the protest.
Protesters said they were determined to show that the movement still had wide support, even if the attendance had been dampened by police bans and recent attacks. Jason Wong, a 26-year-old office worker, brought to the march 60-foot-long black banners signed by residents in each of the city’s 18 districts with colorful markers, an effort aided by a team of volunteers. 
“The government has posed many restrictions and tried to oppress the Hong Kong people, but we cannot show weakness,” he said. “We need to show the world that we have many people calling for common demands, even if not everyone dares to come out.”

The New York Times,2019-10-05,Eerie Quiet Settles on Hong Kong as Face Mask Ban Takes Effect,727 ,"
HONG KONG -- Hong Kong residents were recovering on Saturday from street clashes, arson and vandalism that threw the city into chaos a night earlier, and bracing for the prospect of further unrest as a contentious ban on face masks took effect.
As many Hong Kongers awoke on Saturday morning to find the windows of their neighborhood stores and subway stations smashed by pro-democracy protesters, much of the city -- including its entire subway system -- was shuttered. 
  And as tourists anxiously raced to Hong Kong's airport on Saturday afternoon, the streets of the normally bustling financial hub were cloaked in eerie silence, along with concern about how much further the clashes might escalate.
  The semiautonomous Chinese city has been in a political crisis since June, and street clashes between antigovernment protesters and the police have steadily grown more combative and dangerous.
  In the latest sign of rising danger, a 14-year-old boy was hit in the leg by a gunshot on Friday. His condition was later changed from serious to stable.
  The police said separately that one of its plainclothes officers had fired a shot in self-defense on Friday. But as of Saturday afternoon, it was unclear whether the officer had in fact shot the boy, as many protesters assumed.
  Now the face mask ban, which took effect at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, threatens to inflame tensions further still.
  Hong Kong's embattled leader, Carrie Lam, announced the ban on Friday, saying her government had a duty to ''stop the escalating violence and restore calmness in society.''
  Mrs. Lam's government apparently hopes that invoking its emergency powers to enact the ban -- which is punishable by fines and jail time -- will dampen turnout at pro-democracy street demonstrations where protesters typically wear masks to hide their identities and guard against tear gas.
  But Mrs. Lam's announcement on Friday set off an especially violent wave of protests across the city, as protesters smashed windows and set fires at subway stations and at stores they perceived to be pro-government.
  Friday's violence and chaos prompted the authorities to shut down the entire subway system two hours earlier than normal. That the system was still closed as of early Saturday afternoon marked an exceedingly rare development in a global financial hub known for its efficient public transportation.
  Many businesses were also closed across the city on Saturday, including several major malls and all but one branch of Bank of China. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said that some bank branches had closed on account of vandalism and arson, and the police warned the public in a text message that ''unauthorized public events expected in coming days may cause severe disruptions.''
  Some protesters were planning to defy the new ban by gathering with masks in the streets over the weekend, although their exact plans were unclear as of early Saturday afternoon.
  ''The ban is not addressing the problem; it's trying to get rid of the people who are trying to speak out about it,'' said Castor Lau, 29, a protester who joined a protest on Friday in the Causeway Bay shopping district. ''But Hong Kongers won't be deterred from protests. We can't let oppression govern our behavior.''
  On Friday, Mrs. Lam said she was acting under a rarely used provision in the territory's colonial-era law that allows the issuance of regulations in response to ''a state of serious danger.'' She emphasized repeatedly at a news conference that she was not declaring an emergency.
  But by any measure, her decision to invoke the so-called Emergency Regulations Ordinance is rare and unusual. The law was last used during the pro-Communist riots that broke out in British-ruled Hong Kong in 1967, leaving more than 50 people dead.
  So far, no one has died on the streets since the protests started in early June. But some have come close, and flashing ambulance sirens have become a common sight on the fringes of street clashes between protesters and police officers in riot gear.
  During a violent round of protests across the city on Tuesday, a protester was shot by a police officer for the first time since the protests began and was rushed to a hospital in critical condition. His condition later stabilized after emergency surgery.

The New York Times ,2019-09-02,Riot Police Officers Spread Across Hong Kong in Wake of Violence,1410 ,"
HONG KONG — A senior Hong Kong official on Monday warned for the first time that “elements of terror” were seen among the city’s pro-democracy protesters, as riot police officers took up positions around schools and spread out across Hong Kong’s subway system after a weekend of demonstrations punctuated by violence and vandalism.
The Hong Kong authorities  description of “signs of terrorism” in characterizing acts of violence by some protesters. But John Lee, the territory’s secretary for security, changed that stance on Monday, as the local government escalated its criticism of the monthslong demonstrations.
“The extent of violence, danger and destruction have reached very serious conditions,” Mr. Lee said. “Radical people have escalated their violent and illegal acts, showing elements of terror.”
Mr. Lee cited increasing violence but offered little further explanation of how officials decided to employ the word “terror.”
His comments followed a weekend of intense protest. Tens of thousands of people defied a police ban and marched through several central neighborhoods on Saturday. Some clashed with riot police officers near the government headquarters, hurling rocks and bricks as officers responded with tear gas, pepper spray and water cannon.
The police said protesters threw as many as 100 firebombs over the weekend, and displayed one they seized — made from a Corona Extra beer bottle — at a news conference.
Monday was the start of the school year for many students in Hong Kong. Young people made up one of the largest groups of protesters in recent months, and their activism was likely to continue on campus, with strikes and demonstrations planned."
The New York Times,2019-10-06,"Amid Mask Ban and Closed Subway, Night of Protest Gives Way to Eerie Quiet",1317 ,"
After a night of arson and vandalism, the financial hub braces for more unrest and ponders the future with anxiety.
HONG KONG -- With its subways paralyzed and its shopping malls shuttered, Hong Kong was anxious and eerily quiet on Saturday.  
  The city was taking a breather from a night of unrest that erupted after Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, invoked emergency powers to quell antigovernment protests that have grown increasingly violent. 
  The unexpected tranquillity masked a palpable sense of anger and dread that has swept the city since Mrs. Lam announced on Friday that she would draw on a colonial-era law to ban face masks during street rallies. 
  The government's decision was ostensibly designed to dissuade moderate Hong Kongers from joining the demonstrations roiling this semiautonomous Chinese territory. But the turn to emergency powers that allow Mrs. Lam to pass rules without having to go through the legislature immediately unleashed some of the most violent protests the city has seen in recent months. 
  The clashes raised the prospect that the unrest might further escalate in the coming days, testing the limits of the territory's already strained economy and the patience of the ruling Communist Party in China.
  On a deeper level, the move has triggered concerns that the government would take further steps to erode the civil liberties that have long differentiated Hong Kong from the rest of China and helped turn the city into an international trade and finance powerhouse. The government hopes the ban will deter the protesters from resorting to violence, but to many it represents a turning point that could fundamentally change the city's identity and would only inflame tensions more.
  ''How can we move on when there are such intense and deep-rooted divisions within our society?'' said Wendy Ng, a 44-year-old part-time cooking instructor who was staying home on Saturday because the authorities had shut down the subway network. ''The mask ban is making it worse, can't they see?'' 
  ''If the government does not make further concessions,'' she added, ''it's over for this city, both for us and for those government officials who think of themselves as all-powerful.''
  The ban announced Friday targets the face masks that protesters use to conceal their identities, but Mrs. Lam could, if she deemed necessary later, use the emergency powers to impose a curfew or empower the police to search phones more easily without warrants, among other measures. 
  Many in the protest movement see the move against face masks as a de facto ban on their right to protest and believe it would antagonize those already enraged by the leadership's refusal to grant them the free elections and other demands they have been pressing since the protests began in June. 
  ''It will only make people more furious with the government,'' said Lam Cheuk-ting, a pro-democracy lawmaker in Hong Kong's legislative body. The ban, he said, would have little impact on the growing number of young protesters willing -- and often eager -- to confront the armed riot police. 
  ''I fear that Hong Kong's situation will only go from bad to worse,'' he said.
  On Saturday afternoon, several hundred demonstrators gathered in central Hong Kong, but most of the city was calm as people remained close to home and an earlier call for mass gatherings evaporated when it became apparent that moving about the city would be difficult. 
  Nearly all of the city's subway lines have been closed since Friday evening after the protesters smashed windows and set fires at subway stations. Transit officials blamed the move on the need to repair damage by vandals but it was seen by some as at least in part aimed at heading off large protests. 
  Like many of those who marched through the streets of the city's Wan Chai neighborhood on Saturday, Clare Fok, 43, a cosmetics sales clerk, made a point of concealing her face. 
  ''I've never worn masks to marches before because they're stuffy and I'm beautiful,'' Ms. Fok said cheekily through a swatch of gray fabric, a pair of aviator sunglasses hiding her eyes. ''We are deliberately wearing masks today because we can't accept the ban. They're taking away our freedoms, and we won't just obey because they tell us to.''
  In a televised speech Saturday, Mrs. Lam condemned the protesters who rampaged through neighborhoods across the city on Friday night, destroying traffic lights, spray-painting ATMs and damaging state-owned Chinese businesses -- or those whose owners are widely seen as hostile to the protest movement. 
  The violence and destruction, she said, only reinforced her decision to invoke the emergency ordinance. 
  ''The extreme acts of the rioters brought dark hours to Hong Kong last night and half paralyzed society today,'' she said grimly. ''Everyone is worried, anxious and even in fear.''
  The face-mask ban, which went into effect early Saturday, carries a maximum jail sentence of one year and a $3,200 fine. So far, the police appear to have largely taken a hands-off approach to those defying the measure. 
  Samson Yuen, a political scientist at Lingnan University, said he thought the measure would be counterproductive. 
  ''The government has turned the simple face mask into a protest symbol,'' he said. ''By using the emergency laws, they are pouring fuel on the fire.'' 
  The protests began four months ago in opposition to a now-abandoned bill that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to the mainland, but they have steadily grown more combative and dangerous. On Friday night, a 14-year-old boy was hit in the leg by a gunshot. The police said Saturday that the teenager, who was in stable condition, had been arrested for rioting and assaulting police officers. 
  Earlier in the week, a police officer shot and critically wounded an 18-year-old student who had charged at him. It was the first time the police used live fire to subdue a protester. 
  The shooting added to the sense of urgency among Hong Kong's leaders, prompting them to embrace the contentious face-mask ban.
  Nearly everyone in this city of seven million was affected by the transit shutdown that has marred what is a three-day holiday weekend. Many shops, banks and restaurants were also closed, and nearly all the city's ubiquitous 7-Eleven convenience stores pulled down their gates at 5 p.m. When the city's high-speed train to the airport was briefly suspended, anxious tourists scrambled to find scarce taxis and Ubers.
  Some blamed the protesters themselves for the inconveniences. 
  Joining a crush of hundreds awaiting buses, Sarah Wong, who works in sales, said she was generally sympathetic to the protesters' demands but was upset by their use of vandalism and violence. 
  ''They can ask for freedom, but they shouldn't inconvenience other people,'' said Ms. Wong, who complained about being forced to cancel an appointment with her hair dresser.
  With more protests scheduled for Sunday, the sense of foreboding was inescapable across much of the city. 
  In Statue Square, a plaza in the historic heart of Hong Kong, Alice Ng, 31, joined other masked protesters who laughed and cheered as a man climbed on a bronze figure of Sir Thomas Jackson, a 19th-century British banker, and covered his head with one of the plastic helmets that have become indispensable for those who audaciously confront the police and their tear-gas canisters. 
  A few minutes later, the mood changed when riot police officers charged into the plaza, briefly detained two people who wore masks and searched their backpacks. They also took a man who was wearing a bandanna over his face to a police vehicle.
  ''Daytime protests are peaceful,'' Ms. Ng, an interior designer, said as the sun began to set. ''But at night, it's a different story.''

The New York Times,2019-07-15,Rallies Keep Up Political Pressure in Hong Kong,1234 ,"
HONG KONG -- Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday in a peaceful rally that descended into clashes inside a shopping mall as the police tried to clear out a small group of younger demonstrators.
The march was the protesters' latest effort to spread their movement across the semiautonomous Chinese region and the first major test of public sentiment since the city's embattled leader announced that an unpopular bill was ''dead'' but stopped short of withdrawing it. 
  Dark rain clouds loomed as the large mass of protesters marched through the Sha Tin area of the New Territories, a region of Hong Kong near the border with mainland China, and shouted slogans like ''The police knowingly broke the law'' and ''Fight on, Hong Kong.''
  In the late afternoon, scuffles broke out as police officers wielding shields and batons deployed pepper spray against a small group of protesters, some of whom pelted the officers with plastic bottles and traffic cones.
  As night fell, a tense standoff formed between protesters and police officers in riot gear. Around 7 p.m., a pro-democracy lawmaker, Ted Hui, and several local officials from Sha Tin sat cross-legged in the middle of the road between the officers and the protesters and demanded to speak with the police commander.
  [A New York Times visual investigation suggests the police used excessive force in handling a previous protest.]
  By 10 p.m., as the police tried to clear the streets in the mostly residential neighborhood, the demonstrators had scattered and many ended up regrouping in a shopping mall. Soon after, the police moved into the mall and were met with protesters who had filled the floors overlooking the atrium and were throwing bottles and umbrellas at the officers on the ground floor.
  The police struck at the protesters with batons and pushed them with shields, and officers were seen dragging several of them away. Local television footage showed some protesters surrounding and kicking a police officer who appeared to be on the ground. Other protesters were being treated by medics.
  According to the Hong Kong Hospital Authority, 28 people were admitted to hospitals on Sunday for injuries. By Monday morning, eight people had been discharged and two remained in critical condition.
  The police said 10 officers had been injured in the clashes. One officer had part of a finger bitten off by a protester after he gouged the man's eye with it.
  The Hong Kong government said it condemned the actions of those protesters who blocked roads, assaulted police officers and disrupted the peace. ''The rule of law is the cornerstone of Hong Kong, and the society will absolutely not tolerate such violent acts,'' it said in a statement late Sunday.
  Several pro-democracy lawmakers criticized the police's handling of the demonstration, saying that officers who stormed into the mall in full riot gear had set off panic among the protesters.
  The demonstration in Sha Tin came one day after clashes broke out between police officers and protesters in a Hong Kong border town.
  The protest on Saturday concerned so-called parallel traders, who come across the border from the mainland to buy items like baby formula and diapers for resale in China -- hurting consumers in Hong Kong, critics of the practice say. Two protesters were arrested, including on charges of unlawful assembly.
  On Sunday morning, before the demonstration in Sha Tin began, hundreds of people also participated in a silent march organized by several local journalism associations in the city's financial district to protest what they say was the excessive use of force by police officers against members of the news media during previous demonstrations.
  Hong Kong has been rocked by a wave of mass demonstrations since early June amid a public uproar over a piece of legislation that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Though Carrie Lam, the city's chief executive, suspended the bill, she has refused to formally retract it.
  It the biggest political crisis in the former British colony since it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
  The complete withdrawal of the extradition bill is one of the protesters' five main demands. They are also seeking universal suffrage, the retraction of the government's characterization of a protest on June 12 as a ''riot,'' the unconditional release of all protesters arrested, and an independent inquiry into police violence against protesters.
  But Mrs. Lam has shown little willingness to meet the protesters' demands, and both sides now appear to be dug in for what many expect will be a summer of unrest in the city.
  ''This has become an issue of political structure,'' said Ivan Choy, a senior lecturer in government at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
  ''The younger people cannot find a way to change the political situation of Hong Kong and master their own future,'' Mr. Choy said. ''So they have to come out and go to the streets or use even more confrontational methods to force the government to pay more attention to their opinion.''
  Protesters on Sunday added two local issues to the five main demands, calling for an end to the politically motivated disqualification of candidates for elected office and more open discussion of the extradition bill at the district level.
  But they differed as to their top priorities.
  Horus Leung and Matthew Lee, both university students, said they were most concerned about the rough treatment of protesters by the police.
  ''The police used to serve the citizens, but now they've become a political tool in oppressing protesters' voices,'' said Mr. Leung, 18. ''They are no longer neutral.''
  Mr. Lee said that while he was tired after attending a number of protests in recent weeks, it was imperative to keep the momentum going.
  ''If we don't stand up now, we won't have a chance later,'' he said. ''We have no choice -- this is our home and there's nowhere else for us to go.''
  Others said they would not be satisfied until all of the protesters' demands were met.
  ''Not one of our five demands can be missing,'' said Ip Chuen-mui, 64, a house cleaner and longtime resident of Sha Tin, ''or else we will keep coming out.''
  The march in Sha Tin on Sunday was the latest attempt by protesters to get out their message and sustain momentum for the movement.
  Last week, tens of thousands of protesters turned out for a demonstration in Kowloon, a region of Hong Kong across the harbor from the financial district where most of the protests took place last month. It was the first major action after the dramatic storming of the city's legislative building by a small group of protesters this month.
  Unlike the pro-democracy protests that swept through Hong Kong in 2014, the recent demonstrations have been notable for their largely leaderless nature. Many of the recent marches and gatherings have been organized through online forums and the Telegram messaging app.
  The movement has also adopted decidedly low-tech messaging strategies in the form of thousands of colorful sticky notes, most expressing support for the protesters and their demands. So-called Lennon Walls, named after a memorial in Prague dedicated to the singer John Lennon, have been popping up around the city over the last few weeks.
  In recent days, however, scuffles have broken out when some people tried to rip down the displays."

HONG KONG -- Protesters held another march in Hong Kong on Sunday, the first major action since a small group of demonstrators broke into the city's legislature last Monday in a dramatic escalation of recent tensions.
It was the latest in a series of protests that have roiled Hong Kong since the city's leaders tried to push through a contentious bill that would allow extradition to mainland China. The protests, which organizers say have drawn up to two million people, have been mostly peaceful, apart from a few violent confrontations between police officers and demonstrators. 
  Organizers said about 230,000 turned out for Sunday's protests. The police said the turnout was 56,000 at its peak.
  Tensions culminated last week when an offshoot group of young protesters smashed their way into a legislative building and ransacked the premises, as hundreds of thousands of people marched peacefully in a concurrent protest elsewhere in the city.
  Late Sunday night, the police and dozens of protesters clashed in the Mong Kok District a couple of hours after the march nearby had ended, leading to five arrests. The demonstrators sought to occupy a major road, but the police declared it an unlawful assembly and began warning protesters to leave. Officers with batons, shields and helmets then began clearing out the crowd. At least one man was seen being taken away by the police.
  Though the extradition bill has been suspended, the protesters' demands have broadened to include a call for more democratic reforms such as universal suffrage, in addition to a full withdrawal of the bill, an independent inquiry into police violence toward protesters and amnesty for the protesters.
  [Here's what to know about Hong Kong's evolving protest movement.]
  Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory, has a separate political and judicial system and is governed based on a principle known as ''one country, two systems.'' But in recent years, as Beijing has grown more autocratic and increased efforts to integrate Hong Kong with the mainland, many here have become alarmed about the erosion of the city's once-robust protections for civic freedoms and rule of law.
  While previous marches have been held in the downtown financial and business districts of Hong Kong Island, the march on Sunday is the first to take place in Kowloon, an area of Hong Kong that is attached to the Chinese mainland. It is being billed as an opportunity to engage with mainland Chinese in the hope that they will back the protesters.
  The Hong Kong protests have been heavily censored in the mainland, where they are portrayed by government officials and the state news media as being organized by ''foreign forces'' and spearheaded by violent ''extreme radicals.''
  Josie Kwok, 18, said she saw the protest on Sunday as an opportunity to reset the tone following the clashes last week.
  ''I think the most important thing today is for the protests to be peaceful,'' she said. ''We want to show mainlanders that Hong Kong isn't China, and we want to show other Hong Kongers and the world that we are peaceful so we can gain their support.''
  The march began in the late afternoon in Tsim Sha Tsui, a shopping area popular with mainland Chinese tourists, and ended at the West Kowloon railway station, which is the terminus of a high-speed line to the Chinese city of Guangzhou. In addition to the five arrested during the nighttime clashes, another person was arrested during the protest for failing to produce identification.
  Mainland tourists, many carrying shopping bags, watched and took photographs as the protesters marched past designer stores.
  Sunny Yang, 37, a mainlander who has lived in Hong Kong for nine years, said she had always felt somewhat ''awkward'' about the protests, which have at times taken on an anti-China tone. But seeing the scale and largely peaceful nature of the protests this time around, she said, left her feeling quite ''positive.''
  ''It doesn't really affect us, but it's a very big issue for these young people,'' she said as she gestured toward the protesters. ''I think the local government should really listen to the people.''
  Liu Xiao, 28, came to Hong Kong from Chongqing with friends to do some shopping. She had heard about the protests but said she thought the extradition bill was ''justifiable.''
  ''If people have committed crimes, they shouldn't be allowed to dodge the law,'' she said.
  Opponents of the bill fear that it could be used to send political dissidents for trial in mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party.
  Seeing the protest on Sunday was ''shocking'' for Liu Li, 22, who runs a small baking company in the southern Chinese city of Jiujiang and was visiting Hong Kong for the first time.
  ''We would never be allowed to do something like this in the mainland,'' she said. ''Even if 100 people gather together, they would get detained.''
  The opening of the West Kowloon station last year has raised fears about growing mainland influence in Hong Kong. Mainland customs and immigration officials are stationed inside the railway terminus and parts of the station are subject to mainland jurisdiction, which has prompted some pro-democracy advocates and scholars to call it a ''Trojan train.''
  Law enforcement officials had been bracing for a large turnout and possible clashes with mainland visitors. The police shut down some roads and put up large plastic barricades around West Kowloon station. All but one of the entrances and exits to the station were closed. Sales for tickets departing from the station also ended midday.
  Timothy Chui, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, said that some mainland tour groups decided to avoid the Tsim Sha Tsui area on Sunday because of the planned march.
  By Sunday evening around 9, the official protest had dissipated. A small group of mostly masked demonstrators stayed behind at the rail terminus, jeering at the police officers, who stood behind the barricades.
  While the turnout for Sunday's protests exceeded organizers' expectations, it was significantly smaller in scale than the demonstrations in previous weeks. But many protesters said they were determined to keep going. Another demonstration was announced for next weekend.
  ''I have participated in all of the protests already,'' said Alex Leung, 57, a construction worker. ''And I will continue to participate until this Hong Kong government responds to us and fulfills our demands.''

The New York Times ,2019-08-26,"In Hong Kong , Protest Photo Evokes Memories of Tiananmen Era",603 ,"
A New York Times photographer captured an image of an unarmed protester peacefully confronting a Hong Kong police officer. For many, it has brought back memories of 1989.
One man wore a white shirt and black trousers, and carried two shopping bags. He stared down a tank.
The other wore shorts and a tank top, and carried a furled umbrella. He stared down a police officer who had a weapon drawn.
The two photos are drawing comparisons as compelling images of outmatched citizens standing up to Chinese authority.
The first photo was taken in Beijing in 1989 , which were brutally quashed by the government. The protester, who quickly became known as Tank Man, captured the world’s attention. And the iconic photo has endured 30 years after the Tiananmen crackdown.
The second was taken on Sunday in Hong Kong by a photographer for The New York Times, Lam Yik Fei, as the local police clashed again with protesters in the semiautonomous Chinese territory. The photograph of the protests, now in their third month, has resonated on social media and been shared thousands of times. To many people, the image evokes memories of Tiananmen. 
Mr. Lam is one of the few photographers for a Western news outlet who has been covering the protests in Hong Kong from the beginning. He was there when protesters stormed the airport and the train stations, and when they were.
David Furst, The Times’s international picture editor, said Mr. Lam has deep sources among the protesters, and has followed their movements closely. That shows, he said, in the comprehensive nature of his coverage.
On Sunday, Mr. Lam said, he was just trying to to stay on top of events.
Violence had broken out after a peaceful march, where many protesters carried umbrellas, a symbol of the resistance movement. Hong Kong police officers who were charging them with sticks, and one officer fired a warning shot into the air after another officer fell.
As Mr. Lam looked on, the protester in shorts and a tank top approached one officer and dropped to his knees.
“He said, ‘Don’t shoot,’” the photographer said.
The officer did not shoot — but did kick the man in the torso, knocking him over.
The photograph Mr. Lam took was made a moment later, after the protester stood back up and backed away, umbrella in hand.
Mak Chin-ho, the assistant commissioner for police operations, said the officers on the scene “demonstrated great restraint,” calling their response necessary and reasonable during a volatile situation in which their lives “were in great danger.” 
“During that critical moment, this man suddenly appeared in front,” he said, referring specifically to the episode in which the officer pointed his weapon at the man with the umbrella. “Understandably, he appeared as a threat.”
No one knows what happened to  in 1989. Even his name has remained a mystery, at least to the general public. Some believe that he must have been executed, others that he might have been spared.
The name of the Hong Kong protester is not known, either. But it appears he is still safe. Mr. Lam saw him slip away after the crowd dispersed.
Mr. Lam, a 33-year-old Hong Kong native, said he has photographed worse conflicts elsewhere. But it feels different when it is in one’s own home. 
“I covered protests in other countries before,” he said, “but I never imagined it would happen in Hong Kong.”

The New York Times ,2019-09-29,Major Clashes Erupt in Hong Kong Ahead of China_s National Day,1044 ,"
HONG KONG — Three of Hong Kong’s main commercial districts were engulfed in thick clouds of tear gas on Sunday as pro-democracy demonstrators battled the police in an open challenge to Beijing just two days before .
Sunday’s demonstrations were some of the worst unrest in the city since the protest movement began in early June and were timed ahead of China’s National Day anniversary on Tuesday. The protesters see the anniversary as a chance to broadcast their  in their semiautonomous Chinese city.
The local authorities, however, are under pressure to tamp down anything that could overshadow China’s official celebrations.
[Here is how China is preparing to  on National Day.]
The protests began early Sunday afternoon in the Causeway Bay shopping district and quickly turned violent, as demonstrators smashed the windows of a subway station in nearby Wan Chai and threw flaming bottles into it.
They also set fire to a decorative red sign that celebrated National Day and directed much of their taunting and chanting at the central Chinese government and the Communist Party. Some papered “Anti-ChiNazi” signs on the gates of businesses that they perceived to be pro-Beijing, including Chinese banks.
“Expel the Communist Party, free Hong Kong,” the crowd chanted at one point.
Jason To, 18, a university student who joined a march toward government offices, said he was afraid that if Hong Kong drew closer to mainland China, the city’s residents would lose their right to protest and their free press.
“I’m a Hong Konger, not a mainland Chinese.” Mr. To said, speaking through a gas mask. “All of us like China, but we don’t like the Communist Party. Their rule is problematic.”
By nightfall, the police had sprayed clouds of tear gas in three busy districts on Hong Kong’s main island and arcs of blue-dyed water from cannons mounted on trucks. Battalions of riot police officers were patrolling the streets of major commercial districts as if they were battlefields, and protesters were setting fires at intersections and the entrances to shuttered subway stations.
In the luxury Admiralty shopping district, the police sprayed blue-dyed water at protesters outside the Hong Kong headquarters of the Chinese military. They also pinned protesters to the ground, including one who was bleeding profusely from his skull, near a line of police vans and buses that had rolled up to the site with lights flashing. Two protesters were seen lying unconscious in the street.
As dusk fell, demonstrators in the Wan Chai district continued to toss Molotov cocktails at the police while the clanging of bricks on metal street signs — the protesters’ call to arms — echoed through a canyon of tall apartment buildings. Tourists wearing face masks could be seen huddling behind the barricaded plate glass door of their hotel; an older man stepped into the road to yell obscenities at the police.
The police fired tear gas and rubber bullets, and the local news media reported that an Indonesian journalist in Wan Chai had been struck in the eye. The South China Morning Post newspaper also reported, citing an unnamed police source, that an undercover officer had fired a live round into the air in the district after a group of protesters attacked the officer and three undercover colleagues.
The Hong Kong government said on Sunday evening that 13 people had been hospitalized with injuries. The majority were in stable condition, it said, but one woman was in serious condition and another man’s condition was unknown.

Because none of the demonstrations on Sunday had police approval, they were all technically ”illegal assemblies” under Hong Kong law. The police said they used appropriate force to clear the crowds and had deployed tear gas after repeatedly warning protesters to leave.
Sunday’s demonstrations came a day after tens of thousands of protesters rallied to , a pro-democracy campaign. Earlier on Sunday, hundreds of pro-Beijing supporters gathered in a downtown park to sing China’s national anthem.
Human rights activists in various countries had planned dozens of rallies in solidarity with the city’s protest movement on Sunday. A five-hour rally, march and concert in the Taiwanese capital, Taipei, drew thousands, the largest public show of support on the self-governing island for this year’s Hong Kong’s protest movement.
Gong Jow-Jiun, a businessman who attended the Taipei event, said he objected to how the local and central Chinese authorities had handled the Hong Kong protests. He said he also worried about people in Taiwan who were working toward the Chinese government’s goal of unification with Taiwan, which the ruling Communist Party claims as its territory but has never controlled.
“A lot of us look to the future and hope that we don’t end up in the same situation as Hong Kong,” Mr. Gong said.
Before the Taipei event started, a masked man threw a can of red paint at  who had been speaking to local reporters. Taiwan’s Central News Agency later reported that one of the two men arrested in the incident was a member of a fringe pro-Beijing political party.
The protests in Hong Kong and Taiwan this weekend presented a sharp contrast to the atmosphere in Beijing, where the Communist Party is preparing to celebrate the 70th anniversary of its rule on Tuesday with pomp and pageantry.
President Xi Jinping is scheduled to preside over a military parade involving 15,000 soldiers and sailors, 160 fighter jets and other aircraft, and 580 tanks and other weapons.
The Hong Kong government said on Sunday that Carrie Lam, the city’s chief executive, would lead a delegation to Beijing on Monday to join the celebration.

The New York Times,2019-06-21,Demonstrators Keep Pressure on Leader,860 ,"
HONG KONG -- Thousands of protesters blocked a thoroughfare outside Hong Kong's government offices and surrounded the police headquarters on Friday, adding new pressure on the city's leader to withdraw an unpopular bill that has thrown the territory into a political crisis.
The demonstrators, mostly teenagers and people in their 20s and dressed in black, first held a sit-in at a concourse in front of the legislative chambers. Many of them then poured onto a main road by the complex, blocking traffic while chanting calls for the government to withdraw the legislation that would allow extraditions to mainland China. 
  Demonstrators strung up a large, white banner declaring ''This is Hong Kong, not China'' along the side of a pedestrian bridge.
  Kenneth Kwan, a 19-year-old student, said he agreed with the protesters' decision to abandon a sedate sit-in and instead shut down a major road, because he thought it would make a larger statement.
  ''It's a helpless feeling, and we don't know how to make our government respond to our needs,'' he said through a face mask while standing in an eastbound lane of Harcourt Road. Protesters, he said, needed to keep pressure on the government until their demands were met.
  The protesters have vowed to continue demonstrations after a set of demands, chief among them the full withdrawal of contentious legislation that would allow extraditions to mainland China, went unmet by Thursday. They also called for the resignation of Carrie Lam, the city's chief executive, the release of people arrested during clashes with police last week and an investigation into the police's use of force against protesters.
  Other protesters descended on the headquarters of the city's police force, not far from the legislative chambers, where they set up steel barricades blocking the entrance and demanded a meeting with the police chief. ''Shame on dirty cops,'' they chanted.
  Eddie Chu, a pro-democracy lawmaker, led chants urging Stephen Lo, the police chief, and John Lee, the secretary for security, to resign.
  The police urged the protesters to disperse, saying they were obstructing officers' ability to respond to emergencies. The police would send a team of negotiators to persuade the protesters to leave, Yolanda Yu, a police spokeswoman said at a news conference steps from where the protesters had gathered.
  ''The police is not clearing the grounds,'' Ms. Yu said. ''We respect the people to express their views in a peaceful manner.''
  The protesters have felt emboldened since Mrs. Lam indefinitely suspended the extradition bill last week and organizers contend that as many as two million protesters poured onto the streets of downtown Hong Kong on Sunday.
  [These aerial images show you the scale of last Sunday's protest.]
  Those protests prompted Mrs. Lam to deliver a personal, televised public apology for having proposed the bill in the first place.
  But she did not agree to resign or withdraw the bill entirely, as many protesters have demanded. Instead, she said that so long as there was a public dispute over the bill's content, work on it would not resume in Hong Kong's legislature.
  As calls for protesters to gather on Friday around the Legislative Council circulated on social media and in messaging groups, the government shut down its headquarters for the day, citing security concerns. It was not immediately clear if the sit-in would disrupt scheduled meetings of the legislature on Friday.
  The extradition bill would allow the authorities in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory, to send people suspected of crimes to jurisdictions such as mainland China, with which it does not have an extradition agreement. Opponents of the bill fear that, if it becomes law, it would open a door for Beijing to take anyone from Hong Kong -- including dissidents -- into the mainland's opaque judicial system, which is controlled by the Communist Party.
  [As the fight over Hong Kong's future raged, the city's tycoons waited and worried.]
  China's Communist Party under President Xi Jinping has increasingly tried to exert control over Hong Kong, which has its own laws, independent courts and news outlets, and a vocal community of pro-democracy activists and lawmakers. Beijing has steadily eroded those liberties over the last several years, including by trying to silence critics and stacking Hong Kong's leadership with its supporters.
  Many protesters have expressed seething anger at Beijing's encroachment on their rights, most strikingly when hundreds of thousands of people, or as many as one million, descended on central Hong Kong on June 9 in the first of three major demonstrations over the past two weeks. The protests have largely remained peaceful although the police fired tear gas and rubber bullets during skirmishes on June 12 with a large group of protesters, some of whom had thrown bricks and bottles at riot police.
  Perhaps wary about provoking a greater backlash, Mr. Xi's government has so far been muted in its response to the protests. Its Foreign Ministry has said it still supports the bill, and criticized ''foreign forces that interfere'' in Hong Kong's affairs."
The New York Times,2019-11-12,Day of Anger And Violence In Hong Kong,1139 ,"
HONG KONG -- Hong Kong was a city on edge on Monday following escalating violence, in which one demonstrator was shot point blank by a police officer and one man was doused with a flammable liquid and set on fire after he scolded protesters.
At nightfall, both men were fighting for their lives in a city seething with resentments. 
  Protesters have voiced outrage at police officers they see as increasingly resorting to force, and at a government they say has allowed them to act with impunity. Government supporters are embittered over the protesters themselves turning to violence and the damage it has done to their city.
  Months of unrest have thrown the Chinese territory into its worst political crisis in decades, and if Monday was any indication, there is no end in sight.
  Carrie Lam, the city's embattled chief executive, said the mayhem could ''take Hong Kong to the road of ruin'' and denounced those who had set the man on fire as ''enemies of the people.''
  The shooting of the protester set off outrage among many Hong Kongers.
  The young man was shot as commuters, snarled by roadblocks set up by demonstrators, looked on in disbelief. One moment, he was standing on a corner staring into the end of the police officer's handgun. The next, after several shots rang out, he lay crumpled on the ground in the middle of an eerily deserted intersection.
  As blood pooled on the asphalt, a crowd of angry citizens surrounded riot police officers who had arrived as reinforcements. ''Murderer!'' some of them cried.
  An officer doused the crowd with pepper spray.
  Anger quickly unspooled across several districts in the city of more than seven million people, and the protests drew in both suit-clad office workers in the central business district and residents in working-class neighborhoods.
  The other spasm of violence Monday took place on an overpass across town from the shooting. There, a middle-aged man reprimanded a group of protesters, accusing them of lacking patriotism for the Chinese motherland. He was set ablaze.
  ''Go back to the Greater Bay Area!'' protesters shouted at him, using Beijing's term for the region of southern China that includes Hong Kong and neighboring cities.
  The Hospital Authority said that both the protester who had been shot and the man who had been set on fire were in critical condition.
  On Monday night in Washington, the State Department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, said the United States government condemns ''violence on all sides'' and believes ''the increased polarization within Hong Kong society underscores the need for a broad-based and sincere dialogue between the government, protesters, and citizenry writ large.''
  Ms. Ortagus also suggested the United States may no longer grant Hong Kong a favorable trade status different from that of mainland China: ''Hong Kong's autonomy, its adherence to the rule of law, and its commitment to protecting civil liberties are key to preserving its special status under U.S. law,'' she said.
  Tensions in Hong Kong had been building for days, following the death of a student  who fell from a parking garage amid demonstrations.
  Many protesters see the student as a martyr, casting his death as more evidence of excessive use of force by the police. They called for citizens to join in a strike on Monday, and to disrupt transit en masse during the morning commute. Events across the city, including classes at most of its universities, were canceled.
  The scale of the transit disruptions was not as large as a citywide strike that protesters staged on a weekday in early August. But the clashes between protesters and the police were intense by any measure; it was only the third time the police have shot a protester since the demonstrations began.
  Notably, some clashes occurred on the fringes of university campuses that have in recent months generally been off limits to such violence. Protesters threw Molotov cocktails and glass bottles at police lines, while officers responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets.
  Thousands of black-clad protesters also turned up for a flash mob-style demonstration in Hong Kong's central business district around lunchtime, creating a starkly surreal scene in an area filled with luxury malls. Some used orange traffic cones, bricks and wooden poles to set up barricades on main roads.
  On the side of a Giorgio Armani store, a video screen with an ad showing models parading down a runway was defaced with graffiti: ''They shoot, they murder, they are well-paid.''
  Protesters, some of them office workers in full face masks, yelled insults at police officers along the same lines.
  ''Shooting everywhere -- you think you're so cool?'' one said to an officer, adding an expletive. ''Have you killed someone yet today? Have you met your killing quota?''
  Marcus Lee, a 26-year-old lawyer in a charcoal gray suit with a blue face mask, stood with a group of protesters who were shouting at the police.
  ''The gun wasn't necessary, let alone firing shots,'' he said, referring to the morning's shooting. ''You can see how people are reacting to this. They are angry. It's just very ridiculous.''
  In the Kwai Fong district, one video showed a police officer on a motorcycle swerving into a crowd of protesters, clipping at least one of them. The police later said the officer had been suspended from front-line duties.
  As many Hong Kong residents prepared for their evening commute, the smell of tear gas lingered outside their office buildings. In an internal memo, the bank HSBC said that while it was still operating normally, its employees should ''leave the office early and under safe conditions.''
  The months of protests started as a fight over an extradition bill that many residents of the onetime British colony feared made them to vulnerable to mainland China, which resumed control over Hong Kong in 1997. The protests morphed into a broader call for democracy and police accountability.
  Now, neither side seems to agree on what the future should look like -- and neither seems willing to compromise.
  On Monday afternoon, the police urged protesters to stop threatening public safety. And they defended their actions.
  The authorities said that the officer who fired the three live rounds in the Sai Wan Ho area had acted in self-defense against protesters who had been trying to steal his revolver.
  ''We certainly believe our officer did not have bad intention to hurt anyone,'' John Tse, a top police official, told reporters.
  Mrs. Lam, the city's leader, said the protesters were engaging in ''wishful thinking'' if they thought they could pressure the government into making concessions with violence.
  ''I am making this statement clear and loud here,'' she said. ''That will not happen.''Katherine Li, Ezra Cheung and Paul Mozur contributed reporting."

The first major place in China to rebel against Beijing’s technologies of control is one of the last not yet fully under their thrall. 
HONG KONG — There’s no sign to mark it. But when travelers from  cross into Shenzhen in mainland China, they reach a digital cutoff point.
On the  side, the internet is open and unfettered. On the China side, connections wither behind filters and censors that block foreign websites and scrub social media posts. The walk is short, but             is huge.
This invisible but stark technological wall has loomed as  into their fourth month. The semiautonomous city’s proximity to a society that is increasingly closed off and controlled by technology has informed protesters’ concerns about Hong Kong’s future. For many, one fear is the city will fall into a shadow world of surveillance, censorship and digital controls that many have had firsthand experience with during regular travels to China.
The protests are a rare rebellion against Beijing’s vision of . Unsurprisingly, they come from the only major place in China that sits outside            and surveillance. 
The symbols of revolt are rife. Umbrellas, which in Hong Kong five years ago when they were used to deflect pepper spray, are now commonly deployed to shield protester activities — and sometimes violence — from the digital eyes of cameras and smartphones. In late July, protesters painted black the lenses of cameras in front of Beijing’s liaison office in the city. 
Since then,  have smashed cameras to bits. In the subway, cameras are frequently covered in clear plastic wrapping, an attempt to protect a hardware now hunted. In August, protesters pulled down             out of fear it was equipped with artificial-intelligence-powered surveillance software. (Most likely            .) The moment showed how at times the protests in Hong Kong are responding not to the realities on the ground, but to fears of what could happen under stronger controls by Beijing.
This week, as protesters  in some of the most intense clashes since the unrest began in June, umbrellas were opened to block the view of police helicopters. Some people got creative, handing out reflective mylar to stick on goggles to make them harder to film. 
“Before, Hong Kong wouldn’t be using cameras to surveil citizens. To destroy the cameras and the lampposts is a symbolic way to protest,” said Stephanie Cheung, a 20-year-old university student and protester who stood nearby as others bashed the lens out of a dome camera at a subway stop last month. “We are saying we don’t need this surveillance.” 
“Hong Kong, step by step, is walking the road to becoming China,” she said. 
Hong Kong’s situation shows how China’s approach to technology has created new barriers to its goals, even as it has helped ensure the Communist Party’s grip on power. 
In building its censorship and surveillance apparatus, China has separated itself from global norms. Most people — including in Hong Kong — still live in a world that looks technologically more like the United States than China, where services like Facebook, Google and Twitter are blocked. With much of culture and entertainment happening on smartphones, China faces the challenge of asking Hong Kong citizens to give up their main way of digital life. 
In the mainland, President Xi Jinping has strengthened an already muscular tech-powered censorship and surveillance system. 
The government has spent billions to knit together networks that pull from facial recognition and phone-tracking systems. Government apps are used to check phones, register people and enforce discipline within the Communist Party. The  to question the outspoken and the small, but significant, numbers of people who use software to circumvent the internet filters and get on sites like Twitter.
“One country, two systems” — the shorthand to describe China’s and Hong Kong’s separate governance structures — has brought with it one country, two internets. 
Undoing that is an ask that is too large for many. Apps like the Chinese messaging service WeChat, which some in Hong Kong use, in part to connect to people in the mainland, have garnered suspicion. Gum Cheung, 43, an artist and curator who travels to the mainland for work, said he abandoned WeChat last year after he noticed some messages he sent to friends were not getting through. 
“We have to take the initiative to hold the line. The whole internet of mainland China is under government surveillance,” he said. 
The Cyberspace Administration of China did not respond to a faxed request for comment about the impact of internet censorship. The Hong Kong police did not respond to questions about their use of surveillance during the protests.
Beijing’s approach has sometimes encouraged the fears. In recent months, playing to a push from China’s government, Hong Kong’s airline carrier,  of its employees to ensure they do not participate in the protests. Twitter and Facebook took down accounts in what they said was             out of China to change political opinions in Hong Kong. 
The debate over why, how and who watches whom has at times descended into a self-serving back-and-forth between the police and protesters. 
The Hong Kong police have  and             to gain access to their electronics. Sites have also been set up to try to identify protesters based on their social media accounts. More recently, the police             on bus passengers to pinpoint escaping protesters.
Protesters have called for the police to release footage showing what they alleged were abuses at Hong Kong’s subway station in Kowloon in August. Hong Kong’s subway operator fired back, pointing out that protesters had destroyed cameras that might have gotten the footage. Other than a few screenshots, they have not released footage.
“Trust in institutions is what separates Hong Kong from China,” said Lokman Tsui, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “The fast-eroding trust in the government and law enforcement, and concurrently the growing fear and paranoia about government surveillance, is what makes Hong Kong society more and more like China’s.”
Privacy concerns on both sides have driven efforts to maintain real-life anonymity. Police officers have stopped wearing badges with names or numbers. Protesters have covered their faces with masks. Both sides are carrying out increasingly sophisticated attempts to identify the other online. 
Each even has a matching, if often ineffective, countermeasure to video surveillance. Protesters shine laser pointers at lenses of police cameras to help hide themselves. Police officers have strobe lights attached to their uniforms that can make it hard to capture their images.
“Of course we’re worried about the cameras,” said Tom Lau, 21, a college student. “If we lose, the cameras recorded what we’ve done, and they can bide their time and settle the score whenever they want.”
“We still have decades in front of us,” he said. “There will be a record. Even if we don’t want to work for the government, what if big companies won’t hire us?”

The New York Times,2019-08-24,"Hong Kong Protesters, Calling for Direct Elections, Join Hands Across City",852 ,"
HONG KONG -- Hong Kong residents on Friday night formed human chains across large parts of the city in a call for direct elections, a test of the continuing strength of the monthslong protest movement and a display that recalled a major anti-Soviet demonstration from 30 years ago.
Participants fanned out across three routes over densely populated sections of Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories. Organizers said on Saturday that more than 210,000 people had participated, covering a total length of about 35 miles. 
  The plans developed quickly online this week after a march on Sunday drew hundreds of thousands who demonstrated in the rain, a sign that protesters had not been dissuaded by a police ban or warnings from the Chinese government.
  Participants on Friday sang protest songs and chanted slogans. While many joined hands, others held up their cellphones to illuminate the lines of people. Several held signs with flags of foreign nations and the phrase, ''Thank you for supporting freedom and democracy!''
  They lined up along Victoria Harbor and on Lion Rock, the peak that overlooks the Kowloon Peninsula. They stood amid apartment towers and on busy shopping streets, beside drinkers spilling out of bars and office workers heading home after work.
  ''I want to deliver a message to the world that we are peaceful,'' said Lee Kin, 29, an insurance company employee who joined the chain in the Wanchai neighborhood on Hong Kong Island. ''Even though I support fighting violently against the Chinese Communist Party, if we can demonstrate peacefully, we can get more support from the rest of the world.''
  The event followed a variety of protest efforts, including marches, petitions, advertisements in international publications and walkways filled with art, as well as more confrontational actions such as defacing government buildings, clashing with the police and blocking roadways and trains.
  Elsa Lam, 44, a clerk in the catering industry, said she seldom joined protests, but had brought her 8-year-old son, Aiden, to the gathering in the Causeway Bay neighborhood.
  ''I came out with him today because I'm worried that he can no longer enjoy freedom of assembly when he grows up,'' she said.
  Paul Au, 62, the owner of a small record store, previously participated in several protest movements in Hong Kong, including after the deadly crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. None of those, he said, were as large as the demonstrations that have taken place this summer.
  ''We have shown today that we are very peaceful, so let's see what they can do to us,'' Mr. Au said after joining protesters in the Sham Shui Po neighborhood. ''The whole world is watching, you know. The people who are right will win. Justice wins.''
  A spreadsheet posted online asked likely participants where they planned to go, then calculated where turnout would be above or below expectations, in order to direct people to empty spots in the chain. In some places where the numbers were too large, the line snaked into side streets then back onto the main route.
  The demonstration was a display ''of the solidarity and unity of Hong Kong people,'' said Joshua Wong, a prominent activist.
  ''The turnout today was really a surprise,'' he said. ''We just had less than five days to prepare the whole Hong Kong Way action. And people peacefully gathered. Just proves: No police, we have peace.''
  Friday is the 30th anniversary of the 1989 Baltic Way protest, when as many as two million residents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania formed a human chain to call for independence from the Soviet Union.
  Avoiding the fate of the Soviet Union has been a preoccupation of the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, and other Chinese officials. During a 2017 visit to Hong Kong, Mr. Xi gave a stern warning that challenging China's sovereignty ''crosses the red line.''
  The organizers have not emphasized the pro-independence sentiment of the Baltic protest that inspired Friday's event. The Hong Kong protests began over a government plan to allow extraditions to mainland China. The proposal has since been shelved, but the lack of a full withdrawal continues to drive protests.
  Demands have expanded to include amnesty for arrested protesters and an investigation into police violence. Friday's protest raised those demands, with an emphasis on others: expanding democracy in Hong Kong and making the chief executive, who is now selected by a committee of about 1,200, a directly elected position.
  ''The great majority of participants in protests are not advocates of Hong Kong independence,'' said Willy Lam, adjunct professor at the Center for China Studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ''They have chosen this Baltic human chain as a symbol of unity.''
  One widely read post on a bulletin board used by protesters said that while more militant protesters might find such an activity ''silly,'' it was important that they still participate.
  ''We are all Hong Kongers,'' it said. ''We shouldn't divide into 'militant' and 'peaceful.' To win we must be more unified than our opponent.''"
The New York Times,2019-07-03,Videos From Protests Put Glare on Hong Kong Police,1530 ,"
Dozens of people in Hong Kong say they were injured by the police during a mass demonstration in June against a contentious bill that would allow extraditions to mainland China.
The New York Times reviewed hundreds of videos and photos posted online by witnesses, along with submissions to our WhatsApp tip line, to assess whether the Hong Kong police used excessive force. Experts at Amnesty International, a human rights group, helped examine the footage. We spoke to specialists in crowd control and interviewed more than two dozen protesters. 
  The videos show protesters being beaten by police officers, shot with riot-control ammunition, dragged on the ground and hit with tear gas during large-scale confrontations on June 12 near the headquarters of Hong Kong's government. Their injuries included bruised ribs, broken fingers and respiratory problems.
  The authorities began to use force after a small group of protesters threw bricks, bottles and umbrellas at officers and attempted to push through rings of heavily armored police.
  But the protests were largely peaceful, and human rights groups have denounced the actions of the police as excessive and illegal. The British government, which ruled Hong Kong until its handover to mainland China in 1997, has demanded an investigation. Hong Kong officials say police officers acted with restraint.
  Here's what the evidence shows.
  Violence Toward the Unarmed
  In several instances, police officers beat protesters who posed no apparent threat.
  Video shows Ng Ying-mo, 57, a retired mechanics instructor, walking within 12 yards of a police line outside government offices. He asks the police to stop provoking protesters. Then he begins yelling obscenities.
  An officer aims a gun, which weapons experts said was likely loaded with balls containing pepper spray, in the direction of Mr. Ng. A gunshot is heard, and then Mr. Ng is on the ground, clutching his lower abdomen. Three officers pick him up and carry him away.

  Mr. Ng had planned to go hiking on the day of the protests. But he grew emotional when he heard about tense standoffs between the riot police and young protesters, and decided to join in.
  ''I hoped to shield them at least for a while, so they wouldn't face such danger,'' Mr. Ng said.
  Mr. Ng, who suffers from lung cancer, said he fainted from the pain and woke up to the police dropping him on the ground. They continued to beat him, he said, ripping his T-shirt and shorts and leaving him with bruises. He was charged with participating in an unlawful assembly and released on bail.
  A protester stands in the middle of the same road where Mr. Ng was injured. Suddenly, riot police rush toward him, pulling him to the ground and beating him.
  The man is taken to the sidewalk and forcefully handled by several officers. He was arrested on charges of participating in an unlawful assembly and obstructing the duties of a police officer, according to Icarus Wong, a member of Civil Rights Observer, an advocacy group that is assisting the man, who did not want to be identified.
  In another video, a man who is distributing water to protesters near the General Post Office is attacked by police. A group of at least eight police officers pepper sprays him, punches him and beats him with batons. He falls to the ground, and an officer puts him in a chokehold. The man was left with a scar under his left eye, according to his lawyer, Bond Ng, who declined to identify him. He was arrested and later released on bail, his lawyer said.
  ''This is basically an essay on how not to police a protest movement,'' said Dr. Rohini Haar of Physicians for Human Rights, an advocacy organization. ''Beating of unarmed protesters who are not posing any active threat'' is a violation of law enforcement principles prescribed by the United Nations, she said.
  In the video below, protesters run from police outside the main entrance to Hong Kong's Legislative Council. Florence Chan, a protester who had been singing hymns, falls to the ground amid the chaos. At least four officers begin to attack her with batons and shields.
  Ms. Chan said in an interview that she begged the officers to stop hitting her. ''I thought they were going to beat me to death,'' Ms. Chan said. She said she was left with bumps on her head, bruises on her arms and swollen feet.
  Experts said the police did not seem to have a legitimate reason to beat the protesters.
  ''The officers are using force when the person is already on the floor,'' said Ara Marcen Naval, an arms control adviser at Amnesty International. ''That's abusive and certainly unlawful.''
  The police did not respond to a request for comment. Hong Kong officials have defended the police's actions, describing officers as well trained and saying they acted with restraint. The police initially described the protests as a riot and accused the protesters of committing ''life-threatening acts.''
  Even as many in Hong Kong denounce the police, others have defended their response. On Sunday, tens of thousands of people attended a rally in support of the police, with some holding signs praising the Hong Kong police as the ''best in Asia.''
  The police and a government-appointed watchdog have promised an investigation, but protesters have called for an independent inquiry.
  The government has said that at least 81 people were injured in the June 12 demonstrations, though it has not specified how many were protesters or how they were hurt. Separately, the police have said 22 officers were injured.
  Chaos and Tear Gas Inside a Skyscraper
  Some of the most chaotic scenes took place at Citic Tower, a 33-story office building near the epicenter of the protests. Police used tear gas to attack protesters and confine them outside the tower's main entrance, causing panic, videos show.
  Early on June 12, protesters set up barricades outside the tower.
  Around 3 p.m., police officers surround the tower on both sides, firing tear gas. Trapped by the police and barricades, protesters rush toward the tower's main entrance.
  Hundreds of people rush into the tower through a revolving door. The protesters who make it inside attempt to break open locked doors to allow more people through. The police continue to fire tear gas into the crowd of protesters, and it soon fills the building.
  Ivy Chan, 44, a volunteer who was assisting protesters outside the tower, said she saw people pounding on the doors of the tower, desperate to escape.
  ''It was terrifying,'' Ms. Chan, a bartender, said. ''We kept telling people to calm down and asking the police to exercise restraint and to not shoot any more tear gas.''
  International experts on the use of tear gas said the Hong Kong police had used it without a clear strategy, causing unnecessary panic and heightening the risk of casualties. They said the amount deployed was excessive, given that the demonstrators were largely peaceful.
  ''They're actually inciting and causing what looks like a stampede,'' Dr. Haar said.
  A Lawmaker Confronts the PoliceAs the protests escalated, Wu Chi-wai, a prominent Hong Kong lawmaker, wanted to have a word with the police. So he marched to the front lines of the protest, identifying himself as a lawmaker in a loud voice, and demanded to see a commander.
  As Mr. Wu, 56, moves toward the police, a commander in a white shirt directs another officer to fire tear gas, which lands a few meters behind Mr. Wu, videos show. Mr. Wu continues marching and a second canister is fired and lands much closer to him, catching fire upon impact.
  Anna Feigenbaum, an expert on tear gas at Bournemouth University in Britain, said the officers appeared to use tear gas like a firearm. ''It should never really be used to single out someone,'' she said.
  Mr. Wu, chairman of the Hong Kong Democratic Party, said he posed no threat. ''If they can blow tear gas on me,'' he said, ''that means they can blow tear gas everywhere.''
  'They Treated Me Like A Dead Object'
  Ali Li, a 21-year-old university student, thought the protests over the extradition bill might get turbulent. But she did not anticipate that she would leave the demonstrations with bruises covering her body, a painful finger injury and cuts on her forehead.
  As the police ordered protesters to leave an area near the Hong Kong Legislature, Ms. Li tripped on a barricade and lost her balance. Suddenly, at least four officers surrounded her and grabbed her arms, trying to subdue her. She fell to the ground and the police fired pepper spray at her face, she said.
  Ms. Li said she was dragged for more than 150 meters by the police into the offices of the legislature. She screamed along the way.
  ''They treated me like a dead object,'' Ms. Li said in an interview. ''They have lost their sanity.''
  Ms. Li was arrested on charges of participating in an unlawful assembly and released after about two hours, she said. She stopped protesting because she said she was too afraid of the police. ''Even now,'' she said, ''I feel so scared.''"

The city descended into chaos despite the leader’s warning not to challenge Beijing in “very dangerous” ways.
Tear gas engulfed districts as protesters besieged police stations.
Riot police officers fired many volleys of tear gas at protesters near government offices, apartment complexes, shopping malls and parks across Hong Kong on Monday, as clashes with demonstrators plunged a broad stretch of the territory into chaos.
Antigovernment demonstrators fanned out across at least a half-dozen districts, occupying roads and hurling objects at police stations as they tested the limits of the police force. They set a fire outside a police station in Sha Tin, in the New Territories region of northern Hong Kong, that quickly swelled until flames licked the sides of the building. Firefighters extinguished the blaze. 
Activists called for a general strike and rallies on Monday, leading to service disruptions on several subway and rail lines and the cancellation of more than 200 flights from the city’s airport. 
The officers arrested dozens of people, pinning some to the ground, and fired multiple rounds of tear gas, filling the air with white, acrid fumes. Local news outlets said that the riot officers also shot off rubber bullets.
The clashes on Monday were particularly widespread, even by the standards of the unrest that has roiled the city almost every weekend since early June. The clashes encompassed several districts where clashes had occurred in recent days and weeks, including several working-class neighborhoods, a shopping mall that is popular with mainland tourists, and a highway near the Hong Kong legislature. But the protests also ventured into other areas, including a town in Hong Kong’s northern reaches that had not previously been the site of any violence. 
The police have repeatedly defended their use of tear gas, saying it is deployed only to disperse demonstrators who gather illegally or vandalize property. They have urged residents to stay indoors and keep their windows closed during such crackdowns.
But protesters and their supporters say the police are using tear gas indiscriminately. Many have raised questions about how the spraying of tear gas in dense urban areas might affect the health of vulnerable residents, such as pregnant women and old people.
[]
The mass demonstrations started in early June over an unpopular extradition bill, but the protesters’ demands quickly expanded to include calls for an independent commission to investigate alleged police misconduct, for the resignation of the city’s top leader and for the release of detained protesters. 
The protesters have also increasingly called for greater democracy in the territory — a reflection of pent-up anger and frustration with the rapid erosion of civil liberties in Hong Kong under Chinese rule. There is a widespread perception that the territory’s political elite is more beholden to Beijing than to local residents.
Separately, video footage circulating Monday morning appeared to show a van breaking through a barricade that protesters had set up on a road in the satellite town of Yuen Long, where . 
As the vehicle drove through, it scattered the crowd and appeared to hit at least one protester.
Late Monday, a large group of men armed with long sticks attacked the protesters in the eastern district of North Point, local news outlets reported. Earlier, the protesters had warned in chat groups about the presence of the mob. 
City’s leader warns protesters against challenging Beijing.
 warned that the antigovernment protests that have roiled the city for two months sought to challenge Beijing’s authority in ways that were “very dangerous” and would ruin the semiautonomous territory’s future.
In a news conference on Monday, the territory’s leader, Carrie Lam, condemned the increasingly confrontational tactics of protesters in recent weeks and vowed to restore law and order in the financial hub. 
“This is the time for us to rally together, to set aside differences and bring back order and say ‘no’ to chaos and violence,” Ms. Lam said as the city was brought to standstill on Monday during a general strike and demonstrations that interrupted the morning commute for millions of people. 
In recent demonstrations, a core group of protesters have tried to surround the central government’s representative office in the city, , and over the past weekend             in a move that was swiftly condemned by Beijing. 
“Some people have tarnished the national emblem and even removed the national flag and thrown it into the sea,” Mrs. Lam said. 
“In recent days, what we can see are obvious and willful statements of ‘Restore Hong Kong, revolution of our times,’” Mrs. Lam said, citing a slogan from a pro-independence movement that has re-emerged in recent protest chants. 
“We can see some actions challenging ‘One Country, Two Systems’ and the country’s national sovereignty, and if I can even speak more boldly, they want to topple Hong Kong, to thoroughly destroy the livelihoods that 7 million people cherish.”
The demonstrations began this summer initially as a way to protest a bill that would allow residents and visitors to Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China for trial. Ms. Lam repeated her stance that the bill was “dead,” and said the city should not let the protesters use the cause as a pretext for pushing against Chinese rule.
“If we continue to allow these violent protesters to make use of the Fugitive Offenders’ bill and these demands to conceal their ulterior motives, that is going to push Hong Kong to the verge of a very dangerous situation,” she said.
Protesters occupy a shopping mall where clashes erupted last month.
Hong Kong’s finance secretary, Paul Chan, told reporters on Monday morning that a summer of protests had already depressed the city’s economic growth. As an example, he cited sagging profits in the city’s luxury retail and jewelry sectors.
Hours later, as if to underscore Mr. Chan’s point, thousands of protesters streamed into a luxury mall, scattering bewildered shoppers in their wake.
Many of the protesters sat on the mall’s ground floor, while others stood on a balcony holding yellow signs that said “strike,” “boycott business,” and “boycott classes.”
The mall, New Town Plaza in Sha Tin, was the site of  that left more than two dozen people injured.
“I’m here because I’m on strike today. This city needs saving, so how can we still go to work like nothing is wrong?” said Tammy Chan, 28, who said she works in human resources. “I understand that people might have different values, and they might think that their jobs and their money are more important. But the truth is, if our home is destroyed by the Beijing government and all their lackeys, money isn’t going to be able to fix this society.”
By Monday evening, several luxury stores around the city — including in Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui, two major shopping districts that  — had closed early for the day.
Demonstrators rally across the city.
Thousands of antigovernment protesters rallied in swirling crowds across parks, shopping malls and other public spaces on Monday afternoon to support the general strike.
Outside government offices in Admiralty, a downtown district on Hong Kong Island, protesters blocked traffic by moving steel and plastic barriers — some erected by the police weeks earlier for crowd control — to a nearby highway.
Janice Lau, 38, a teacher who had taken her 6-year-old daughter to a rally in a nearby park, pumped her fist in encouragement.
“I’m proud of them,” she said of the protesters, minutes before riot police officers began attempting to clear the crowd with tear gas. “Society forced them to do this, and they didn’t harm society.”
Arthur Chan, a physical education teacher at a Hong Kong university, was among those who attended a rally on Monday in the northwestern district of Tuen Mun.
“I asked for leave especially for today because I’ve seen injustice,” said Mr. Chan, 24, noting that one of his students was among the . The charge carries a prison term of up to 10 years. 
“I feel particularly worried about him,” Mr. Chan said of his student. “He’s in his 20s, he does well in school and he’s very nice. I used to be sure that he had a bright future.”
Police say hundreds have been arrested this summer.
 said on Monday that officers had arrested 420 people since protests in the territory began in early June, including 82 on Monday.
Officers have also fired 1,000 rounds of tear gas and around 160 rubber bullets over the same time period, two police officials said in a news conference. 
“We are here to maintain order to protect the community,” said Kong Wing Cheung, the police superintendent. 
The scale and intensity of the police response to the protests has prompted criticism from residents. 
Critics note that when protesters occupied central Hong Kong for 79 days in 2014, the police used tear gas more sparingly. But supporters say the police have regularly shown restraint, and did not use force against the demonstrators even when they . 
Strikes ground planes and delay public transit.
Hong Kong, , was brought to a standstill on Monday, with more than 200 flights grounded and commuter trains disrupted as a citywide strike and demonstrations roiled the territory. 
At the height of the morning rush, protesters blocked the doors of subway cars, causing delays throughout the system that kept millions of people from getting to work. 
The disruptions were the third time in three weeks that protesters have interrupted train service. RTHK, a local broadcaster, said one-third of the Hong Kong International Airport’s air traffic controllers had joined the strike.
Dancus Au, 24, who works at a security firm, said he had been stuck at the Tai Wai subway station since early Monday morning but he blamed his inability to get to work on the city’s leader’s refusal to withdraw the extradition bill.
“My post is crucial because a security firm requires a lot of people to support its operation,” Mr. Au said. “Carrie Lam has caused my absence today. She should have said ‘withdraw’ at the beginning of this fiasco. She is part of the root cause while Beijing is another part of it.”
“I think the general strike is one of the last resorts that the protesters think are possible to express their views. I don’t blame them,” he said, adding that he was considering attending a protest rally.
At least 200 flights were canceled, most of them aboard Hong Kong’s flag carrier Cathay Pacific. 
‘Disappointing!’ one pro-establishment politician says of city leader’s speech. 
Prominent lawmakers across the political spectrum criticized Mrs. Lam, the city’s leader, saying her remarks in the morning about the protests provided no solutions to the political crisis that has roiled the territory for two months.
Claudia Mo, a lawmaker in , called Mrs. Lam’s administration “morally bankrupt” for failing to take responsibility for the unrest. 
Mrs. Lam said on Monday that protesters had recently started to chant a slogan that challenged Beijing’s authority over the territory. But Ms. Mo said the slogan alone — “Revive Hong Kong, revolution of our times”— did not prove that protesters were demanding independence. 
“A slogan is a slogan is a slogan,” Ms. Mo said. “If she thinks that is a problem, what is the solution to it? Well, we’ll advise her: Try democracy.”
Ann Chiang, a lawmaker from Hong Kong’s largest pro-Beijing party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, also criticized Mrs. Lam’s performance. 
“Carrie Lam raised many questions at the news conference, but where are the solutions?” Ms. Chiang wrote on Facebook. “Disappointing!!!”
Antony Dapiran, a Hong Kong-based lawyer and the author of a book about dissent in Hong Kong, called the news conference a “disaster,” in part because it included no concessions and came before the public turnout of Monday’s general strike was fully apparent. 
Mrs. Lam has presented no clear way out of the crisis, he said, while the protesters have become increasingly confrontational. 
“For me the most alarming thing is we’re kind of on a knife’s edge here — open disrespect for the police, police stations being targeted,” he said. “We are on the cusp of what could be a general breakdown of law and order. It hasn’t gotten there yet, but the government hasn’t done anything to stop it.”
Joseph Wong, the former head of , said he had not even bothered to listen to Mrs. Lam’s speech because he had lost faith in her. Mr. Wong said that instead of condemning protesters, Mrs. Lam should act on their demands — for example, by formally withdrawing the contentious extradition bill and commissioning an independent inquiry into the police response to recent mob attacks in a Hong Kong metro station. 
“The Chief Executive has the responsibility to set a good example by complying with the rule of law,” he added. “Many people doubt the chief executive herself is doing precisely what she keeps on preaching to the Hong Kong people.”
China calls on Hong Kong public to “stop the violence.”
China’s state-run media denounced the resurgence of unrest in Hong Kong, portraying the demonstrators as lawless and warning that Beijing would not tolerate a descent into chaos.
The People’s Daily, the flagship newspaper of the ruling Communist Party, on Monday  committed by the protesters, including insulting the Chinese flag — an apparent reference to protesters who threw a Chinese flag into the harbor on Saturday.
The newspaper called on the Hong Kong public to rally behind the local police and to “stop the violence,” saying the protesters wanted to end the “one country, two systems” arrangement that has governed the territory since its handover to mainland China in 1997.
“They simply want to push Hong Kong into chaos,” the editorial said of the protesters. 
The Global Times, a hawkish tabloid, also raised the  by the mainland authorities in Hong Kong, a position embraced by some Chinese nationalists. 
“The central government will not allow the complete fall of the rule of law in Hong Kong,” the newspaper said in an editorial on Sunday. “A few mobs can confuse Hong Kong for a while, but they absolutely cannot overthrow the order of Hong Kong completely.”
Chinese news stations showed  inside Hong Kong subway cars, trying to argue, without evidence, that they had lost public support.
The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing, which oversees central government policy for the city, invited Hong Kong reporters to a news conference on Tuesday, the second since last week. The office is also scheduled to hold a meeting on Wednesday in Shenzhen, the mainland city closest to Hong Kong, to discuss recent developments with Hong Kong delegates to the national congress, the Hong Kong broadcaster RTHK reported.
Skipping work to join Monday’s strike carries legal risks, experts say.
Hong Kong is a financial hub with an international reputation for efficiency and order.
Not surprisingly, the city’s government offers limited protections for striking workers. 
Some employers signaled that they would tolerate workers’ absence, including the Catholic Diocese and at least two local universities.
But because the general strike is a political action and not a labor dispute, scholars say, those who take part would not be covered by the limited protections offered to striking workers under Hong Kong law.
“Anyone on the general strike can be counted as being a brave person,” said Rick Glofcheski, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong. “In the current political mood, there are millions of them in Hong Kong. But basically you don’t have any protection.”
Maggie Chung, a 32-year-old accountant who attended a protest rally on Sunday, said that she planned to join the strike even though she had not yet passed the probationary period of her new job. “If I lose my job, I can find another one,” she said. “But if Hong Kong is lost, it’s gone forever.”
Protesters are nimble and unpredictable.
One emerging feature of the civil disobedience gripping Hong Kong: Protesters are increasingly trying to keep the authorities guessing their next move.
Over the weekend, groups of black-clad protesters appeared with little warning in neighborhoods across the city, in some cases blocking roads and vandalizing police stations. And in many instances, they disappeared before the police could tackle them to the ground or disperse them with tear gas and pepper spray.
“We are not as well equipped as the police, so we have to be as fluid as possible,” Jason Law, a 19-year-old protester, said on Sunday.
The flash-mob-style tactics continued Monday morning as protesters briefly occupied subway stations and roads across the city, including in the satellite town of Yuen Long, the site of mob attacks against demonstrators last month.
Many protesters have linked the tactics to the phrase “Be water,” a reference to  in a 1971 episode of the American television series “Longstreet.” The protesters say the phrase captures their strategy of trying to outrun the authorities by swiftly changing tactics and targets.

The New York Times ,2019-09-18,Hong Kong Unrest Leads to Cancellation of Horse Races at Iconic Track,566 ,"
HONG KONG — A night of horse racing at Hong Kong’s iconic Happy Valley Racecourse was canceled just hours before post time on Wednesday over the potential “imminent threat” to the safety of jockeys, horses and bettors, racing authorities said.
The extremely popular Wednesday night races — which draw a mix of Cantonese bettors and beer-swilling expats — had until now been largely unhurt by the unrest roiling the former British colony. But officials decided to cancel the night of racing when protesters began seizing on reports that a horse part-owned by one of Hong Kong’s most polarizing figures, the pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho, was set to race on Wednesday evening.
“Our concerns are tied to potential social unrest in the vicinity tonight,” a Hong Kong Jockey Club spokesperson said in a statement, citing “the very real threat of a disturbance or possible violence” at the racecourse and potential disruptions to public transportation in the area.
Also on Wednesday, the Hong Kong government canceled the annual fireworks for the celebration of China’s National Day, marking the founding of People’s Republic of China. The Oct. 1 holiday is expected to draw big protests in the city.
[]
Horse racing was introduced to Hong Kong by the British in the 1840s, and the Wednesday night races at Happy Valley — founded in 1846 as the first racecourse in the territory — have become a fixture in society.
The colonial-era sport is so emblematic of the city that China’s late paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, promised that after Britain’s handover of Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997, “horses will still run, stocks will still sizzle, dancers will still dance.”
But the three months of pro-democracy protests have brought increasing disruptions to the transit system, spilled over into sleepy residential neighborhoods and even descended into street brawls and fistfights between civilians.
Mr. Ho, the target of the protesters’ ire, has long been known for his unforgiving view of pro-democracy figures and protesters. In July,  with a group of men believed to have beaten protesters with sticks and metal bars in an attack the same day that injured at least 45 people. He had denied any connection to the attackers.
Mr. Ho’s district office was later destroyed and his mother’s grave was defaced. Last Saturday, a fire broke out at the same office.
In recent days, he urged his supporters to turn out Saturday to take down the so-called Lennon Walls across the city — vibrant mosaics of pro-democracy messages and artwork. In response, protesters have rallied for citywide demonstrations against Mr. Ho that same day.
The cancellation of the night of racing is another blow to an engine of Hong Kong’s economy — the races and heavy betting on them help generate money for the Hong Kong Jockey Club, which finances charities and projects around the city. The city’s overall economy has been slammed since protests began in June, weighing on the retail and tourism sector in particular.

HONG KONG -- The pastor pulled on his respirator and ran directly into the fog of tear gas in central Hong Kong. He was trailed by a homemaker, a retired accountant and a middle-school teacher.
Undaunted by the pandemonium of gasping protesters, they pointed people to safety and poured saline into the eyes of those overcome by the fumes. 
  With their yellow vests and portable loudspeakers, Pastor Ka-Kit Ao and his volunteers are an unmistakable presence at the antigovernment protests that have upended this semiautonomous Chinese territory. They form human cordons between protesters and advancing police. They beg baton-swinging officers to go easy. And they solicit the names of those being hustled away in handcuffs so pro bono lawyers can follow up with assistance.
  ''I sometimes wonder whether we are doing anything of value, but we can't just sit at home,'' Pastor Ao, 34, said one recent afternoon before heading into the maelstrom with members of his group, Protect the Children.
  Now entering their sixth month, Hong Kong's protests have been notable for their longevity, and for the huge throngs willing to defy the authorities with their demands for democracy and police accountability. Thousands of protesters, including office workers, descended Tuesday on Central, the main business and shopping district, forcing businesses to close and paralyzing traffic and the city's fabled tram service.
  Behind the scenes, this largely leaderless movement has been sustained by a vast network of ordinary people who hand out bottled water and red bean soup at marches, drive home stranded protesters late at night and donate the gas masks that fortify demonstrators during their pitched battles with police. Hong Kong professionals have been especially vital.
  Graphic artists create the eye-catching protest posters across the city. Psychologists provide free counseling to the emotionally distressed. And emergency room doctors, working in clandestine clinics, set shattered bones.
  One measure of community spirit can be heard many nights at 10 p.m., when residents in densely packed neighborhoods open their windows and shout protest slogans to the heavens. Another is expressed through the crowdfunding campaigns that have raised millions of dollars for medical treatment, legal defense funds and other expenses.
  ''Without this public support, the movement would have lost steam a lot sooner,'' said Victoria Hui, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame and the author of a book about the Umbrella Movement, the 2014 pro-democracy protests that fizzled after 10 weeks. ''It encourages young people to keep going, giving them the sense they are not alone and that what they are doing is righteous.''
  Although actions like setting the man on fire risk eroding support, the protest movement so far has enjoyed broad backing among Hong Kong's seven million people. A recent survey by the Chinese University of Hong Kong found that nearly 60 percent of respondents approved of the protesters' violent tactics, agreeing that they were justified in the face of an increasingly aggressive police response and a government unwilling to compromise.
  This public support presents a thorny challenge to the authorities, who have been hoping to quell the protests by driving a wedge between the increasingly radical agitators and those sympathetic to their cause.
  ''The more the government suppresses this movement and tries to scare people, the more people will step out and stand up,'' said Pastor Roy Chan, a founder of Protect the Children, which has nearly 200 members.
  The encrypted messaging app Telegram serves as the town hall for the support network, with dozens of channels that match volunteers to those in need. Most prolific are the channels offering rides to protesters affected by the subway shutdowns that the authorities impose to dampen protest turnout. The rides also help protesters avoid the police sweeps that target public buses.
  Like many drivers, Patrick Chan, 38, a garment factory manager, said fear of arrest kept him away from the protests, most of which the police have deemed illegal. Guilt and shame, though, are powerful motivators.
  Mr. Chan spends hours in his beat-up BMW sedan ferrying weary, sweat-drenched protesters to housing complexes across the city.
  ''These young people are trying to right the wrongs that we have long been avoiding,'' he said, referring to Beijing's two-decade effort to chip away at the vaunted liberties that differentiate this former British colony from mainland China. ''They are paying with their futures, risking the possibility of being locked up for years. We owe them.''
  The sense of public service has also mobilized dozens of doctors, nurses and medics. Much of their work takes place in secret. That is because all but the most grievously injured protesters avoid Hong Kong's hospitals following the arrest in June of several people who had sought care for broken bones and blunt trauma. These days, the injured are sometimes treated at clandestine clinics that provide X-rays and rudimentary surgery.
  Dr. Tim Wong works the protests after his regular hospital shift. An emergency room doctor, he decided to act after the police made a number of arrests at his hospital, which he declined to name for fear that it might endanger his employment.
  ''Since then, no one has come to our emergency room for treatment, unless they are escorted by the police,'' he said. ''It's outrageous. Hospitals should be sanctuaries.''
  One recent evening, he hovered near the front lines of a skirmish as Molotov cocktails, bricks and tear gas canisters arced overhead. Many of those needing medical treatment were bystanders caught up in the mayhem.
  Just then, Pastor Ao and another member of his group rushed by carrying a man injured by a tear-gas canister. All three of them were weeping. ''I can't believe this is happening to our city,'' the pastor wailed as they dragged the man to a first aid clinic inside a Methodist Church that has become a beacon for protesters.
  Earlier that afternoon, Pastor Ao and scores of volunteers had gathered at a subway station to plot the day's movements. After dividing up into teams of seven, he reminded everyone to refrain from chanting slogans and urged them to be polite to law enforcement authorities.
  ''They might call us cockroaches but we should refer to them as police officers,'' he said. Then everyone bowed their heads in prayer. ''May we have God's protection and the patience, love and wisdom to deal with the police,'' Pastor Ao said.
  Volunteers say the police rarely return the favor, treating them as antagonists. In September, the police were widely criticized after a video emerged that appeared to show a knot of officers kicking a Protect the Children member as he lay on the ground. The man, wearing the group's trademark yellow vest, was later arrested.
  At a news conference, a senior police official dismissed allegations of abuse, suggesting that the video had been doctored and that what many saw as a person was actually ''a yellow object.'' In the weeks that followed, the group's ranks swelled with new recruits, Pastor Ao said.
  Many of the group's volunteers are retirees like Ah Lin He. A fiery, reed-thin woman, Ms. He, 68, was born in the Chinese city of Guangzhou and swam to Hong Kong in 1972 to escape the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. She doggy-paddled for 10 hours with five other people. Only three of them made it to shore.
  ''I've seen the repression and madness that can be unleashed by the Communists in China,'' she said as the group trudged to a protest that had turned violent.
  Walking beside her was Joe Pao, a 29-year-old pastor, who joined the group after a brief stint as a protester. ''I realized I could do something more useful than throwing bricks,'' Pastor Pao said.
  He acknowledged that his role as a putative peacemaker was rarely gratifying. Most of his work involves urging the police to exercise restraint. ''When they catch people, we tell them to please respect the powers they have and not abuse them,'' he said. ''The impact is definitely small.''
  The majority of protest supporters operate more independently. Nam Kwan, a cultural foundation administrator, has fed, housed and comforted scores of youths whose parents, enraged by their participation in the protests, tossed them out of their homes.
  She traces her transformation from silent sympathizer to frenetic den mother to June 12, when the police escalated their tactics by firing rubber bullets and beanbag rounds at unarmed protesters.
  ''When I heard the first gunshot, a bell rang inside me and I automatically found my place,'' she said. ''Nowadays my phone is on 24 hours a day because I'm afraid I might miss urgent messages or calls for help.''
  In addition to buying protective gear for protesters, she coordinates financial support and car pools from wealthy friends eager to help but reluctant to do so publicly. Oftentimes, she finds herself on the street, dispensing hugs or patiently listening to the worries of young protesters.
  ''Every time these kids go to the front lines, they fear for their lives,'' she said. ''But what they fear more is abandonment, that one day we will all turn our backs and leave them alone.''"
The New York Times ,2019-09-06,Hong Kong Protests Resume After Carrie Lam Offers Olive Branch,750 ,"
HONG KONG — Tear gas, pepper spray and fire returned to the streets of Hong Kong on Friday, as police officers clashed with masked pro-democracy protesters in the first notable display of unrest since Hong Kong’s top leader  that she would withdraw a deeply unpopular extradition bill.
It was an early sign that the protests that have convulsed this city for three months are likely to continue. More protest actions are planned for this weekend, including an attempt to disrupt access to the airport on Saturday and a march on Sunday to the United States consulate to urge Congress to pass a bipartisan proposal to penalize officials who suppress freedoms in Hong Kong.
The protests were ignited in June by the contentious extradition bill, which would have exposed Hong Kongers to the mainland’s opaque judiciary, but its withdrawal now seemed unlikely to fully placate the movement, which has since broadened far beyond that single issue to include calls for fundamental political reforms and an independent inquiry into police behavior. Other demands include amnesty for arrested protesters and the retraction of the label of some protesters as “rioters.”
On Friday evening, hundreds of black-clad protesters gathered in the Mong Kok neighborhood and some aimed laser pointers at police officers and set fires in the streets. Riot police sought to disperse the crowds by firing several rounds of tear gas, pepper spray and what appeared to be rubber bullets. Demonstrators, who have accused the company that manages Hong Kong’s subway system of abetting police violence, also vandalized several metro stations.
Elsewhere in the city, hundreds of protesters gathered in a mostly peaceful rally in the city’s central business district chanting slogans like “Reclaim Hong Kong, revolution of our times!” and “Five demands, not one less!”
Public anger toward the police in particular has intensified in recent weeks after officers failed to stop a mob attack on protesters and bystanders at a train station. Police officers across the city are now routinely met with calls of “mafia” and “corrupt cops.”
On Friday, protesters gathered at Prince Edward station in Mong Kok demanding to see security footage from last weekend, when riot officers had charged into a waiting train car, beat four people with batons and doused them in pepper spray.
Human rights groups have criticized the officers’ actions, saying that the people were not offering resistance.
When demonstrators showed up at Prince Edward Station on Friday evening, the authorities stopped train service, prompting protesters to break into the station. The damage they inflicted there and at Mong Kok and Yau Ma Tei stations led authorities to close the three subway stops by late Friday evening.
The protests on Friday were an early test of public sentiment since Carrie Lam announced on Wednesday her four-point plan to ease the tensions that have plunged this former British colony into its worst crisis since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The protests have badly battered Hong Kong’s economy, which sustained another blow on Friday when Fitch Ratings  for the region.
In subsequent remarks on Thursday, Mrs. Lam  not to legitimize “the really violent protesters,” in what some saw as an attempt to sow divisions in the movement.
But many moderate protesters have vowed to maintain a united front, saying that they would only be satisfied once all of the demonstrators’ demands were met.
On Friday evening in Chater Garden, about 1,000 peaceful protesters gathered at a rally where a large statue of a female protester had been erected in the square. The statue was clad in what has become the standard demonstration uniform — hard hat, goggles, gas mask, backpack and umbrella.
Charmaine Cheung, 30, who was among the moderate protesters gathered at the rally in Chater Garden, said the movement’s aims have expanded well beyond the extradition bill. “The problems that have since arisen are much more serious than whether the bill is withdrawn or not,” said Ms. Cheung, a nurse.

South China Morning Post,2019-08-08,meeting protest demands 'will not solve crisis' Beijing's top official overseeing HK affairs likens,814 ,"
Beijing's top official overseeing Hong Kong affairs has denounced the anti-government protests sweeping the city as bearing the ""obvious characteristics of a ­colour revolution"" and warned that the worst crisis since the handover to Chinese sovereignty could not be resolved by bowing to protesters' demands.
Zhang Xiaoming, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), put the emphasis on ending the protest chaos and violence that began two months ago, triggered by the government's now-abandoned extradition bill.
He also left open the possibility of the government setting up a commission of inquiry into the entire extradition bill saga, in response to citywide calls, but only after the protests ended.
""The most pressing and overriding task at present is to stop violence, end the chaos and restore order, so as to safeguard our homeland and prevent Hong Kong from sinking into an abyss,"" Zhang said.
Laying out these priorities before 500 of Hong Kong's top business leaders and pro-Beijing politicians at a seminar in neighbouring Shenzhen yesterday, he called on allies of Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor's embattled government to do their part in safeguarding Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
Speaking at the same event, Wang Zhimin, director of Beijing's liaison office, warned that the crisis gripping Hong Kong was a ""battle of life and death"", with the city's future at stake.
While Beijing officials rallied pro-establishment forces at the day-long seminar, Hong Kong's leader continued to avoid open public engagements, but quietly made a morale-boosting visit to the Tin Shui Wai police station, where tear gas was used to disperse protesters who attacked it on Monday.
Lam also, unannounced, visited the site of a new public market in the district and reviewed ­improvements works at Tai Wai Market. During her first community excursion since the protests erupted in early June, she ­promised to come up with ­measures to improve livelihood in her policy address in October.
At the seminar in Shenzhen, Zhang again declared Beijing's full support for Hong Kong's leader and police force, stressing that backing them was key to ­restoring order.
""The central government is 100 per cent supportive of Lam's leadership,"" he said.
Zhang warned that if the crisis escalated beyond the local government's control, Beijing would not just sit and watch. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) could be deployed to restore law and ­order, while national laws could also apply in a state of emergency.
""According to the Basic Law, the central authorities have ample methods as well as sufficient strength to promptly settle any possible turmoil should it occur,"" he said.
Former Hong Kong justice minister Elsie Leung Oi-sie, who attended the gathering, said: ­""Beijing will not ignore Hong Kong when it is in chaos.""
The seminar in Shenzhen was the first of its kind since the HKMAO and Beijing's liaison ­office in Hong Kong organised a similar event in August 2014, a month before the Occupy protests began and protesters occupied roads for 79 straight days.
""We can say Hong Kong is facing the most serious situation since the [1997] handover,"" Zhang said in his opening remarks over the first five minutes of the seminar during which the media were allowed in.
Ip Kwok-him, a local delegate to the National People's Congress, quoted Zhang as warning that the city would suffer greatly if the protests dragged on, and that they should not be allowed to disrupt celebrations to mark the 70th ­anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
""I believe he was expressing hope that the chaos in Hong Kong would be over by September, but of course, the sooner the better,"" Ip said.
Zhang described the protests as having ""obvious characteristics of a colour revolution,"" in a reference to civil unrest in countries in the former Soviet Union and ­Balkans in the early 2000s.
New People's Party chairwoman Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee cited Zhang as suggesting that such characteristics including the prominent role of youngsters, and the involvement of religious groups.
Another attendee said Zhang had noted how colour revolutions had destroyed police morale.
""Police have sweated and bled, we cannot let them cry,"" Zhang was quoted as saying.
Protesters have made five demands which the government has resisted so far: completely withdraw of the bill that would allow the transfer of fugitives to the mainland; launch an independent inquiry to look into the entire controversy and allegations of ­police brutality in particular; exonerate those arrested; retract all references to protests as ""riots""; and launch the city's stalled political reform process.
Delegates who attended the meeting said Zhang dismissed all the demands, but left open the possibility of setting up a commission of inquiry after order was ­restored.

South China Morning Post,2019-08-19,Peaceful rally suggests new strategy Lack of clashes yesterday seen as sign protesters have learned,551 ,"
Protesters avoided violence ­during yesterday's massive anti-government march, a change of strategy that gave the authorities less room to act against them, ­observers said.
Political scientists and some protesters said the peaceful march was also the result of reflection over their conduct at Hong Kong International Airport last week, which drew a backlash.
Last Tuesday, protesters were criticised for assaulting two mainlanders they believed were undercover agents for Beijing.
The incidents happened on the fifth day of a mass sit-in at the airport, which resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights and inconvenience to thousands of travellers.
Last Wednesday, the protesters admitted they overreacted by attacking the men and apologised for the disruption at the airport.
In the wake of the airport chaos, it was important to keep the protests peaceful, said retail industry worker Tonny Chan, 32.
""The whole world is watching our struggle now and no one likes to see violent clashes,"" he said. ""I also do not want to see our young people giving up their future to defend us.""
Political scientist Ma Ngok of Chinese University said the sheer numbers that turned out yesterday sent a signal to the Hong Kong government and Beijing that ­public opinion had not changed despite last week's events and ­warnings by the central government that some actions of the ­protesters displayed ""signs of ­terrorism"".
John Lee, a 21-year-old ­Chinese University student, said that in light of what happened at the airport, protesters needed to reflect on their strategy.
But an activist who had taken part in rowdy demonstrations said those who advocated a more aggressive approach should still carry on if the movement was to succeed.
""It will only work when peaceful and radical protesters are both allowed to do their thing,"" added the masked man, who said he was in his early 20s and declined to be named. He also said the admission by the police last week that they had sent undercover officers into the protesters' ranks had spooked them and left them feeling their hands were tied.
""Now everyone thinks you are a 'ghost' when you suggest radical ideas,"" he said, using the ­Cantonese term for an infiltrator.
""So it is difficult to convince others to do what we used to.""
Indeed, a suggestion to besiege Beijing's liaison office in Sai Ying Pun was voted down overwhelmingly on the Reddit-like site LIHKG, which has been the virtual command centre of the protest movement.
Ma said the change of strategy was mostly a response to government and police tactics, including the police infiltration of protesters' ranks.
""Protesters know there are a lot of spies among them after what happened last week. They know they shouldn't fall into the trap of the regime, which apparently wants to create violent clashes,"" he said.
Baptist University political academic Dr Edmund Cheng Wai noted the intense discussion on LIHKG over last week's events showed the movement's ""reflective mechanism"" at work.
""What happened at the airport crossed theline even in the eyes of foreign media,"" he said.
He said keeping the protests peaceful would make it difficult for the government to dismiss the movement as violent. But he added that violent clashes might still reoccur. ""It also depends on their interaction with the police,"" he said."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-27,"Opportunity for dialogue may have been lost by inaction, analysts fear",596 ,"
The return of violence to the streets of Hong Kong has analysts observing the protest movement's rotation of violent and peaceful tactics and suggesting the government just missed its best chance yet to start a dialogue with the demonstrators.
Police fired a gunshot on Sunday and deployed two water cannon vehicles - both were firsts after weeks of turmoil. The ­violence dashed hopes the movement would remain peaceful after eight days without tear gas. As analysts observed, the day's ­unrest proved that violence is ­becoming all-too-common - and peace, it seems, an aberration.
Optimism for a period of calm had been high since an estimated 1.7 million people gathered in a peaceful rally on August 18. Some have now said that opportunity has been lost.
""The government has to understand that it is difficult to separate the peaceful protesters and establish a dialogue with them,"" Edmund Cheng Wai, a political scientist at Baptist University, said. ""It was not proactive enough given the rare peaceful weekend after August 18.""
Cheng said radical protesters continued to receive strong ­support. He cited a viral video showing protesters with riot gear being greeted by loud applause from hundreds of residents on Sunday when they passed by New Town Plaza in Sha Tin.
""Radical protesters and peaceful, rational and non-violent protesters are two sides of the same coin in this movement,"" Cheng said. ""The rotation of these two tactics has been evident.""
After the peaceful August 18 rally, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor did not respond directly to the protesters' five ­demands, including a complete withdrawal of the bill and setting up an independent investigation into alleged police brutality.
Lam instead proposed forming a ""platform for dialogue"" and met 19 senior city leaders on ­Saturday at Government House to brainstorm. Cheng said the government moved too slow and provided no blueprint for such a platform.
Ma Ngok, a political scientist at Chinese University, said the alternating cycle of peace and violence would continue, given the government's inaction. He also cited the simmering grievances that erupted after the MTR's interruption of train services and Cathay Pacific's sacking of workers linked to the protests.
He said the protesters were using specific tactics for different protests, with marches held by the Civil Human Rights Front drawing peaceful protesters while the district marches were generally ­allowed to descend into violence.
Ma predicted public opinion would become increasingly ­polarised between protesters and the pro-government camp.
Benny Tai Yiu-ting, who was granted bail after serving about three months in jail for co-founding the Occupy movement in 2014, shared a similar opinion on a radio programme yesterday.
""As long as the peaceful ­protesters fail to achieve their ­demands, there is support for ­radical actions. This is the conclusion of scholars around the world,"" Tai said.
Tai gave a rare sympathetic nod to the police, describing the force as sandwiched between the city's leaders and the public and under enormous pressure.
It will not be a long wait to see which tactic the protesters use next. The front has planned a march on Saturday from Central to Beijing's liaison office in Sai Ying Pun.
The date, August 31, marks the fifth anniversary of Beijing's stringent ""831 Decision"" on Hong Kong's democratic reforms.
Cheng and Ma said the tone of the demonstration would be ­influenced by a range of uncertainties, including future ­comments by Lam and the tactics of police.

South China Morning Post,2019-09-13,police ban rally for fear of more chaos As Civil Human Rights Front plans to lodge appeal ahead of S,596 ,"
Police have banned a mass rally planned for Sunday, the second time the Civil Human Rights Front has been denied permission to hold an anti-government protest over fears of unrest.
The objection - on the grounds there had been ""chaos"", ""violence"", ""road blockages"" and ""destruction"" after previous marches organised by the front - came as Hong Kong braced for citywide protests today.
Demonstrators planned to gather in public parks and climb the iconic Lion Rock and Victoria Peak for ""alternative"" Mid- ­Autumn Festival celebrations.
The MTR Corporation confirmed it would not provide overnight services today for the festival and all stations would close at normal times, although trains would run more often from 3pm.
Protests were also planned for Wong Tai Sin, Kwun Tong, Tuen Mun, Tin Shui Wai and Sai Wan Ho tomorrow, with another bid to jam traffic to the airport reportedly being plotted.
In a letter to the front, police cited heightened safety concerns, saying protesters had committed violent acts, including starting fires, throwing petrol bombs, bricks and steel bars and destroying public property.
The front will file an appeal. Police also banned its march and rally on August 31, giving similar reasons. The force has banned a number of protests in recent weeks, although many went ahead regardless.
Huge crowds defied the ban on August 31, filling the streets of Hong Kong Island. The day ended in violence as mobs started fires and hurled petrol bombs at ­police, who, in turn, used water cannons and multiple rounds of tear gas. There were also clashes at Prince Edward MTR station.
Hong Kong has been gripped by 14 weeks by protests. Beijing has accused protesters of terrorism, colluding with foreign forces and fomenting a ""colour revolution"" against Chinese rule.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor formally withdrew the bill this month but failed to pacify protesters, who have pressed on with other demands, including an independent inquiry into police actions.
Should the front's appeal be shot down, police said they would make a public announcement to ensure people knew that joining the unauthorised protest might entail legal consequences.
Acting assistant district commander of Central Kwok Chun-kit said police would have reserves in ""strategic locations"". He added that police could not give the green light to protests if organisers could not ensure public events would take place peacefully.
The front, an umbrella organisation of pro-democracy groups, has organised huge protests, including the June 9 and 16 marches it estimated had turnouts of 1 million and 2 million respectively.
Front vice-convenor Bonnie Leung Wing-man said: ""The police ban cannot scare away people. It will only make moderate people angry and some may resort to more radical means.""
Earlier yesterday, hundreds of pro-Beijing supporters confronted anti-government protesters at the IFC shopping mall in Central.
One camp waved the national flag and sang the Chinese anthem, while the other sang Glory to Hong Kong - the latest theme song of the protest movement.
The mall was also one of the major sites chosen by protesters for ""singing"" protests last night. Apart from Glory to Hong Kong they chanted anti-government and anti-police slogans. About 2,000 followed suit at Times Square mall in Causeway Bay, while 1,000 swamped the APM mall in Kwun Tong.
Similar protests were staged at Yoho mall in Yuen Long, Maritime Square on Tsing Yi and Dragon Centre in Sham Shui Po, among others.

South China Morning Post,2019-09-12,Boms away_ it's a message to the world A protest poster by a Hong Kong street artist is to be distri,410 ,"
Boms has been run off his feet lately. The Hong Kong street artist and dancer- who does notwant to be identified - has been plastering walls across the city with his ­protest posters, insupport of the anti-government movement of the past three months.
Unlike most of the protest art produced locally during thisperiod, his drawings will alsobe headed for London andAmsterdam, where copies will be distributed to the public andposted around the streets, over the next two months.
The Young Blood Initiative, which was founded by Hongkonger Candy Choi in 2014 to bring together artists from around the world to experiment beyond their usual practice, will be taking Boms' works to Europe.
Boms says he wants hisposters to bring positive energy to people, encouraging them to ""stay and go through anythingtogether"".
He adds: ""I think a poster doesn't mean a lot, but at least this is the [message] that I can help communicate to everyone.""
Hong Kong's summer of protests was sparked by an extradition bill that would have allowed fugitives to be sent to jurisdictions with which the city lacked a treaty, including the mainland.
Last Wednesday, ChiefExecutive Carrie Lam ChengYuet-ngor said she would formally withdraw the bill, meeting one of the ""five key demands"" ofprotesters.
Boms shows his solidarity with the protests through his art. His poster show more than a dozen open umbrellas piled on top of each other, a formation often seen on the front line of protests.Chinese calligraphy in the background reads: ""Hongkongers never give up"", ""The world changes, our original intention never changes"", ""Good and evil will be decided in the end"".
The umbrella has been asymbol of the city's democratic and civil disobedience movement since the 79-day Occupy Central sit-ins of 2014. ""The umbrellais the most iconic object that everyone will use to protect themselves,"" he says.
Under the umbrellas is a tiny bauhinia sapling, Hong Kong's floral emblem, which Bomssays shows ""we're actuallyprotecting our future"". At thebottom, it reads in English: ""Stand with Hong Kong"".
""People in Hong Kong are fighting for justice ... and there have been complaints aboutthe cops,"" says Boms, referring to accusations that authorities have used excessive force duringconfrontations with protesters.
The artist says there is something wrong with the system,but confesses he doesn't have the solution to fix it.
""The only thing we can do is stay together and have our voices heard,"" Boms says."
South China Morning Post,2019-06-28,Carrie Lam makes first public appearance in over a week Lam makes first public appearance in over a,742 ,"
Hong Kong's embattled leader ­resurfaced for the first time in over a week for a morale-boosting ­meeting with police union leaders ­yesterday, following a six-hour siege of the force's headquarters the night before by hundreds of protesters demanding she ­completely withdraw the ­government's now-suspended extradition bill.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor's office issued a statement announcing that she had met the heads of four staff associations representing the city's 30,000 officers at Government House to assure them of her administration's full support and to praise them for showing restraint while under fire from protesters.
""Mrs Lam expressed her heartfelt thanks to members of the force for fulfilling their duties with dedication during the disputes and clashes in society caused by the legislative amendment exercise, striking a balance between the public's freedom of expression and social order, and maintaining law and order in Hong Kong,"" the statement read.
""She said she understands that members of the force and their family members have been put under pressure and that a small number of people even provoked the police intentionally, which is not acceptable.""
The statement was published online with a photograph of Lam that provided the first glimpse of her since June 18, when she apologised for her government's mishandling of the legislation that would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to the mainland and other jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has no extradition deal.
Lam's office also revealed she had met representatives of the education and religious sectors, senior civil servants, foreign diplomats and others over the past few days to explain the situation.
Hours earlier, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung and Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu urged protesters who have targeted police headquarters twice in one week not to vent their anger against the government on law enforcers doing their duty. Cheung also condemned Wednesday night's siege of the Arsenal Street base, saying: ""Hong Kong will absolutely not tolerate any illegal or violent act.""
One protester was arrested and later released, and the identities of 60 others suspected of criminal damage were recorded after the siege ended early yesterday. Protesters vandalised the building front, defaced the outer walls with obscene graffiti and trapped police inside for six hours.
Lee also decried acts of vandalism and harassment at recent protests, as he met the media alongside police chief Stephen Lo Wai-chung at the compound.
The security minister said that while he, the city's leader and the justice chief had apologised for deficiencies in the government's work on the extradition bill, police officers had nothing to do with those failures.
""Even if you are dissatisfied with any [work] of the government, I hope you will not vent it at the police force,"" he said.
The police commissioner added: ""Apart from managing processions and demonstrations, we are serving the people on a daily basis, handling all kinds of cases ranging from murder to traffic accidents.""
The police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Council, also sought to address public concern about recent crowd control operations, with a source saying a special panel would be set up to investigate the recent clashes between frontline officers and protesters.
In anticipation of escalated protests, the Home Affairs Department confirmed the annual flag-raising ceremony to mark Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule on July 1 would be scaled down due to ""security concerns"".
Earlier in the day, more than 100 demonstrators descended on the office of Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah, demanding she withdraw the extradition bill altogether and spare those arrested from prosecution.
The protesters also demanded the retraction of all references to the June 12 clashes as ""rioting"" as well as an independent inquiry into the police's use of force.
Rebecca Johnson, founding president of Nobel Peace Prize-winning organisation International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, visited the protesters and told them: ""What should be yours must be yours, and no government can take that away.""
The Department of Justice (DoJ) dismissed the protesters' demands, stating: ""All investigations are conducted by law ­enforcement agencies which will, after investigation and when ­necessary, refer to the DoJ for ­independent decisions on whether to prosecute."""
South China Morning Post,2019-12-01,Tensions return to streets ahead of major rally today Protesters block roads in Prince Edward as the,764 ,"
Tension returned to Hong Kong's streets last night as the fragile peace of the past two weeks ­wavered, a day before a major anti-government rally was ­expected to take place near the site of recent violent clashes ­between radicals and police.
Protesters blocked roads twice in three hours and forcibly closed exits to Prince Edward MTR station, and police fired pepper balls after a foreign journalist tried to take a picture from the middle of the street. A woman was treated for an eye injury, but the cause of it was not immediately clear. Late last night, a small fire was started at an entrance to Mong Kok MTR.
Earlier in the day, organisers estimated about 1,000 students and elderly people gathered in Central for a peaceful rally. The police put the figure at 650.
Today's march, for which police issued a letter of no objection, will start at the Clock Tower in Tsim Sha Tsui and end at the Coliseum in Hung Hom, near Polytechnic University and the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, the site of a two-week stand-off between protesters and police last month.
The rally will run from 3pm to 6pm, and is the biggest of three gatherings happening today.
Police also approved a morning rally against the use of tear gas, from government headquarters in Admiralty, and another afternoon march from the United States' consulate in Central to ""express gratitude"" to the country for passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.
Yesterday, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, the city's No 2 official, said he hoped the end on Friday of the 13-day police siege of PolyU would mark the return of peace to the city.
But there is uncertainty over how peaceful today's march will be. On LIHKG, a Reddit-like internet forum protesters use to exchange ideas, a self-proclaimed march organiser said he wanted the march to be used to renew the calls for five demands.
""Although we scored a small victory in district councils, let's not forget why we started and return the main theme - Reclaim Hong Kong, Revolution of our times,"" he wrote, adding he set the route to show support to those who fought at PolyU.
At yesterday's rally in Central, Tam Kwok-sun, 64, one of the organisers, said he hoped the event could unite generations and keep the protest movement alive until all their demands had been met.
""I will volunteer to help our councillors understand what citizens think,"" Tam said. ""It's important the neighbourhood is involved in supporting our councillors, not just by voting, but also by actively participating in the community.""
More than 1,000 radical ­protesters and their supporters occupied the PolyU campus a fortnight ago, and engaged in fierce battles with police on November 17. They blocked roads to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel and started fires on nearby bridges.
The force sealed the campus, asking those inside to leave. Those aged 18 or above who left were arrested on suspicion of rioting. About 300 minors had their details taken before being released.
The city has been rocked by protests sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill since June. A total of 5,890 people have been arrested, with around 40 per cent of them students, including 910 under the age of 18.
As night fell yesterday, about 300 residents from Wong Tai Sin district took to the streets with a roast pig and champagne, to celebrate the victory of the pro-democracy camp in their district, after voters in last Sunday's elections flipped all 25 seats in favour of the camp. The participants sang and some council winners took turns to give speeches.
From about 7pm, protesters arrived at Prince Edward station to lay flowers at an entrance to mark an incident on August 31, when riot police violently dispersed people inside the station and in a train.
Protesters' demands include an independent inquiry into police actions during protests. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng ­Yuet-ngor has repeatedly rejected the calls, and said the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) would do the job, even though an overseas expert invited to advise the IPCC has said the mechanism was ineffective.
Lam revealed on Tuesday that ""an independent review committee"", with scholars looking at the underlying causes of the protests, was being set up.
Cheung yesterday said the review committee would cooperate with the IPCC, which will issue an initial report early next year on controversial incidents, including the August 31 incident.
But former housing minister Anthony Cheung Bing-leung said such a committee could not replace a commission of inquiry, which had the power to summon witnesses.

South China Morning Post,2019-11-29,Inside the siege of Polytechnic University After some of the most intense clashes of the social unre,2383 ,"
On November 21, James Wong made his dash for freedom from the wreckage and rotting filth of Polytechnic University in Hung Hom.
He had tried once before to escape, by jumping into a manhole and crawling through the narrow sewers, but gave up when it became too unbearable. ""It was so smelly and dirty,"" he said.
Then, early on November 21, he noticed there were no police guarding the roads near one of the campus buildings.
Wong, 22, a student at a PolyU community college, took off.
""I ran across two highways and through some bushes. I just kept sprinting. I just wanted to get home, have a bath, lie on my bed and put an end to this,"" he said after he escaped.
Wong, not his real name, was at PolyU when the campus became the focal point of some of the worst violence in more than five months of anti-government protests.
The campus siege looked like it was ending this week, as police teams moved into the wrecked campus to remove weapons and hazardous materials and record evidence of destruction and vandalism.
There has been no sign of any protesters still holed up inside, though some could still be hiding in classrooms. A message scrawled across the wall of a building said: ""Some people moved on. But not us.""
PolyU leaders who had appealed since Monday for the blockade to end said the campus was in a state of ""utter chaos"" and a hygiene and health risk.
Earlier this week, there were maggots thriving on the rotting food scraps left in the protester's common kitchen area, and the stench was so bad, a face mask was a must.
The months of social unrest began in June with protests against the now-withdrawn extradition bill that could have led to fugitives being sent to the mainland and other jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has no exchange arrangement.
As the protests grew and became more violent, the clashes between masked radicals and the police remained largely on the city's streets, with damage to businesses, banks, and MTR stations.
Then, the fury moved to university campuses following the death on November 8 of Chow Tsz-lok, an undergraduate at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
He had fallen off the third floor of a car park in Tseung Kwan O while police were clearing protesters nearby, using tear gas. Although the circumstances of his death remain unclear, it triggered a fresh wave of violence, and calls for a citywide strike. Protesters moved into campuses, leading to classes being suspended and graduation ceremonies cancelled.
PolyU was one of the two worst-hit universities, the other being the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). As calls for action to cripple the city went out, protesters descended on the campuses that are both close to important transport arteries.
At CUHK on November 11, the mob dropped objects from a bridge at the university onto Tolo Highway and railway tracks beneath, marking the beginning of a five-day occupation of the campus and clashes. The protesters retreated on November 15.
Over at PolyU, the protesters moved in on November 11 and stayed. The compact campus with its high-rise buildings is in a bustling area of Kowloon, just minutes from the malls and tourist attractions of Tsim Sha Tsui.
It is also close to Hung Hom MTR station and adjacent to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel that links Hung Hom in Kowloon with Causeway Bay on Hong Kong Island and is used by 110,000 motorists daily.
There were unmistakable signs of the trouble to come after masked radicals and their supporters arrived at PolyU and began preparing for battle.
They manned the campus entrance, frisking everyone who entered, searching their bags.
On November 13, the masked radicals managed to shut down the Cross-Harbour Tunnel by setting up barricades, burning toll booths and starting fires in the tunnel itself. The damage was so extensive that the tunnel was shut for two weeks, crippling traffic movement.
More than 1,000 protesters and their supporters, including teenagers, were believed to be inside the campus.
They began making and stockpiling hundreds of petrol bombs. They raided the university's laboratories for hazardous chemicals. They made nail traps to place on nearby roads, to puncture the tyres of vehicles that came too near.
At the university's pristine 50-metre outdoor swimming pool, masked radicals practised lighting and throwing fuel-filled bottles. The petrol bombs turned the pool into a blackened pit, as the stink of motor oil and lighter fluid filled the air.
Elsewhere, some in the group practised shooting bows and arrows.
On Sunday, November 17, the situation escalated swiftly from morning, after about 100 people, mostly middle aged, arrived and began clearing the road near the campus of barricades and debris left by the protesters. These volunteers came under attack, with bricks raining down on them, and at least two were taken to hospital bleeding.
The riot police arrived, bringing two armoured vehicles and water cannons. In the pitched battle that followed, the mob hurled numerous petrol bombs at the police, shot arrows from rooftop perches and sometimes used catapults.
As night fell, the campus was no less than a war zone. An armoured vehicle was set ablaze, and an officer was pierced in the calf by an arrow. Footbridges were set on fire as the mob tried to block officers from coming their way. The police responded with tear gas that engulfed the campus, as well as two water cannons which splashed the protesters with blue dye.
That day, the police sealed all exits of the campus, and ordered everyone inside PolyU to leave or risk being arrested for taking part in a riot. There was only one way out, via Block Y of the Lee Shau Kee Building, which was manned by the police.
For the next 11 days, the police waited outside the campus while those inside decided their next moves.
About 1,100 came out in the days that followed. Those aged 18 and above were arrested, while minors had their details recorded, although the police reserved the right to arrest them later.
But an untold number remained inside, with estimates of hundreds initially. By early this week, only dozens were still believed to be in hiding there.
At one point, the campus gymnasium was a common sleeping area. Hundreds of mats, and all kinds of items from food to drinks and other rubbish was found there.
After the siege began, few remained there, as people went off to find their own rest areas in classrooms alone or in ""squads"" of four or five.
A 24-year-old construction worker, calling himself K, said his squad of four would scour the campus looking for food and bottled water. Some protesters apparently had hoarded their own supplies.
K said he survived mainly on biscuits during the six days he remained there after the police blockade began,
As the days went by, he noticed some protesters looking disoriented.
""They were glassy-eyed, with messy hair, and looked very frustrated,"" he said. ""They gave incoherent answers when you spoke to them and would not make eye contact.""
His squad tried every day to find ways to flee, sleeping barely two hours a day. They followed suggestions of numerous escape routes posted on the popular Telegram messaging app, but none worked.
""Every time we arrived, there were already about 30 people ahead of us. It was quite frustrating,"" he said. He was so exhausted, he said, that he fell off a chair while napping one day, and broke two teeth. He finally left by calling for an ambulance. The police recorded his details, but did not arrest him.
Frontline radical Ah Sei, 24, tried but failed to escape. He was waiting his turn in a big group, many of whom got away by abseiling seven metres down a campus footbridge by rope to flee on waiting motorcycles.
But the riot police arrived and fired tear gas. ""There were too many people waiting and they had to go down one by one,"" he said.
He tried escaping through the sewers three times, but failed. ""Even though we were wearing masks, the smell was overpowering,"" he said.
On Thursday last week, he left by ambulance. The police recorded his personal information and he was sent to hospital. He said that afterwards, he treated himself to a big Japanese buffet. ""At last, I don't have to eat cup noodles or biscuits anymore,"" he said.
Chinese University accountancy student Edward, 22, went to PolyU on November 17 and became part of the team manning the kitchen that prepared meals for others.
Last week, he was still inside and struggling to decide whether to surrender. He said he had trouble sleeping at night and was afraid of being arrested. He even had dreams of being arrested on the street, he said.
Edward said he did not want to go to jail because he felt he had done nothing that could be described as close to rioting. It is not known what he decided.
First-aid volunteer Michael Wong, 20, said he treated injured protesters but left the campus the day after the siege with former Legislative Council president Jasper Tsang Yok-sing, who went there to help.
Although he felt bad about leaving, he felt it might have been dangerous to stay. Wong, not his real name, was arrested, but has not been charged yet. ""This really was not a game,"" said Wong. ""What happened at Poly U was a war, a revolution.""
Among those inside the campus was social worker Hui Lai-ming, director of the Social Workers' General Union, who said she remained for several days after the siege began because there were too many people who needed help.
""Many were feeling very lost and I felt obliged to help. Among those holed up inside were parents looking for their children,"" Hui said.
""There was a father who came looking for his son. He found his child, but the son refused to go home. The father teared up as we spoke.""
Hui was arrested during a protest in Admiralty in September and was charged with one count of assaulting a police officer. But she said she continued attending protests, to be available to those who needed help.
She left with medical sector lawmaker Dr Pierre Chan, who arrived to help those still inside. Police took down Hui's personal information and let her go.
She said she heard of other social workers who were arrested, but this could not be confirmed. There was also talk of medical workers being arrested, even though they had gone in to treat injured protesters, but the number could not be confirmed.
Another social worker, PolyU graduate Anson Choy, went into the campus three days after the siege began, with other social workers, politicians and school principals to speak to those remaining inside and ask them to leave. Choy, 38, said she did not go in to persuade anyone to leave, but to console them. ""We wanted to know if they were exhausted, if they felt hopeless, and whether they were hurt,"" she said.
Asked about social workers being arrested, Secretary for Labour and Welfare Dr Law Chi-kwong said yesterday that the law did not give social workers special powers to carry out their duties during violent confrontations.
""For example, during gang fights that involve teenagers, outreach social workers would not intervene to stop the fight. That's not the work of social workers,"" he said.
Outside the PolyU campus, the police remained waiting, with no indication that they intended raiding the campus.
As the district council elections approached, an unusual calm settled over Hong Kong, as protesters stayed off the streets.
The polls went ahead peacefully, with a record turnout and a thumping win for pan-democrats.
On Monday, there was a flurry of activity from PolyU's leadership, which issued multiple statements calling for the end of the police blockade and saying the chaos on campus was unbearable and had to end.
The police said they were ready with a ""safety team"" to enter the campus, but the university preferred to conduct a search of the premises with its own team.
The university was concerned about extensive damage to its buildings, and the dangerous substances, petrol bombs and litter scattered all over its open areas.
Teams assembled by PolyU conducted two days of searches, claiming they went room by room, floor by floor of all buildings, only to find no protesters aside from one young woman. She was found on Tuesday night but after speaking to a counsellor, wandered off and the university did not know what became of her.
Finally, yesterday, the police moved in, signalling that the siege of PolyU was near its end.
There are questions that remain about those who got away, as well as some of those who were arrested.
Pastor Roy Chan Hoi-hing lamented that 59 volunteers from ""Protect the Children"", a group he started in July to look out for the welfare of the youngest protesters, were arrested.
His volunteers include middle-aged people, housewives, and those from middle-class backgrounds, and he was not with the 59 who went to PolyU on November 17 to help cook meals, clean up the mess and wash tear gas off protesters. Chan said they were all arrested, and some had been charged. He declined to give more details, but said: ""Our volunteers were doing humanitarian work and should not have been arrested.""
PolyU student Jonathan Wong, 20, escaped arrest, after remaining on campus for five days while the police blockade was on. He said he slept very little, ate biscuits, packaged snacks and cup noodles, and did not shower or change his clothes all that time.
Holed up in a classroom with five others, some of whom he had met only after November 17, he spent most of his time checking Telegram and other chat groups for ways to escape.
Wong said he went from being a peaceful protester in June to one of those throwing petrol bombs and bricks at the police during the PolyU clashes because he felt the authorities had not listened to the protesters' demands.
In the end, he and five others escaped through the sewers, wearing gas masks and wading in knee-deep water for 20 minutes.
""We emerged later on a quiet street in Hung Hom, where a manhole cover was open. No police were there, only four supporters who helped us and drove me home,"" Wong said.
He said he had no regrets participating in the occupation of PolyU, because the protesters' actions had put ""maximum pressure"" on the government and set the momentum for the pan-democrat camp's landslide victory at the district council elections last Sunday.
""But we also sustained heavy losses in terms of comrades arrested and morale crushed,"" he said."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-18,Don't expect any help from Trump in the protest crisis JUST SAYING Yonden Lhatoo dismisses the idea,632 ,"
A reader from the United States made quite an interesting point in a letter he sent me upon seeing protesters regularly waving American flags at anti-government rallies in Hong Kong.
""I must say, seeing the star-spangled banner fly in your city gives me complicated feelings. On the one hand, apparently it is still regarded by you as a symbol of freedom, despite the little crisis this country is currently going through,"" he wrote.
""Great. But on the other hand, I am not sure it's showing up in the right place at the right time for the right reasons. Hong Kong is, in my opinion, as free as it can be if freedom means throwing whatever you want at the police. Try that in the US. If you throw a Molotov cocktail, be prepared to be greeted with bullets. Real bullets.""
The Iwo Jima-style raising of American flags at these gatherings may be more about trolling Beijing than treachery, but they're also designed to grab the attention of US politicians in the hope that they will support the protest movement and censure the Hong Kong government. And it's working.
Americans are watching and saying, ""Wow, they sure do love us down there."" One of them just happens to be US President Donald Trump.
He's been commenting rather frequently on the protests, with global news coverage escalating in tandem with the intensity and impact of the civil unrest sweeping the city.
""Everyone should be calm and safe!"" Trump tweeted on Wednesday, citing US intelligence reports of a mass build-up of Chinese troops across the border from Hong Kong in Shenzhen.
How does that help? What he obviously doesn't know is that the tough posturing on the other side of the border is more of a warning than a sign that a big crackdown is imminent, and Hong Kong is still a long way off from anything like martial law. The protests have not reached that level yet for Beijing to take such a draconian step, and the full strength and potential of the city's own police force has not even been unleashed yet for fear of bloodshed.
Then Trump seemed to offer to play a mediating role in the crisis, tweeting, ""I have ZERO doubt that if President Xi [Jinping] wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem, he can do it. Personal meeting?""
The absurdity of Trump as deal maker to extract us from this black hole had barely registered when he offered a clarification with an even more bizarre proposition, tweeting: ""If President Xi would meet directly and personally with the protesters, there would be a happy and enlightened ending to the Hong Kong problem.""
He went on to declare that if Xi sat down with the protesters, ""I'd bet he'd work it out in 15 minutes.""
If only that were that simple, even if this mighty meeting were to happen, which it never will. It's clear that Trump hasn't the foggiest about what's happening in Hong Kong, let alone the complexities of its relationship with the mainland. And the last thing we need is ill-informed, misleading, confusing commentary coming from the likes of him.
All those bearers of the star-spangled banner out on our streets may also do well to remember that just back in June, the ever-mercurial Trump told Xi over the phone that he would not condemn any possible crackdown on Hong Kong by Beijing as he accepted this was an internal matter for China.
His priority is his great trade war with China, not Hong Kong's little hissy fit by comparison.
Back to that American reader, who goes on to convey a final message to the protesters: ""I suspect some of you might say, 'If things go south, I will go to the US.' If you are one of those mask-wearing, stick-wielding and brick-throwing protesters, you are not welcome here.""
Do you hear the cognitive dissonance at the protests? Or is it drowned by the people singing?

South China Morning Post,2019-08-18,Sigh of relief on a saturday night without tear gas No canisters fired despite tense stand-off in Mo,893 ,"
Hong Kong breathed a collective sigh of relief yesterday as it marked the eleventh consecutive weekend of protests on a relatively peaceful note marred only by a tense stand-off but with no tear gas fired as masked demonstrators called it an early night.
While protesters and police appeared at times to be on the brink of a clash in Mong Kok, in the end, nothing came of their confrontation. Instead, officers retreated as the demonstrators backed off and bid each other goodbye, chanting galvanising slogans about regrouping today.
""Eight. 18 [August 18], meet in Victoria Park!"" they shouted about their planned afternoon rally at Causeway Bay.
By 8pm, the protesters, who appeared to be in visibly smaller numbers than a week ago, were nowhere to be seen on the streets. Some disappeared into Yau Ma Tei MTR station as others melted into the crowd in a shopping mall.
The day began with a teachers' rally amid an amber rainstorm. Attended by 22,000 protesters, according to the organiser, the Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union, the rally heard speeches on the theme of ""Safeguard the next generation, let our conscience speak"". Participants then marched peacefully from Chater Garden to Government House.
In the afternoon, reflecting the divide in society, anti-government protesters took to the streets on one side of the harbour in Hung Hom while on the other side, on Hong Kong Island, a pro-government rally with the Who's Who of the property world in attendance gave their backing to the embattled administration.
""We condemn the violent acts by black-clad protesters armed with bricks and sticks,"" said Ng Chau-pei of the Safeguard Hong Kong Alliance, the coalition of pro-government politicians and business leaders behind the event at Tamar Park. Organisers said 476,000 people attended the rally, which was punctuated with singing and waving of the national flag. Police estimated the crowd at 108,000 at its peak.
Over on the city's Kowloon side, organisers of the anti-government march said 10,000 people attended the start but only an estimated 2,000 marched to the end point. Police gave the figure of 3,500 at the start of the rally.
Speculation had mounted that given the escalating violence of the past weeks, police might not only increase their presence but also be ready to deploy their latest weapon, the much-talked about water cannons.
But there was no such need as protesters decided to scale down their radical actions, a deliberate move not to alienate the public after the violence and chaos during their airport demonstrations earlier in the week had upset people, according to several of them.
After their march from To Kwa Wan to Hung Hom in mid-afternoon, it did appear at first as if tensions would once again lead to clashes with police as both sides began falling into a predictable pattern of actions.
As soon as the approved march ended, protesters splintered off and several hundred made their way to Mong Kok Police Station. At the station, protesters began pointing laser beams at the police officers bearing shields and threw eggs at them.
A sizeable riot police contingent then appeared and began moving in, making repeated announcements warning protesters and bystanders to disperse.
Protesters then began a cat-and-mouse game with police, moving around several streets as they made their way to Yau Ma Tei and Jordan. At one point, they took over a stretch of the southbound lane on Nathan Road near Mong Kok, putting up makeshift barriers of traffic cones, rubbish bins and small wooden stands.
Many shops along the route had closed their doors amid fears that there would be similar scenes of violence and tear gas that the city had witnessed over the past two months, nearly always after the end of rallies and marches.
As the police moved in along Nathan Road with shields and batons, protesters ran away, and fled into neighbouring Sai Yeung Choi Street South, and Mong Kok Road. Some began throwing rubbish bins onto the road from a footbridge, with one hitting a ­police vehicle.
A police officer in riot gear then pointed his weapon towards the footbridge, firing at least one shot. No police warning flag was displayed and at least one beanbag round was found on the road.
Soon after, the protesters began dispersing. By 7.50pm, riot police vehicles moved in, swept up their men in gear and by 8pm, the last protesters were gone.
""Only around 200 of us stayed behind tonight. We were outnumbered and it is good to deploy the tactics of 'be water',"" a protester at the scene said, repeating the mantra of the movement borrowed from the late martial arts actor Bruce Lee.
Lawmaker Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung, who had attended multiple protests, said protesters wanted a reprieve after the bloody clashes of last Sunday. ""Many were badly hurt and arrested last Sunday. It was a bitter battle,"" he said. ""After that, many have hoped for a morale boost from a massive peaceful rally [today].""
He said frontline protesters wanted to avoid getting injured or arrested yesterday. Since June, more than 700 people have been arrested.
A government spokesperson issued a statement late last night regarding yesterday's protest saying that ""the illegal activities challenged Hong Kong's rule of law, affecting the peace of the society and they must be condemned"".

South China Morning Post,2019-09-06,Unions demand police protection for MTR staff Urgent appeal after off-duty station supervisor assaul,683 ,"
Workers' unions at the MTR ­Corporation have called on the government to deploy extra ­police at every station to protect staff, like it did for citywide strikes earlier this week.
The Hong Kong Federation of Railway Trade Unions made the urgent appeal after an off-duty supervisor at Po Lam station was attacked by anti-government ­protesters in the early hours of yesterday.
The incident signalled an ­escalation in the protesters' ­actions against MTR Corp, which it has accused of siding with police during the ongoing civil unrest.
Police had to rescue the man, who was taken to hospital with injuries to his hands and neck. The rail operator shut the station after officers had cleared protesters, who also vandalised ticket machines and entry gates.
""This is the first time an MTR employee has been physically ­attacked by the protesters,"" Tam Kin-chiu, the union's vice-chairman, said. ""This is unacceptable and we are all angry about it.""
In a statement, the MTR Corp condemned the violence and vandalism, calling on the public not to vent their anger on its staff.
""The MTR expresses anger about our worker being attacked, with station facilities being damaged. We strongly condemn all violent acts,"" it said
The incident happened hours after the city's embattled leader, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, announced the formal withdrawal of the extradition bill that sparked months of protest in the city.
But with Lam only acceding to one of the demonstrators' five ­demands, protesters and politicians from both sides of the divide said it was too little, too late.
""It seems that Lam's concession hasn't had any effect on softening tensions, therefore we urge the government and the MTR Corp to get tougher on the protesters to safeguard staff, including deploying more police at every station, like they did for this week's citywide strike,"" Tam said.
In recent weeks, the rail giant has had its services disrupted and stations vandalised. Over the weekend, more than 40 stations - amounting to more than 40 per cent of the city's heavy rail stations - were severely damaged.
Critics said the rail operator only started to get tough on the protest movement because of pressure from Beijing.
The MTR Corp has obtained an injunction to prevent interference in its operations, and made ad hoc arrangements to suspend services and close stations ­because of protests or rallies.
Protesters have stepped up their attempts to cripple rail networks by damaging station facilities including security cameras, ticket machines, glass doors, turnstiles and station control rooms. Last weekend, some threw objects onto the tracks, causing the suspension of several lines, and also set off fire extinguishers.
The pro-Beijing union submitted a petition to Lam yesterday, with representatives including lawmaker Michael Luk Chung-hung meeting senior ­officials from the Transport and Housing Bureau.
Tam noted radical protesters also used various tricks to frustrate rail operations, such as applying glue to Octopus sensors at turnstiles, hanging objects on the overhead cables to stop the trains, and pointing lasers at drivers.
However, what the staff and the rail giant feared most was hard objects being thrown onto the tracks, he said. ""This is highly dangerous. Objects on the tracks may cause a moving train to derail and even overturn. This is the biggest concern,"" he said.
The MTR Corp has enhanced provision of protective gear, such as goggles and masks, and has also installed protective layers to strengthen glass doors and windows. Tam said the MTR had already instructed staff to avoid getting into any confrontations.
However, a driver who wished to remain anonymous accused the rail operator of siding with police, and said it was to blame for exposing frontline staff to danger.
""So far the MTR has only thanked the police, but it never mentioned the injured passengers,"" he said. ""It is also trying to evade responsibility by refusing to make public the CCTV footage of Prince Edward station on August 31 and the Yuen Long station gang attack on July 21.""

South China Morning Post,2019-07-28,"anger, tear gas and chaos A third weekend of violence as tens of thousands march in protest at last",948 ,"
For three consecutive weekends, police have forcibly dispersed ­angry crowds as anti-government protests triggered by the now-suspended extradition bill rage on.
In the northern town of Yuen Long yesterday, riot police fired tear gas and sponge grenades and used pepper spray and batons to drive back protesters, who responded with umbrellas, sticks and projectiles.
The latest rally came after an armed mob attacked anti-government protesters and passers-by in the area last weekend, injuring at least 45 people.
Yesterday's chaotic scenes - broadcast live around the world - lasted well into the night. As of 11pm, 17 people had been injured, with two in serious condition. Police also arrested a number of people.
Earlier in the day, tens of thousands of protesters, in clear defiance of a police ban, took to the streets of Yuen Long, where thugs in white T-shirts had chased protesters, journalists and commuters inside the MTR station and beat them with iron bars and sticks last Sunday.
The rampage shocked Hong Kong, giving momentum to the unprecedented protests since early June over the extradition bill, which would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions including the mainland, where critics say there is no guarantee of a fair trial.
Many suspected the attackers in white were paid gangsters or ­local villagers from Yuen Long. Police confirmed last week that suspected triad members were among 12 people arrested in connection with the mob violence.
At least three groups had applied to hold protests in the town to condemn the assaults.
Fearing an escalation of the violence, police made the rare decision to reject the applications, but the demonstration still went ahead. Max Chung Kin-ping, one of the organisers, said 288,000 people turned out for the protest. Police did not give an estimate.
Textbook editor Firo Ng, 25, was among those marching. ""I am here to say we are not afraid of the white-clad attackers,"" Ng said.
She also called for an independent inquiry into police actions over the past month.
Fresh graduate Brandon Chan, 22, who joined the Yuen Long march as well as earlier ­major protests against the extradition bill, said he was taking part to show that ""we can't forgo our freedom of assembly and rights"" ­because of fears about triad ­members.
The protesters were also angry about the delayed response from police after the attacks were reported on Sunday evening, and criticised the lack of arrests at the scene.
Mostly dressed in black and many wearing heavy masks, the protesters began streaming into Yuen Long in the afternoon. There was no clear leader and the protest was largely peaceful when the march began at about 3.30pm.
In the crowd was Leonard Cheng Kwok-hon, president of Lingnan University.
Cheng said he was there as an ""observer"" because he was worried about the dangers facing students and staff attending the demonstration.
""Under these circumstances, the students have asked me to come to Yuen Long as an observer of today's events,"" he said.
""As the president, what I care about the most is the safety of our students, teachers and alumni.
""Today I'm not here to protest or march, I'm here because many of our teachers, students and alumni are here, so I'm here to understand the situation.""
One of the enduring images during the Occupy movement in 2014 was when the heads of the city's two leading universities visited the pro-democracy protesters, urging them to avoid conflict and stay peaceful.
But Cheng's presence did not have the same impact. The demonstrators were becoming increasingly agitated, and police bore the brunt of their anger.
Water-filled barricades outside Yuen Long police station were turned into a ""Lennon Wall"" where anti-government and anti-police messages were posted. The tension was most palpable outside the walled village of Nam Pin Wai, where scores of men dressed in white were seen last weekend after the attacks, leading many people to believe some of them lived there.
""Gangsters, come out and put up a fight,"" protesters shouted near the village.
Within Nam Pin Wai, villagers were seen wearing helmets and masks, guarding their ancestral hall and other properties. The two groups were kept separated by fully armed riot police.
The stand-off lasted until late afternoon. As tempers frayed on both sides, some protesters threw bricks at officers. A police van was also besieged and vandalised, but the officers inside were not ­injured.
Police later said this prompted them to take action, because their officers were at risk. The black banner warning protesters to disperse or face the use of force was unfurled at 5.17pm, and officers fired tear gas into the crowd three minutes later.
The now-familiar scene of ­police and protesters scuffling followed, as a city that until a month ago was known for its safety and order again descended into chaos.
A small group of social workers, lawmakers and others tried to step in and put a stop to the clashes, but were unsuccessful. When some urged police not to fire sponge grenades directly at the protesters, officers shouted back: ""They're throwing bricks at us!""
Most of the protesters left at nightfall but a few hundred stayed and continued to battle officers near entrances to Yuen Long station, including using fire extinguishers and water hoses to spray police.
Officers from the elite Special Tactical Squad moved into the station, making arrests and using batons on some protesters. Blood could be seen on the floor.
As the chaos continued well into the night, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and the city's senior officials were nowhere to be seen - and the summer of discontent rolled on.

South China Morning Post,2019-08-27,mtr closures 'expose commuters to danger' Critics say suspending service ahead of protests will only,737 ,"
The MTR Corporation exposed passengers to danger and risked damaging the city's economy with its unprecedented service cuts of up to 1½ hours ahead of ­protests, a commuter group said.
The rail giant came under fire for stopping services or closing stations on the Kwun Tong, Tsuen Wan and West Rail lines because of anti-government demonstrations over the weekend.
Critics warned besides inconveniencing commuters, the move would stir up further ­unrest if it became the norm for the MTR Corp to suppress protests, as some suggested the company was doing.
But others defended the railway operator, with ministers saying the decision was made with government and police to protect staff and passengers from harm.
Quentin Cheng Hin-kei, spokesman for the commuter concern group, Public Transport Research Team, said MTR bosses had forced passengers into ­life-threatening situations. ""This move would embroil innocent passengers who just want to have a train service,"" he said.
""Now because of station closures, they were forced to walk on the streets and risk being beaten up or exposed to tear gas fired by police, as they might be mistaken for anti-government protesters.""
On Saturday at about 10.30am, the rail firm announced its ­decision to suspend train services between Choi Hung and Tiu Keng Leng stations, and close stations between Kowloon Bay and Lam Tin, from noon until ­further ­notice to ensure the ""safety of ­passengers and staff"", before an approved march from 1.30pm in Kwun Tong.
On Sunday at 11.30am, it closed Kwai Fong, Tsuen Wan and Tsuen Wan West stations from 1.30pm onwards because of a protest starting at 3pm in the district.
The service suspensions came a day after the rail giant obtained an injunction to restrain people from unlawfully and wilfully obstructing or interfering with the proper use of stations and trains.
It also said train services might be stopped and stations closed with little or no ­notice if fights, vandalism, acts of violence or high-risk or emergency situations broke out.
The MTR Corp apparently bowed to pressure from Beijing to take a tougher line on protesters after mainland state media warned the firm against any attempt to facilitate ""rioters"", ­saying the operator ran the risk of ""derailing and slipping into the abyss"" if it did so.
Branding the MTR Corp ""irresponsible"", Cheng said: ""I can accept the MTR had to close one station out of safety concerns. But we are talking about four stations in a row. How can you ask the ­passengers to find other means of ­transport? Even under typhoon signal No 8, it would still cater for our commuting needs.
""What is totally unacceptable is the fact the MTR stopped the service for passengers but ­arranged special trains to carry police. Serving police is not the MTR's role,"" Cheng said.
Transport minister Frank Chan Fan denied the MTR's decision to close the stations had anything to do with pressure from Beijing.
""Due to the recent incidents at the stations in Tai Koo, Yuen Long and Kwai Fong, we are of the view the personal safety of the passengers and staff has been threatened ... so we made this decision,"" he added.
He said police were provided with special trains on Saturday because many roads had been blocked by the protesters.
Kwun Tong district councillor Cheng Keng-ieong, of the ­Democratic Party, suspected the MTR's motive was to shift the blame for service disruption onto protesters.
But he said the move by the rail giant had backfired. ""The residents were only forced to join the protesters to walk on the streets. Some of them became very angry and may blame the police for causing them trouble,"" he said.
Lawmaker Michael Tien Puk-sun said closing services could ­reduce the possibility of conflict, adding he believed police manpower was insufficient to maintain law and order at the stations.
""Some MTR stations have been besieged with staff there receiving threats and verbal abuse from protesters. If the police force couldn't provide sufficient manpower to protect the staff there, you can't expect the staff to face the protesters by themselves,"" Tien said.
Hong Kong Federation of Railway Trade Unions vice-chairman Tam Kin-chiu supported the MTR's decision.
""On many occasions, peaceful protests turned into violent ones in the end because of some radical protesters, and they have caused safety concerns for frontline staff,"" he said. ""We agree that safety is more important than providing service."""
South China Morning Post,2019-10-27,"Police to re-employ 1,000 retired officers Plan by force seeks to combat huge strain on manpower ami",460 ,"
Hong Kong's embattled police force plans to re-employ up to 1,000 retired officers to ease the pressure on serving personnel who have been stretched to the limit by well over four months of protest chaos and violence, sources have told the Post.
A senior police source said the boost would be the biggest of its kind since the force started ­bringing officers out of ­retirement in August to cope with the severe strain on manpower.
""The posting of the recruited ex-officers will not be limited to [jobs such as] sweeping security camera footage, but will be ­arranged according to our operational needs,"" the source said.
""They could be put on the front lines to deal with protesters if needed, depending on their skills and experience.""
The 30,000-strong force was still waiting for government ­funding to press ahead with the recruitment drive, the source said, while some 20 retired officers hired earlier would be expected to resume work next month.
According to internal notes obtained by the Post, the force plans to issue vacancy notices in early November, and the selection and vetting process will start by the end of the month.
There will be about 2,000 retired or retiring officers, ranking from constables to chief inspectors, by the end of March next year. The force wants to rehire half of them, and have them return to duty by the end of that month.
Rehired personnel who pass a medical exam will be put on contracts of up to 2½ years, and work 48-hour weeks.
Those who are equipped with special skills may be attached to the Security Wing or Cyber ­Security and Technology Crime Bureau, depending on the needs of those units.
The recruitment is possible under the Post-retirement Service Contract Scheme launched by the Civil Service Bureau in 2015, which affords departments flexibility to adjust their staffing levels.
Police have struggled to keep up with protesters' hit-and-run tactics, as the public backlash against the now-withdrawn extradition bill has snowballed into a wider anti-government movement that is frequently punctuated by violence.
Radicals on the front lines of the protests have rioted, blocked roads, started fires, hurled petrol bombs and vandalised MTR stations, banks, shops and restaurants linked to mainland business interests.
Police officers, in turn, have been accused of brutalising ­protesters, having fired more than 5,000 rounds of tear gas and ­arrested nearly 2,700 people so far.
In August, police brought ­former deputy commissioner Alan Lau Yip-shing out of retirement in a surprise move to tackle the escalating protests.
Lau, a veteran with a tough reputation, was appointed as a deputy commissioner on special duty to ""enhance strategic command and oversee public order events"".

South China Morning Post,2019-08-06,"day of total chaos for commuters Flashpoints Protesters and workers bring city to a standstill, with",608 ,"
Hong Kong commuters yesterday woke up to what was believed to be the worst transport chaos since the 2014 Occupy movement, bringing the city to a standstill, with all MTR lines coming to a full or partial halt, a cross-harbour tunnel shut down, several key roads blocked and hundreds of flights cancelled.
The first signs of MTR service disruption emerged as early as 7.30am at four key stations and interchanges when groups of anti-government protesters, mostly wearing masks and dressed in black, poured onto platforms and blocked train doors, triggering heated verbal ­exchanges with commuters.
At Fortress Hill MTR station on the Island line, rescuers were called in after a pregnant woman fell sick around 8am.
Her husband shouted: ""Ambulance! Police! My wife is about to give birth!""
He then shouted at protesters: ""You are messing up Hong Kong. You always ask the government to reflect. You should reflect on yourselves first.""
There were also reports of minor scuffles between commuters and protesters at some stations. Around 8.20am at Lai King station on the Tsuen Wan line, a protester blocking a train door was shoved off the train. MTR services resumed at about 12.45pm. And there was no news of service disruption on the high-speed cross-border rail at press time.
Part of an escalating anti-government movement that started off with protests two months ago against the now-shelved extradition bill, yesterday's so-called ""uncooperative campaign"" was aimed more at preventing people from going to work.
Among the main demands of protesters are the complete withdrawal of the bill and an independent investigation into police's handling of the demonstrations.
A group of protesters forming a flash mob also shut down the Cross-Harbour Tunnel in Hung Hom, blocking roads using plastic barricades at about 7.30am. ­Police rushed in to clear the area, but the blockade had already ­resulted in traffic jams.
At the airport, air traffic controllers called in sick en masse, ­affecting flight departures and ­arrivals.
""We advise passengers to contact their airlines first, and to proceed to the airport only when their seats and flight times have been confirmed,"" an Airport Authority spokesman said in a statement.
""The Airport Emergency Centre has been activated at 7am to coordinate operations among various business partners. Airport operations continue to be orderly. Flight movements are likely to be increased gradually from the afternoon.""
In-town check-in services at Airport Express stations were also suspended.
Filipino domestic helpers - Angiels Rondalas, 67, and her friend Amelia Quia - arrived at the airport five hours in advance for their 1pm flight to Manila to avoid any disruption, only to find it had been cancelled.
""I have been in Hong Kong for the 30 years, but have never seen anything like this. Now I don't leave the house to be safe, even during vacations,"" Rondalas said.
But just getting to the airport proved to be a challenge for some in the morning, with protesters forcing the Airport Express train service to be suspended briefly.
Taxi drivers seemed to be benefiting from the transport paralysis. Leung Tat-chong, who is a member of the Motor Transport Workers General Union, said some of his fellow cabbies reported a 30 per cent boost in business during the morning rush hours.
""The road blockades were not a major concern. Experienced drivers know the shortest alternative routes to take passengers to their destinations,"" Leung said. ""I just don't want to accidentally enter a protest area and get trapped. The protests have become very fluid. Road barriers could be set up anywhere all of a sudden without any warning."""
South China Morning Post,2019-07-02,Journalists must not be targets of attacks,362 ,"
Journalists covering recent protests in Hong Kong have had a difficult and, at times, dangerous duty to perform. The role they play in ensuring the public receives accurate information about the demonstrations is of great importance. But some frontline members of the media have been subjected to appalling attacks, abuse, and harassment while working. Such conduct is to be condemned.
Reporters from several news organisations, including the South China Morning Post, were insulted, spat at, kicked and splashed with mud by demonstrators at a pro-police rally on Sunday. Some faced foul-mouthed abuse, and others were obstructed in their work. One woman was arrested for assaulting two journalists.
Last week, a TVB cameraman was harassed, insulted and booed by demonstrators on the other side of the political divide. Protesters against a controversial extradition bill verbally abused him, tried to block his lens and shone a flashlight into his eyes.
The actions of the protesters involved are disgraceful. The political climate in Hong Kong amid the protests is febrile. Demonstrators appear to have been motivated by perceptions of whether journalists and their media organisations are on one side of the extradition debate or the other. But the media are just doing their job. There is no excuse for demonstrators to take their frustrations out on journalists.
Formal complaints have also been made about police treatment of journalists during clashes on June 12. Some reporters alleged being tear-gassed, struck with batons, and obstructed while identifying themselves as journalists. Police and media representatives have since met to discuss better handling in future.
Journalists have a responsibility to act professionally while covering the protests. They should take care not to put themselves in unnecessary danger. But all concerned in the protests must ensure the media have the safe and secure access needed to properly cover the events and to keep the public informed. At a time of so much rumour and misinformation on social media, society needs responsible and accurate reporting more than ever. Attacks on journalists covering the protests cannot be tolerated."
South China Morning Post,2019-07-12,Protesters chase head of district council Chairman who ended meeting early had to be escorted by pol,361 ,"
The head of a district council was forced to abruptly adjourn a meeting yesterday before being chased by protesters to the ­nearest ­railway station after he shot down a motion to discuss the unpopular ­extradition bill.
Chris Ip Ngo-tung, of the pro-government Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, was escorted by ­police to Mong Kok East station when he ended the Yau Tsim Mong District Council meeting after only 30 minutes.
The confrontation was caused by Ip's refusal to let three pro-democracy district councillors table a motion urging the government to scrap the bill and set up an independent probe into police conduct during clashes between officers and protesters on June 12.
Andy Yu Tak-po, a member of the Civic Party, said he filed the motion in accordance with the council's rule of giving 10 days' notice. But Ip said the bill was ­beyond the scope of district-level work, and rejected the motion.
Yu argued the council had in the past discussed larger issues such as universal suffrage.
Before the 2.30pm meeting, about 20 protesters waited outside Mong Kok government offices to intercept Ip before he entered the building.
They brought placards that mocked Ip, including one that showed his face on a turtle's body. ""Ip is a turtle hiding in his shell,"" the sign read.
The group shared a minute of silence in memory of the four ­people believed to have taken their own lives during the crisis.
When Ip failed to appear at the public entrance, protesters intercepted Yau Tsim Mong district ­officer Laura Liang Aron but she refused to give her views on the ­extradition bill.
""The government's stance is very clear,"" Aron said. ""I have nothing to add.""
Ip reached the meeting room via a staff entrance. He called for a minute's silence, but was immediately confronted by protesters.
""Who are you taking a minute of silence for? What are their names?"" one shouted.
Failing to calm protesters, Ip paused the meeting for three ­minutes. Chaos returned after Ip again refused to allow Yu to table the motion.
Ip then adjourned the meeting and left the room. He was escorted by police to Mong Kok East station with protesters close behind."
South China Morning Post,2019-07-03,Tactics create divisions Police strategy during assault on Legco said to have avoided bloody clashes,932 ,"
Police restraint as protesters ­rampaged through Hong Kong's legislature earned praise for avoiding bloody clashes but ­others, including frontline ­officers, called it ""negligence"" that sacrificed force morale and the rule of law the city takes pride in.
""If someone breaks the law, we, as police officers, must deal with it as fast as possible. It is a simple logic,"" a senior officer said, on condition of anonymity.
Protesters against a contentious extradition bill assaulted the Legislative Council in Admiralty for more than 11 hours, including a three-hour rampage inside the building that left a trail of damage.
A clearance operation began at midnight, during which 3,000 officers dispersed thousands of protesters inside and outside ­Legco within an hour.
The officer said the inaction was ""negligence"".
""Protesters were deliberately allowed to ram the glass doors and windows of Legco in front of cameras and television crews for hours because no action was taken to stop them,"" he said.
He called the tolerant approach a ""PR show"" after police were accused of using excessive force against protesters in June.
Police have adopted a controlled approach and kept a minimal presence since June 12, when officers fired tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds to disperse protesters, some of whom used sharpened metal poles, bricks and barriers to storm officers' defence lines outside the legislature and government headquarters in Admiralty.
From 1pm on Monday, protesters used a metal cart to pound the legislature's glass door and struck the building's windows and doors with metal bars for about eight hours while around 1,000 officers in riot gear stood guard inside.
When protesters broke in at about 9pm, police retreated, ­allowing the invaders to tear down political leaders' portraits, spray slogans on the walls and smash furniture.
""It appears police had no ­intention to make any arrests during the clearance operation in a move to avoid bloody clashes,"" another officer said.
""High-ranking commanders feel it is a good tactic and successful because no casualties were reported. But a lot of our colleagues feel disappointed and dissatisfied with the strategy as it hit our morale and image,"" he said.
""Reports over the continuous attacks at the legislature could lead the public locally and globally to think law and order does not exist in Hong Kong.""
He said the force's management had won public support this time, but ""sacrificed us"". It was not their task to do a PR job and ""our duty is to enforce the law and maintain order"", he said.
A spokesman for the 25,000-member Junior Police Officers' Association said the overall ­morale among his colleagues ­remained high, but some might find the enforcement had not been strong enough. ""Our determination to defend law and order in Hong Kong is still strong and this does not change,"" he said.
The association yesterday jointly condemned the protesters' violence, along with three other groups representing officers of various ranks.
The police chief, Stephen Lo Wai-chung, at a 4am press conference yesterday, rejected that officers retreated in an attempt to win public support and to set a trap for protesters.
He said police had ""no choice"" but to retreat temporarily and rethink their strategy.
Lo cited several incidents that prompted police to retreat, including protesters' throwing an unknown substance giving off white smoke into the building, and the fear of a blackout and stampede after demonstrators tampered with an electrical box, causing some lights to go out.
Lo added there were 30,000 protesters outside Legco and the surrounding area at 9pm, including some who had smashed an ­inner door at the main entrance.
The restrictive indoor setting would also have created difficulties for police, he added.
Police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Council said yesterday it would launch a study into officers' actions during the protests of June 9, 12 and Monday.
IPCC chairman Dr Anthony Neoh said a report would be ready in six months for submission to Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor. It would not seek to find who should be held responsible for any possible deficiency in the operations.
He conceded the council had no investigative power, nor the ability to summon witnesses, but said it had the ""full support"" and ""full cooperation"" of Lam and Lo.
But he said the original idea to appoint a judge to help the review was dropped as the job could clash with an appointee's judicial ­duties.
Former IPCC member and lawmaker Kenneth Leung ­Kai-cheong questioned the police retreat at 9pm. ""I can't understand Stephen Lo's explanation that officers couldn't work when there was lots of smoke,"" Leung said. ""Even in that case, they could stay in the building and guard it.""
While the third law enforcement source said the illegal acts would be followed up, a veteran detective said the investigation would be difficult, as protesters were wearing masks and gloves at the time of the siege.
Nelson Lee Ka-kiu, a political scientist at Chinese University, said the unexpected retreat ­reflected how the government was trying to divide its opponents, a tactic it had successfully used during the Occupy movement in 2014. ""The government hoped to move more moderate members of society to stand against the violent acts and therefore weaken the opposition,"" he said.
But pro-establishment lawmaker Michael Tien Puk-sun said the force deserved ""high praise"" for its restraint. ""I can't imagine the consequences had police ramped up efforts to clear them out,"" he said.

South China Morning Post,2019-10-13,Trump says pact 'very positive' for city but protesters disappointed,586 ,"
United States President Donald Trump said the trade deal he struck with China was ""very positive"" for Hong Kong and claimed the city's anti-government protests had de-escalated significantly, leaving some demonstrators disappointed he did not push for their cause.
Speaking at the Oval Office after a meeting with Vice-Premier Liu He, Trump was asked if Hong Kong featured in their talks. ""We discussed Hong Kong, and I think great progress has been made by China in Hong Kong,"" Trump said. ""I've been watching, and I actually told the vice-premier it really has toned down a lot from the initial days of a number of months ago when I saw a lot of people, and I see far fewer now,"" he said, adding that the situation was ""going to take care of itself"".
""I actually think this deal is a great deal for the people of Hong Kong to see what happened. I think this is a very positive thing for Hong Kong. But ... it really has de-escalated a lot from the beginning, and we were discussing that.""
Trump's comments sparked a spirited debate on the protesters' social media platform, LIHKG. ""Trump thinks we should pack it in. We still want to count on the Americans?"" a user wrote. Another said: ""I have said Western countries would only view Hong Kong as their pawn. Don't be so naive that they value the so-called 'values of democracy and freedoms'.""
While some urged others to be ""awake"" and just count on themselves and Hongkongers, several others suggested the ""escalation of force"". Another group believed they should work harder to explain to the world the reasons behind the drop in participants, while Trump's comment that the protests had ""de-escalated"" touched a raw nerve. ""We need a massive march. Peaceful protesters have to come out even under legal risks!"" a user wrote.
In his remarks, Trump did not mention a bill now in the US Congress that would subject Hong Kong to an annual review of its democratic freedoms and could strip the city of its special trading status. Protesters have been lobbying Congress to pass the bipartisan Human Rights and Democracy Act, arguing this would hold China to its promises to ensure Hong Kong's freedoms on its return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
On Trump's remarks that the deal was ""very positive"" for Hong Kong, Lau Siu-kai, vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau studies, said he believed the US president was referring to the economy. ""As there will be no further sanction on China following a deal, Hong Kong's economy will benefit,"" Lau said.
Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University, said Hong Kong was a trivial issue in the US-China trade talks. ""Even if the Hong Kong issue was mentioned, there won't be any outcome.""
Pan-democratic lawmaker Claudia Mo Man-ching said it was all diplomatic talk from the US leader. ""Trump played it safe. For sure he will not openly criticise Beijing on this matter,"" she said, adding that the pro-democracy camp was focused on the Human Rights and Democracy Act and not the trade deal.
Civic Party leader Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu said: ""It is a fact Hong Kong has gained wide attention in the international community. I believe Hongkongers will continue to work hard and tell the world what's going on here.""
Felix Chung Kwok-pan, legislator for the textiles and garment constituency, said he believed the positive deal would mean no more additional tariffs, which would benefit businesses that export to the US.

South China Morning Post,2019-08-16,organiser of major rallies barred from holding march Police say Civil Human Rights Front cannot ensu,662 ,"
Police have barred a prominent rally organiser from holding a march on Sunday, saying the group could not ensure public safety given the escalating ­violence at recent protests.
This is the first time the Civil Human Rights Front, which leads the annual pro-democracy march on July 1 and drew a turnout of 2 million for a demonstration in June, has had its protest plans banned, according to former leader Jackie Hung Ling-yu.
In a letter to the group, police cited 18 anti-government demonstrations held since June that ended in violence and injuries. Five were held by the front.
""Protesters not only got violent, engaged in arson and large-scale road blockage, but also used petrol bombs, steel balls, bricks, iron bars and other self-made weapons to destroy public ­property, disturb social peace and cause injuries,"" it said.
The group, however, can go ahead with a rally at Victoria Park in Causeway Bay from 10am to 11pm on Sunday. A turnout of 300,000 is expected.
But permission for a march from the park to Chater Road in Central has been denied. Police said there was reason to believe some participants would deviate from the proposed route and ""get out of control"".
Front convenor Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit said the group was ""extremely discontented"" with the police decision and intended to appeal against the ban. ""In objecting to the front's [plan] for a safe, lawful, peaceful march, the police are disregarding public safety,"" he added, suggesting things could end up being more chaotic if ­people marched on their own without marshals or a fixed route.
The front has up till now satisfied police with its deployment of marshals at marches.
This will be the 11th straight weekend of protests triggeredby the government's now-suspended extradition bill.
With police and protesters embroiled in escalating violence in recent weeks, the force has banned protests for the fourth consecutive weekend citing ­public safety reasons.
A police spokesman yesterday said telecoms firms had agreed to send text messages to notify phone users of any disruptions to public order at future events.
Apart from the front's event, police have also banned a proposed march in Hung Hom in Kowloon planned for tomorrow.
Ahead of news of the ban on Sunday's march, a group of masked protesters came forward to say they had ""learned the ­lessons"" and would avoid chaos at the rally that day. Referring to attacks on two mainlanders by protesters at the airport on Tuesday night, they promised not to act against their fundamental ­beliefs in human rights and ­liberty.
In Macau, police have banned a silent protest planned at Senado Square for Monday to support the Hong Kong protesters' cause.
Meanwhile, a rally at Chater Garden in Central tonight, jointly organised by the Hong Kong Federation of Students and a group called ""Stand With Hong Kong"", has been given the green light.
Brian Leung, the protester who unmasked himself and appealed to others to stay and occupy the Legislative Council on July 1 after hundreds broke into the building, is expected to deliver a pre-recorded speech at the rally in Central. Leung has left the city.
There will also be a video speech by Ray Wong Toi-yeung, a localist who obtained refuge in Germany after being charged with rioting in Mong Kok in 2016.
Rally organisers said their two main aims were to appeal to Britain to declare Beijing had violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration signed ahead of the city's handover to China in 1997, and to ask the United States Congress to fast-track the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.
Ahead of the weekend's protests, internet users have renewed calls for people to withdraw their money from banks today in an attempt to crash the financial system. Major banks including HSBC, Hang Seng, Citi and Standard Chartered yesterday said there had been no unusual activity at their ATMs or banks so far.
The Hong Kong Monetary ­Authority said nothing unusual had been reported.

South China Morning Post,2019-07-05,Radical core of protesters who trashed Legco 'willing to die for their cause',597 ,"
A squad of radical protesters ­fancying themselves as martyrs, willing to die to draw global attention to their cause, led the violent siege of Hong Kong's legislature on Monday, according to sources.
A government source said the group of about 10 diehards with a ""bring it on"" mentality were prepared to face batons and rubber bullets during clashes with police that day, and they were in the cross hairs of police going after those who perpetrated the unprecedented invasion and trashing of the Legislative Council building.
""The protesters at the front were willing to sacrifice themselves. They turned so violent, hoping police would use aggressive force against them or shoot them with rubber bullets or beanbag rounds,"" the source said.
""If the individuals were badly injured or even killed, all the blame would have been placed on police so as to spark global condemnation, and eventually bring the whole administration down.""
The source said the administration expected this radical group to organise more protests and provoke further clashes in the future to achieve its aims.
They were among the dozens of protesters against the government's now-suspended extradition bill who had already been identified and would be the target of a police operation to arrest those responsible.
The Post was told that officers from the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau were also trying to identify those behind this group.
Police made the first arrest on Wednesday in their hunt for protesters who spent hours smashing the glass front of the legislature with makeshift battering rams before rushing in to vandalise the premises.
The suspect, a 31-year-old man, faced charges including forcible entry and criminal damage.
Another source said police were trying to identify hundreds of protesters both inside and outside the Legco building during the 11-hour siege who dispersed when officers in riot gear moved in using tear gas.
No one was arrested during the one-hour clearance operation, and those occupying the Legco chamber had already fled.
The source said protesters considered less violent would be the next target for police, even though they might not have been directly involved in smashing their way into the building.
""They broke the law as they attended an unlawful assembly. If it is classified as a riot in future, they may also face the charge of taking part in a riot,"" he said.
The Legco siege made headlines around the world, as mostly young protesters vented their rage against the government and demanded the complete withdrawal of the bill, which would have ­allowed the transfer of fugitives to the mainland and other jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has no extradition deal.
They had fled by the time ­police took action at midnight to take the legislature back.
During two days of on-site investigations that followed, police worked with government forensic experts to collect thousands of pieces of evidence, including face masks, goggles, helmets, bricks, stickers and fliers that the protesters had left behind.
Forensic experts were also collecting fingerprints and testing DNA evidence stored in a locked compound at their headquarters in Wan Chai.
""Officers have also started the painstaking task of viewing video footage from surveillance cameras to identify the suspects,"" a law enforcement source said, adding that CCTV footage from the centre of the protests in Admiralty and along routes taken by the demonstrators would also be studied.
He admitted it was a ""very difficult task"" as most of the protesters had helmets, face masks and goggles on to hide their identities."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-06,Lam's comments 'are only addingfuel to the fire' Political observers warn that chief executive defin,720 ,"
The move by Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to define the recent unrest in the city as an attack on Beijing's sovereignty could escalate already heightened tensions between the government and its opponents, political observers have warned.
One analyst said Lam's comments - her first in public in two weeks - would only fan the flames of discontent, and would do little to end the weeks of protests, most of which are increasingly violent.
Hong Kong was brought to a standstill yesterday morning as protesters paralysed the city's MTR railway system by blocking train doors, in response to calls for a citywide strike.
Lam said she would not accept any of the protesters' demands, such as for her to resign and for a commission of inquiry into the clashes between demonstrators and police that have roiled the city since early June.
She insisted the protests were no longer about her governance or the now-shelved extradition bill.
Professor Joseph Chan Cho-wai, a political scientist at the University of Hong Kong, said the chief executive's remarks at her press conference yesterday only ""added fuel to the fire"".
He and Andrew Fung Ho-keung, chief executive of the Hong Kong Policy Research Institute, expected the police to take tougher action against protesters after Lam's new characterisation of the clashes.
""The confrontation between protesters and police is set to escalate as Lam failed to respond to protesters' demands,"" Chan said. ""I'm worried that deaths and serious injuries will happen, as the clashes between two sides are turning more violent.""
In her address, Lam condemned protesters who chanted ""Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times"" and threw a Chinese flag into the harbour, after tens of thousands defied a police ban and joined an unlawful march from Tai Kok Tsui to Tsim Sha Tsui on Saturday.
Fung said he was worried the government would take a tougher stance after Lam claimed the protests had transformed into an attack on Beijing's sovereignty and the ""one country, two systems"" framework, under which the city is promised freedoms not allowed in the rest of China.
""By labelling the protests [as] attacks on the national sovereignty, the government will have strong grounds not to respond to demands of members of the public, but resort to tougher actions against protesters,"" he said.
He said Lam's repeated condemnation of protesters' actions would not cool tensions. ""She needs to come up with feasible ways to defuse the crisis,"" he said.
Chan said he believed Lam wanted to tell the public it was no longer a problem with her governance as the nature of the protests had changed.
""I expect the government to engage in a battle of public opinion with protesters,"" he said. ""The government will strive to win over members of the public who want stability.""
But Chan said the government would struggle to win over moderate residents unless it responded to some of the protesters' demands.
""The police are fighting a losing battle unless the government takes bold steps to curb civil liberties in Hong Kong,"" he said.
Some Beijing loyalists were also unimpressed by Lam's press conference, which did not offer a way out of the crisis.
Ann Chiang Lai-wan, a lawmaker from the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB), wrote on her Facebook page that Lam had raised a lot of issues but did not come up with any solutions. ""Disappointed!"" she wrote.
Gary Chan Hak-kan, a lawmaker and DAB vice-chairman, said the protests were hitting the local economy, and called for society to take a break from protests and return to normal.
Claudia Mo Man-ching, convenor of the pan-democratic camp in the Legislative Council, said Lam had to be held accountable if Hong Kong became dragged down a ""path of no return"", a phrase used by the chief executive yesterday.
Mo said Lam was responsible for the damage to society, which the city leader had instead pinned on protesters.
A 20-year-old university student, who sat on a Fortress Hill MTR platform yesterday morning listening to a live stream of Lam's press conference, said her remarks would only make him and other young people angrier.
""She is like a recording machine repeating condemnations. She condemns the damage of inanimate things and doesn't care about the use of excessive force on people,"" he said."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-13,Protesters who use violence engaging in 'terrorist activity' Beijing's liaison office also says city,593 ,"
Beijing yesterday called the ­escalating violence by anti-government protesters in Hong Kong ""terrorist activity"" as it urged city police to crack down.
Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), read out a stern statement to Hong Kong media saying the city was at a ""critical moment"".
In particular, the spokesman condemned as reckless petrol bomb attacks on police stations by protesters that left an officer ­injured on Sunday.
""In recent days, Hong Kong's radical protesters have repeatedly attacked police with highly dangerous tools, which constitute serious violent crimes and have started to show signs of terrorism,"" Yang said.
""This type of violent criminal activity must be resolutely combated according to the law, with no hesitation or mercy.""
The central government's representative office in Hong Kong also described the escalating violence as terrorism in a separate statement.
""Nowhere in the world would tolerate these heinous and extreme atrocities,"" the liaison office said. ""If we allow these types of terrorist activities to continue, then Hong Kong will slide into a bottomless abyss.""
But soon after the HKMAO spokesman's warning, Hong Kong police gave a separate briefing, playing down the threat level and saying violence seen in the city in recent days should not be described as terrorism.
Chris Tang Ping-keung, a deputy police commissioner, said mass protests and terrorism were different and the United Nations description should be followed in determining what was terrorism.
""There were protesters who used lethal weapons to attack ­police officers,"" Tang said.
""[We will] continue to monitor the situation.""
In its statement, the liaison ­office also called on the public to support the city's government and police to end the unrest, and to safeguard the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement.
""The most pressing desire for most Hong Kong residents now is an end to the violence and a return to stability and order in Hong Kong as soon as possible,"" the ­office said.
The remarks yesterday came after heightened violence on ­Sunday, with tense clashes ­between protesters and police in Tsim Sha Tsui, Sham Shui Po, Wan Chai and Kwai Chung, ­including the first instance of police firing tear gas in an enclosed MTR station, in Kwai Fong.
Protesters fought back with bricks and petrol bombs, in a continuation of their hit-and-run strategy.
Shocking scenes of police violence on Sunday marked the 10th week of anti-government protests in the city that were initially sparked by a now-shelved extradition bill.
Yang also said that Hong Kong had reached a ""critical moment"", urging people to stand up and ­reject illegal behaviour and the ­actions of ""violent radicals"", which he described as the city's most pressing goal.
The short HKMAO press conference was its third such briefing on the protests - and also the third since Hong Kong's sovereignty was transferred from Britain to China in 1997.
Last week, Zhang Xiaoming, director of the office, warned at a Shenzhen seminar that the city had reached its ""most serious ­situation"" since its handover to Beijing.
Protesters also held a press briefing yesterday, with masked representatives criticising police handling of the protests on ­Sunday and reiterating their five key demands - including officially withdrawing the extradition bill, an independent investigation of police use of force, and universal suffrage.
""Hong Kong has just seen its darkest weekend in its contemporary history,"" one activist said. ""Hong Kong turned into a torture field overnight."""
South China Morning Post,2019-10-13,Mask ban again has demonstrators take to the streets,767 ,"
Hundreds of black-clad ­demonstrators took to the streets of Hong Kong again yesterday to protest against the government's anti-mask law, and even as the rallies remained largely peaceful, petrol bombs were thrown at metro stations, while some shops were trashed.
Protesters also gathered in Prince Edward and Wan Chai to call for an end to alleged police brutality, hours after Cardinal John Tong Hon, the head of the city's Catholic community, made an appeal for peace on a radio programme and said law enforcement officers needed to perform their duties with their conscience.
""They also need to abide by the law, so that the people's trust and respect in them can be rebuilt,"" he said. Tong added that while it was natural for people to be disappointed when their demands were not met, hatred would only give rise to violence, turning problems into more hurt.
The protest came as United States President Donald Trump said the trade deal he struck with China on Friday was ""very positive"" for the city and claimed its anti-government protests had de-escalated significantly, leaving some demonstrators disappointed he did not push for their cause.
Shortly before Friday midnight, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor wrote on her Facebook page that she hoped she could enter the Legislative Council building on Wednesday to deliver her policy address.
Hong Kong has been roiled by more than four months of anti-government protests sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill.
Messages were previously circulated online, calling for people to march from Tsim Sha Tsui to Sham Shui Po or the West Kowloon high-speed railway terminus yesterday. But only the march to Sham Shui Po went ahead.
Marchers gathered at the Clock Tower in Tsim Sha Tsui at 3pm for the unauthorised demonstration. Some of them carried American and British flags to urge the countries to stand with Hong Kong.
Minutes after the march began, protesters left the pavement and walked on Salisbury Road and Nathan Road, forcing vehicles to stop on the busy carriageways. They also set up roadblocks at the junction of Haiphong Road and Nathan Road, disrupting traffic and causing confusion for passengers waiting at bus stops.
A 12-year-old girl, her face covered by a mask from the movie V for Vendetta, said fewer people joined the protests yesterday as police had stepped up their efforts. ""I want to tell the government that even though they have the anti-mask law, we still have the right to wear a mask,"" she said.
Protesters said apart from the ban on masks, they were also concerned about a Chinese University student's recent claim she was sexually assaulted by a policeman after being arrested on August 31, as well as what they described as the ""mysterious"" death of a 15-year-old girl who had been reported missing but whose body was revealed on Friday to have been found in the sea in September.
Addressing online rumours the teenager and others could have been killed by police, acting chief superintendent Kelvin Kong Wing-cheung said on Friday that an investigation, including an autopsy, found nothing suspicious about her death.
There was no protest in Kowloon Tong but at about 3pm, two petrol bombs appeared to have been thrown at the MTR station, seriously damaging facilities. No one was injured in the incident. Lai Chi Kok station was also closed after a fire at one of its entrances.
In a statement, police warned ""rioters"" to stop all illegal ­activities.
As the marching protesters reached Yau Ma Tei, some trashed a branch of Best Mart 360 and facilities at Kowloon Government Offices. While most dispersed after the march ended in Sham Shui Po at about 5pm, some vandalised a Starbucks outlet in Lai Chi Kok while others lit a fire at the entrance of the Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices. Both premises were closed at the time.
Outside the Wan Chai police headquarters, about 40 middle-aged and elderly people kicked off a two-day sit-in to protest against alleged police brutality.
Meanwhile, more than 300 people gathered in Sha Tin's New Town Plaza mall to chant slogans.
At 9.30pm, a dozen black-clad men in masks went to the nearby MTR station and started to smash turnstiles, a monitor and the glass screen of the customer service centre, and fled in two minutes.
Victoria Li, a young mother, joined the protests with her five-year-old son, who wore an Ant Man mask. ""It's very dangerous for Lam to invoke the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, and bypass the entire legislature. Hong Kong will become no different from other mainland Chinese cities,"" she said.

South China Morning Post,2019-10-30,Top blogger calls for Beijing to lead probe into police Weibo star warns of 'moral betrayal' if viol,510 ,"
An inquiry that focused on claims police have used excessive force during the 21 weeks of street protests in Hong Kong and ignored violence by demonstrators would amount to a ""moral betrayal"", mainland commentator Ren Yi told his million-plus Weibo followers.
If such a commission were set up, it should be led by Beijing and must also look at the possibility of foreign interference in the protest movement, said Ren, who writes under the pseudonym of ­Chairman Rabbit.
""From the perspective of the police force, it's the Hong Kong government's inability to resolve a political crisis that has pushed them to the front line and forced them to clash with the protesters,"" said Ren, a graduate of Harvard University's John F Kennedy School of Government.
A commission that only looked at police conduct would be insufficient and inherently biased, he said. Such a body should only be set up if protesters gave up violence. Otherwise, the movement's radicals would be encouraged to try to undermine the government further.
Ren's article - in response to a Post report that the government may set up a commission of ­inquiry (COI) if the public was unhappy with the findings of a police watchdog - went viral on the mainland and was shared by many members of the elite. It also reappeared on Ren's WeChat ­account and had been read more than 620,000 times by yesterday.
Ren said an inquiry in the present circumstances would be counterproductive.
""Judging from Chief Executive Carrie Lam [Cheng Yuet-ngor]'s latest remarks, she was inclined to compromise on the COI. But given the tense situation in Hong Kong, the COI would be the most severe blow to police officers after they have done months of hard work,"" Ren said. ""The COI, should it be set up according to the ­protesters' ­wishes, could only condemn the police force to ­satisfy the radicals, a move that would only drag down the police force's morale, make the unrest last even longer and damage the 'one country, two systems' ­framework.""
Ren suggested Beijing should play a role in any commission, perhaps designating a member or setting its agenda.
""Beijing, instead of the Carrie Lam-led Hong Kong government, can initiate such a COI and ask it to do a comprehensive report with topics including why the extradition bill was proposed by the government; Hong Kong's deep-rooted welfare and economic woes; how protesters were ­organised; and what factors were ­hindering police officers' law ­enforcement actions,"" Ren said.
The establishment of a commission was the second of five ­demands made by ­protesters. The first, the formal withdrawal of the extradition bill, was met in September. A source close to the city government said a commission could be considered as a response to the demands.
While Ren proposed a Beijing-initiated inquiry, observers from both the mainland and Hong Kong doubted that such a move would help defuse tensions.
Lau Siu-kai, vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said such an inquiry would only start another round of political unrest in the city."
South China Morning Post,2019-09-28,Why police stopped using remote centre to hold protesters,732 ,"
Where is San Uk Ling Holding Centre and why it was built?
The detention centre was set up in 1979, roughly 1.5km from the Shenzhen-Hong Kong border. Back then it was intended to hold stowaways from the mainland, before they were sent back.
After the Tiananmen Square crackdown on June 4, 1989, it became a temporary shelter for protesters saved by Operation Yellow Bird - an eight-year scheme that helped Chinese dissidents escape overseas via Hong Kong.
The centre has since become desolate and mainly houses illegal immigrants. In 2005, it held a number of militant South Korean farmers arrested during clashes with police during a World Trade Organisation conference.
When and why did police detain arrested protesters at San Uk Ling?
A police insider said arrested protesters were generally held at police stations when the unrest began in early June. But as the number of arrests grew and protesters constantly besieged police stations to support detainees, the force turned to San Uk Ling as a temporary alternative.
The first group of protesters sent there were among 148 arrested on August 5, when a citywide strike turned violent and crippled Hong Kong. Protesters arrested in three other operations, including in Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui on August 11 and Prince Edward on August 31, were also sent there.
""We want to centralise the arrestees for easy management after making a mass arrest. Also, we have to take them away from the heat of war zones. This is to protect our police stations and the safety of suspects,"" the source said, adding that at peak times the force had as many as 75 detainees in the centre.
What did the detainees say?
A report released by NGO Amnesty International on September 20 accused police of resorting to ""retaliatory violence"" at San Uk Ling by torturing or mistreating suspects.
That was based on interviews with 21 people arrested but later released, who said officers punched or severely beat them, while they put up no resistance. Detainees also accused police of preventing them from calling a lawyer, for lack of a phone. Others said they had to wait 12 hours before seeing a legal representative. There were also rumours that detainees were raped and sexually assaulted by officers.
How did the authorities and police rebut the accusations?
Chief Superintendent John Tse Chun-chung from the Police Public Relations Branch said yesterday the centre was a standard detention facility, used in line with police regulations.
He said all the allegations were ""unnamed"", ""unverified"" and ""untrue"". He said the force had only received two complaints related to San Uk Ling, neither of them related to sexual violence.
""We do not accept such anonymous accusations. It's very unfair for anyone to make an accusation without coming forward,"" Tse said. ""We appeal to anyone who feels aggrieved by police to make a report to us in person.""
He said the centre's remoteness meant it took a while to arrange medical or legal help.
Kong Wing-cheung, a senior superintendent from the same branch, said earlier that he believed some of the detainees' injuries were caused while they were being arrested.
Lo Su-vui, a Hospital Authority executive, said on August 28 that North District Hospital received 30 patients from the centre between August 12 and 13 but none said they had been raped or sexually assaulted.
Where will the arrested protesters be held in future?
According to Tse, the force had not used the centre to hold arrested protesters since September 2, and would in future use detention centres in police stations across the city in case of mass arrests. But he stressed that did not mean the force had erred in using San Uk Ling. ""The decision [to stop using the centre] has nothing to do with the groundless claims accusing the police of misconduct like excessive use of force and sexual harassment,"" Tse said. ""The reason is to avoid any further public speculation. and unnecessary remarks accusing the police.""
Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor announced on Thursday that police would stop holding anti-government protesters at a controversial facility where detainees have alleged abuse in custody. Police have denied the accusations, but the treatment of protesters at the San Uk Ling Holding Centre, in Sheung Shui, has sparked widespread concern. Activists gathered at Edinburgh Place yesterday to express their support for people who were held there"
South China Morning Post,2019-07-20,HKU chief shows way to go in crisis,383 ,"
If Hong Kong is to find a way out of its problems, amid regular protests and clashes with police, honest and open dialogue will be needed. There has not been enough rational debate in recent weeks, with sharp divisions between the government and protesters. A forum at which University of Hong Kong president Zhang Xiang talked with students and alumni was, therefore, welcome. It sets a good example for others to follow.
Zhang, a mainland-born US citizen who took up the position a year ago, faced strong criticism from students over comments he made following the storming of the Legislative Council by demonstrators on July 1. He condemned the violence, which he described as destructive. Students felt he had failed to empathise with them and ignored violence by police during the protests.
A petition calling on Zhang to retract the statement was signed by more than 2,100. There was also a protest march on the university's campus. He demonstrated a willingness not only to talk, but to listen. When around 100 students gathered at his residence late at night, he met them and, using a megaphone, said he appreciated their concerns for society. Zhang drew applause when he pledged not to allow police to enter the campus to arrest students without a warrant and promised support for those affected by the protests. His willingness to engage them helped defuse the situation.
Zhang also promised to take part in an open forum with students. At that event on Thursday he stood by his condemnation of violence, but he also showed humility, saying criticism of his comments on the protests had been fair. He admitted he had failed to address the frustrations of young protesters and promised to listen more carefully in the future. His comments at the forum did not satisfy everyone. But it was a good start. Zhang treated the students as equals and with respect. He spoke of the importance of dialogue and of sometimes ""agreeing to disagree"". This is what the city needs.
The government has tried to set up meetings with students, but its approaches have been rejected unless certain preconditions are met. It must try harder to facilitate such discussions. If they do take place, the open, respectful and engaging approach adopted by Zhang should be adopted. It is to be hoped more debates will follow."
South China Morning Post,2019-09-01,The night the city was set ablaze The night that Hong Kong was set ablaze Police fire live rounds to,1157 ,"
Rampaging protesters reduced Hong Kong's streets to charred battlefields yesterday, setting off multiple fires and hurling petrol bombs at riot police who fought back by firing blue dye from water cannons and tear gas, as the city marked yet another weekend of heightened violence.
For the second time in a week, police fired two live rounds into the air to fight off a violent mob near Victoria Park, sources told the Post, as word spread of undercover officers mingling with the demonstrators.
The incident was just one of many shocking turns of the day on the 13th straight weekend of ­protests in the city.
Hardcore elements took their criminal acts to new extremes by lighting bonfires of cardboard and other flammable material, rubbish bins and any junk they could lay their hands on as they moved from one district to another leaving a trail of destruction in their wake, and a step ahead of police.
Defying a ban on demonstrations, they took over roads and mounted makeshift barricades, from behind which they hurled bricks and petrol bombs at police lines.
They first began by besieging police headquarters in Wan Chai, throwing petrol bombs at the heavily barricaded building.
At one point, they surrounded the equally barricaded government headquarters and the Legislative Council compound, hacking down a fence with metal poles and throwing bricks at riot police standing watch inside, as others flashed laser pointers ­repeatedly at officers.
By night time, demonstrators fanned out across the harbour to ­Kowloon, staging a flash mob protest in the tourist hub of Tsim Sha Tsui, setting off more fires along the main shopping artery of ­Nathan Road and its side streets.
Riot police again charged at them and fired rounds of tear gas. The protesters dispersed and an hour later, reappeared further north in Mong Kok, in even larger ­numbers.
Across many parts of the city throughout the day, the shrill ­sirens of fire engines pierced the air. Overhead, Super Puma helicopters dispatched by the Government Flying Service zigzagged across Admiralty, Wan Chai and Central, the roar of their rotor blades mixing with the battle cries of protesters in a soundscape of a city at war.
""This is an example of the Hong Kong government and ­police suppressing us,"" retiree and protester Michael Chu, in his 60s said at Chater Garden as the helicopters, which a government website said were used for ""internal security and control of terrorist activities"", hovered above.
The MTR also suspended services at several stations throughout the day as the train operator had an injunction to shut down operations to prevent protesters from taking cover or using the transport to move from place to place. Still, that did not stop the mobs from vandalising several stations, including breaking a glass platform screen door at Wan Chai MTR station, jamming turnstiles at Admiralty and defacing walls at several stops, including there and at Causeway Bay, Tin Hau and Fortress Hill. At midnight five MTR lines were suspended.
The nearly 10 hours of ­mayhem kept the city on edge as Hong Kong marked the fifth anniversary of the announcement from Beijing of a restrictive electoral reform package on universal suffrage setting out how the city could elect its chief executive from a list of pre-vetted candidates. The announcement sparked the 79-day Occupy protests of 2014.
Police had banned the demonstrations citing security concerns and organisers said they cancelled the event but called on people to flash their cellphones at precisely 8.31pm to mark the fifth anniversary. But the moment came and went unnoticed as ­protesters and police faced off in a by-now regular routine of cat-and-mouse at ­multiple locations.
The day of defiance came in the wake of a police crackdown as prominent activists and three lawmakers were arrested on the eve of the banned march, all for their alleged involvement in previous protests during the nearly three months of unrest that have rocked the city.
Earlier in the day, defying the police ban, large crowds - many donning black T-shirts and armed with umbrellas - made their way at first peacefully through the streets of Hong Kong Island, taking over roads and chanting slogans such as ""Save our freedom"" and ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times"".
Spotted in the crowds were protesters who did not put on masks, openly daring the police to arrest them for marching. But soon, chaos reigned as radicals swarmed around the seat of government and finance in Admiralty and Central. The mob began throwing rocks, starting fires and shining laser pointers at police behind a barricade at the Legislative Council.
By 5.30pm, police's patience ran thin and out came the water cannons and they fired a mild spray and rounds of tear gas to disperse the crowds, who fought back by lobbing yet more Molotov cocktails, sparking fires.
Barely an hour later, protesters armed with metal poles had found a weak link in the blue-and-white water barricades around Legco - a stretch of metal fencing - and began hacking at it. The water cannons made another appearance and from a distance across the road sprayed jets of blue-coloured liquid mixed with pepper spray as riot police fired more tear gas at the protesters.
The protesters quickly dispersed in different directions and within minutes were all but gone.
Protesters had stormed Legco on July 1, on the 22nd anniversary of the return of Hong Kong from British to Chinese rule.
In a scene reminiscent of the storming of the building then, when protesters had used a metal cart as their battering ram to break the Legco's glass exteriors, this time a group suddenly appeared with a makeshift barricade made of a section of stadium seats they had ripped off from elsewhere. They used this fortification to start a fire and within minutes, a large blaze was lit. Three explosions were heard as they then threw petrol bombs into the flames.
Earlier, protesters tried to go to the official residence of Chief Executive leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor but were turned away by a phalanx of riot police.
John Cheung Kwok-keung, 30-year-old import-export businessman, was among protesters out and about, distributing supplies, including meal coupons, masks and T-shirts. He was not the least bit deterred by police warnings about the marches being illegal.
""I still have faith in Hong Kong's courts and judges that I would be vindicated even if police moved to arrest me,"" he said.
Earlier in the day, protesters gathered at Southorn Playground in Wan Chai for a religious rally to ""pray for sinners"" where they sang hymns, before marching towards Lam's residence at Government House. The group insisted that as they were part of a religious event, they did not need police approval.
The ""sinners"" rally was organised after the Civil Human Rights Front cancelled a march from Central to Beijing's liaison office in Western district after an appeals panel upheld a police ban on the event."
South China Morning Post,2019-07-25,Hong Kong and mainland students clash during rally at Australian university,492 ,"
Students from Hong Kong and the mainland clashed during a pro-democracy protest at a university in Australia yesterday.
Scuffles broke out between opposing groups at the University of Queensland in Brisbane after pro-democracy students staged a sit-in supporting the ongoing extradition bill protests in Hong Kong as well as condemning Beijing's treatment of Uygurs in Xinjiang.
Activist Tony Chang said mainland students singing the Chinese national anthem had attacked the pro-democracy protesters without provocation. ""They took our loudspeaker, and also some of our slogans, and even tore our slogans,"" he said, adding mainland students had punched a number of Hong Kong protesters in the face.
Richard Murray, a journalism lecturer at the university, said he saw punches thrown between several students before campus security intervened. Up to 40 police officers arrived on the scene to keep the groups apart but no arrests appeared to have been made, he said.
Murray said up to 1,000 students had gathered at the scene, most of them mainland Chinese. An internet petition condemning the pro-democracy protest had attracted more than 1,100 signatories by late afternoon.
""I came to this country for education, peace, and the careful community environment,"" said a student named as Keira Gao, who started the petition. ""However, today's protest unveiled the other facet of this school, which I felt strong discomfort about.""
""China has absolute respect for Xinjiang and Hong Kong in terms of politics and human rights,"" said a signatory named Flora Zhang.
""Hong Kong is a part of China,"" said another signatory calling himself Dawen Si.
Last month, the University of Queensland's student union voted to support pro-democracy protesters in the city and condemn the ""Hong Kong and Chinese governments for their subversion of democratic rights and freedoms in both Hong Kong and the People's Republicof China"".
Ian Hall, an international relations professor at the Griffith Asia Institute in Brisbane, said such clashes were likely to become more common, but Australian universities were ""woefully unprepared"" to deal with them.
""They are partly to blame too, because they have allowed Chinese student associations on campuses to be funded and controlled by the People's Republic of China embassy and consulates,"" Hall said. ""This has allowed PRC diplomats to monitor students, to intimidate them, if necessary, and to orchestrate shows of strength or support for the PRC.""
Fears of Chinese influence, including the monitoring and direction of international students by embassies and consulates, led Canberra to pass sweeping anti-foreign interference laws last year that strained relations with Beijing.
There were about 175,000 Chinese studying in Australia last year, according to the Department of Education. About 9,244 Hongkongers chose the country for study in 2013, according to the ICEF Monitor, which covers the international education industry. John Power"
South China Morning Post,2019-07-19,top brass gave order to enter shopping centre Riot police were sent into New Town Plaza to rescue co,660 ,"
Riot police were sent to a Hong Kong shopping centre to rescue some 20 detectives who were ­surrounded by extradition bill protesters, with the ensuing ­confrontation between the sides ending in bloody clashes, the Post has learned.
Sources yesterday said top brass ordered the ­deployment after officers from the elite Organised Crime and ­Triad ­Bureau were cornered near the entrance to Sha Tin MTR station in New Town ­Plaza on Sunday night.
The 100 officers and detectives, most in full riot gear, reportedly took about half an hour to reach their besieged colleagues, who were being targeted with ­verbal abuse and projectiles.
Among the police reinforcements was a sergeant who had part of his finger bitten off and a constable who was kicked down an escalator and assaulted.
A number of other officers sent on the rescue mission also ended up clashing with protesters, one law enforcement source added.
The violence began earlier that night when another squad of riot police was deployed to disperse hundreds of protesters who had barricaded the junction of Yuen Wo Road and Sha Tin Rural Committee Road.
Police originally wanted the protesters to leave peacefully, a source said, but when a barrage of bricks, helmets and umbrellas was hurled at officers on Wang Pok Street they were forced to react.
Police chased down protesters who had hurled items from the higher floors of the nearby Lucky Plaza and Sha Tin Centre ­shopping malls.
At the same time, more than 20 officers from the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau, led by Chief Superintendent Wong Wai, were deployed near the entrance of the MTR station after receiving an ­order from the command centre at Wan Chai police headquarters. The station entrance is a public access area.
The officers - who were on the lookout for rowdy protesters - wore helmets, and some were carrying shields. They had pepper spray and handguns.
""Dozens of violent protesters from the earlier confrontation [in Sha Tin] were the target of the ­arrests,"" another source said.
As a large crowd - mostly made up of protesters - walked towards the rail station, insults were ­shouted at the officers.
At the start of the crackdown, protesters hurled helmets and bottles of water at police. The crowd then grew rapidly and ­confrontations became more ­physical, with punches thrown and umbrellas used to jab officers, according to the source.
The chief superintendent was injured in the left forearm after being hit with an umbrella during the melee, a source said.
He added that it took the 100 riot police about half an hour to find and rescue their comrades and help them evacuate the mall.
""Soon after riot police entered the shopping centre, the officers were confronted by protesters who feared they would be chased down and arrested,"" he said.
The source said he believed more than half of the 13 injured officers were part of the group that had come to rescue the detectives.
The source also said on-site commanders did not know the exact location of the surrounded officers, and that the force would review its operations.
Earlier on Sunday, a peaceful march in Sha Tin had drawn an estimated 115,000 people before a confrontation started at about 5pm and then descended into ­violence that left 28 people injured, including 13 police officers.
Police arrested 47 people.
The now-suspended extradition bill would allow the transfer of fugitives from Hong Kong to jurisdictions with which it lacks a formal handover arrangement.
The proposal has sparked weeks of protests from critics who say it would leave city residents at risk of unfair trials north of the border.
The worsening violence and growing desperation among police prompted a meeting between the force's four associations and senior officers on Monday.
Commissioner of Police ­Stephen Lo Wai-chung pledged in the meeting to make officers' safety a priority when planning strategy and to improve protective gear for plain-clothes police on the front lines.

South China Morning Post,2019-07-29,Key figure behind march in Yuen Long arrested Town resident who was issued a police letter of object,618 ,"
Police have arrested a proponent of Saturday's march in Yuen Long for organising an unlawful ­assembly, which hundreds of thousands of protesters were ­estimated to have joined despite it being banned by the force.
Max Chung Kin-ping, 39, is among the 14 people police have so far arrested for the protest. The others were held for unauthorised assembly, possession of offensive weapons and common assault.
Chung was taken away by police after he attended an RTHK forum at Victoria Park yesterday, according to Michael Mo Kwan-tai, the march co-applicant.
After losing an appeal on Friday against the police objection to the march in Yuen Long, Chung said he would still go ahead alone and would not ask people to ­follow him.
But he added at the time: ""Of course, if some people want to buy sweetheart cakes or do something else such as taking a walk in Yuen Long, as a Yuen Long ­resident, I absolutely welcome [them].""
And at a press briefing on Saturday night, Chung denied the protest was a march.
""First, I want to clarify that ­today is not a march. We are all individuals, so I haven't told anyone to do anything,"" he said.
Chung proposed the march after more than 100 white-clad men attacked protesters in black T-shirts, other passengers and journalists at Yuen Long MTR ­station on July 21. At least 45 ­people were injured.
But Senior Superintendent Yolanda Yu Hoi-kwan of the ­Police Public Relations Bureau said yesterday afternoon: ""[Chung] insisted on going to Yuen Long ... ending in a series of violent acts. The police will never condone this behaviour.""
Yu said the force had confiscated weapons, including imitation firearms and metal rods, at the protest.
She confirmed at least 14 people had been arrested in connection with the protest, and that Chung was arrested yesterday for organising an unapproved march and assembly after receiving a letter of objection from police.
Chung estimated 288,000 people marched on the route he proposed. Police did not give a figure, saying it was an illegal assembly.
The march ended in clashes between the protesters and police when officers tried to disperse the crowds from occupied roads in Yuen Long with tear gas, rubber bullets and sponge grenades.
The last round of clashes broke out inside Yuen Long MTR station after 10pm, when officers hit ­protesters with batons and fired pepper spray, after demonstrators threw fire extinguishers from a bridge. At least 23 people were injured in the clashes throughout the day.
Chung had said earlier that he advocated a ""peaceful, rational and non-violent"" protest, but could not give a guarantee.
In Hong Kong, public assemblies are governed by the Public Order Ordinance.
An assembly can only be held if police do not prohibit or object to it - otherwise it will be considered an unauthorised assembly. Participants and organisers are liable to imprisonment for five years on conviction on indictment and a HK$5,000 fine and imprisonment for three years on summary ­conviction.
Barrister Albert Luk Wai-hung said there would be one key factor in determining if Chung had ­organised or taken part in an unlawful march and assembly.
""If he was only there shopping, it should be no problem,"" said Luk, ""If he had been there meeting other protesters or discussing with them what they should do, that is another story.""
Luk said police might have ­collected some evidence.
Lawmaker James To Kun-sun, of the opposition Democratic Party, who is also a lawyer, criticised the police for abusing their power, pointing out that Chung, who was walking alone in Yuen Long, could just have been shopping there.
""How could he have the power to stop others from going to Yuen Long?"" To said.
""Basically, there was no march in Yuen Long."""
South China Morning Post,2019-08-27,top talent scared off asprotests escalate Candidates becoming more reluctant to accept roles in Hong,726 ,"
Protests are weighing on Hong Kong's job market, making it harder for recruiters to lure top talent to the city and prompting other workers already here to ask about opportunities elsewhere.
Eight recruiters, ranging across industries from financial services to human resources, told the Post that some candidates said they did not want to move to Hong Kong because of the protests that began in early June.
They have also received ­inquiries from local workers seeking to move to work elsewhere, again due to the protests.
Some said client firms were delaying on hiring until the city's unrest had settled down.
""I have definitely seen people not take roles because they or their partners from overseas have decided not to look at Hong Kong as an option, questioning its ­stability,"" said a consultant who works for a Hong Kong-based legal recruitment firm.
He added the shift in attitude had narrowed the pool of available talent.
What started out as a series of peaceful demonstrations against the now-shelved extradition bill initiated by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has ­expanded into anger over social problems, such as expensive housing, as well as the police's handling of the ­protests.
""Absolutely I see a massive slowdown"" of candidate interest in roles and new jobs, said Elaine Khoo, founder of EL Recruit, which hires for the human ­resources sector.
During a day of intense ­protests last month, Khoo said she did not receive any replies for a job advertisement posted online, which she noted ""has never ­happened in 12 years of recruitment"". People were concerned the protests would have an ­impact on the city's economic ­stability, she said.
Candidates have also become increasingly concerned about moving to Hong Kong from abroad, according to recruiters.
A global recruitment company that hires for the banking and financial sector and asked not to be named said it saw two recent deals collapse after candidates ­decided not to move to Hong Kong. A third looked close to ­falling through. Others were no longer interested in Hong Kong, particularly those from Singapore, it said.
Recruiters are also hearing from Hong Kong workers who want to work elsewhere, ­especially Singapore.
""It is a fair reflection to say it is getting to a position that people are saying if this is going to ­continue and there isn't a resolution, then maybe we should go [to Singapore],"" said Tom Bury, ­managing director for Odin Partners, which recruits for investment banks and hedge funds.
""The only thing that won't change is that people need to be in Hong Kong for business in China.""
He said a pattern had begun to emerge in which some candidates asked if ­Singapore would be an option, due to worries about their families' safety.
""People are starting to mull over if this is going to continue, asking 'do I need to think about a contingency?',"" he said.
Bury said that if the unrest continued until the end of the year and into the bonus season for bankers at the beginning of next year, he would expect to hear more requests to move.
A greater number of senior executives and expatriate workers than usual were looking at ­moving abroad, said Alex King, strategic partnership manager at ­Ambition, a global boutique ­recruitment business that covers industries including technology, banking and financial service and sales and marketing.
Similar conversations had also happened in human resources, Khoo said, and real estate, according to William Glover, managing director of real estate recruitment firm Macdonald and Co.
Meanwhile, some companies are holding back on hiring as they await a resolution to the protests and a return to stability in the city.
Roles had been put on hold ""in isolated incidences"" as things such as development projects were paused, while the release of flats for sale had slowed ""until there are better conditions"", ­Glover said.
The protests were bringing a global slowdown from the US-China trade war and Brexit ""into a sharper focus"", he said.
Since the unrest began, Khoo has seen two companies push back the starting date of new roles indefinitely, due to uncertainty about the safety of their employees, while another candidate was made redundant and given six months' compensation pay ­before even starting.
""Roles being pushed back is not common,"" she said. ""These past three months, they have been pushed to indefinite."""
South China Morning Post,2019-09-27,Protest song spreads the word in many languages,628 ,"
Popular protest anthem Gloryto Hong Kong, a crowdsourced composition sung by anti-government demonstrators and their supporters on the streets and in shopping malls, continues to take on a life of its own.
Composed by a Hong Kong musician known simply as ""Thomas"" and posted on YouTube in August, where it has since been viewed 2.2 million times,the song has been translatedinto ­many languages, includingJapanese, German, Italian andthe Taiwanese Hokkien Chinese ­dialect.
Several other video versions have been posted online, onefeaturing the Black Blorchestra, whose members perform wearing the gas masks and yellow helmets that are standard gear for frontline protesters - and shrouded in smoke that evokes tear gas, which police have often used as a crowd control measure since massprotests began in June against the now-abandoned extradition law.
The most recent versiongives voice to the deaf, with aperformance in sign language.
A key aim of the song is to rally and unify protesters, says amember of the 20-plus-strong team the composer recruited to produce it and who uses thepseudonym PI.
""The song encapsulates the shared ethos of Hongkongers: the progression starts by plunging into the current despair, and yet soldiering on and ultimately achieving the final, shared glory that belongs to Hong Kong,"" PI says.
Thomas, a musician in his mid-20s, began composing the song in early June. He was prompted by supporters of the movement, who donated safety gear to protesters. He wished to contribute to the cause by doing what he does best - making music - he says.
""A helmet can protect them from assaults for a while, but it is an iron will that proves to beultimately impenetrable. Theregime may beat us with batons, shoot us and even kill us, but no one can suppress Hongkongers' united will to fight for our freedom and democracy,"" Thomas says.
Choruses of Glory to Hong Kong break out spontaneously during protests, and it has been sung almost nightly at community sessions in neighbourhoods and shopping malls; people bring along instruments on which toaccompany singers. Many have memorised the lyrics, whichinclude the protest slogan""Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times"" - seen by opponents as a challenge to the mainland's sovereignty over the city.
A producer of one of the music videos, who goes by the name of WordArt, stresses the significance of the group singing sessions as a form of protest in which people can participate without fearing ­arrest. ""Protesters constantly feel insecure, since most of us have to act anonymously. You wouldn't know who's with you in the neighbourhood. Music, especially this song, creates a rather peaceful singalong occasion that reveals the size of the supporting crowd. You can actually hear the people and feel that they are standing with you,"" WordArt says.
Unlike other songs the protesters have sung, Glory to Hong Kong has a martial beat PI believes is better suited to the current tone of the movement.
""Boundless Oceans Vast Skies [by Hong Kong rockers Beyond] is largely a pop ballad. And SingHallelujah to the Lord was often heard during the early days of the protests, but carries culturalbaggage because it is a Christian hymn,"" PI says. ""A march fits, with its uniform rhythm matching the uniform steps of protesters. No more sentimental softness, but strength in determination.""
Mere singing, however, is not sufficient, says PI, echoing a common criticism of the community chorus as a means of resistance. It may be a rousing display of soft power and draw international attention to the political cause, but it puts no pressure on thegovernment, he says.
""The song is only meant as a 'buff', an encouragement and strengthening of the spirits, in preparation for the actions that need to be done."""
South China Morning Post,2019-10-17,Government 'wants middle-class property slaves',751 ,"
City protesters, who were ­nowhere in sight as Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor ­delivered her policy address ­yesterday amid the worst political unrest since 1997, accused her of trying to silence the middle class by enticing them into becoming homeowners.
The government wanted them to become property slaves, the protesters said, referring to a new initiative Lam announced to relax the ceiling on mortgage financing schemes for first-time homebuyers.
For those who are allowed to borrow up to 90 per cent of the ­value of a flat, the lending cap has been raised to HK$8 million from the existing HK$4 million.
For those able to take mortgages worth up to 80 per cent of the property value, the cap has been raised to HK$10 million from HK$6 million.
""Lam wants to fool the middle class into buying flats and becoming property slaves, so they would refrain from protesting as they do not want to see the property ­market plunge,"" a 30-year-old protester surnamed Yeung said.
""She is trying to solve political issues with economic measures, but it is impossible to resolve the citizens' discontent as long as she refuses to address the five ­demands.""
Yeung, an executive assistant, said she had no plans to own a flat despite the new measures, as she saw no future in the city given the current political climate.
She also argued that property prices would only be driven up further while the ordeal of the ­lower income groups would not be alleviated if rent controls were not put in place to curb unreasonable increases.
In withdrawing the bill last month, Lam addressed only one of the five demands of protesters. The others are amnesty for those arrested during protests, refraining from classifying protests as riots, an independent inquiry into police conduct and the implementation of universal suffrage.
Other protesters also poured scorn on Lam's policy blueprint on Reddit-like site LIHKG, which has become the virtual command centre of the months-long ­movement.
A user said it was a dangerous move for Lam to relax the mortgage ceilings as it was no different from encouraging citizens to ­become flat owners, and that this would put some in a difficult financial situation once the property bubble burst.
Others said it was naive of Lam's cabinet to believe protests would die down if more people became homeowners.
While discussion online was fierce and vocal, the black-clad protesters were nowhere to be seen outside or anywhere near the Legislative Council Complex, where Lam had been expected to deliver her policy address.
They were online celebrating as the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act was approved by the United States House of Representatives. It would impose sanctions against the city government if it was deemed to be acting against democratic freedoms.
The tight security outside ­Legco proved unnecessary, as protesters who showed up were mostly members of the League of Social Democrats, led by ousted lawmaker ""Long Hair"" Leung Kwok-hung.
Some protesters said online that it was better to ignore Lam and her policy address, which ""nobody cared about"".
Leung made a similar argument, saying the thin crowd showed that people did not take the chief executive seriously.
But Lam's attempt to deliver her third policy address in the chamber was soon interrupted by pan-democrats, who repeatedly heckled and jeered her.
The opposition lawmakers even used a handheld projector to beam the slogan ""five demands, not one less"" on the chief ­executive's face and on the wall behind her.
As she walked in, they also played an audio recording of ­gunshots and the screaming of protesters, which they said represented ""the hardship and pain"" felt by Hongkongers in ­recent months.
Legco president Andrew Leung Kwan-yuen at first suspended the sitting. It resumed soon after, only to be adjourned within minutes amid the chaos wrought by the pan-democrats.
Lam eventually delivered her policy blueprint via video - a first for the city.
Lawmaker Martin Liao Cheung-kong, convenor of the pro-establishment bloc, ­denounced the pan-democrats' antics as ""totally unforgivable"".
""The chief executive came to deliver the policy address and Legco is under a constitutional duty to hear and discuss it. That has been prevented for no good reason,"" he said.
But his opponents shrugged off the accusations.
""Our duty is to bring the voice of Hong Kong's people into the legislature. This morning we did exactly that,"" said Council Front lawmaker Claudia Mo ­Man-ching.

South China Morning Post,2019-10-14,"Security chief refuses to quit over failure to end violence John Lee defends police, saying force is",523 ,"
Hong Kong's security chief has said the government cannot ­escape responsibility for the ­protest crisis, but he refused to step down over its failure to stem the violence plaguing the city.
In an interview with TVB yesterday, Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu said he would stay on to bring an end to the large-scale unrest, which has reached new heights since an anti-mask law came into force.
The city has been roiled by more than four months of anti-government protests sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill.
""For the current social and political problems, of course the government has an unshakeable responsibility,"" he said.
Asked if he would resign over the crisis, he said: ""As an official, at present the most important ­responsibility for me is to curb the serious violence in Hong Kong ... I have emphasised many times that I'll continue to stay on to fulfil my duty.""
Lee's remarks came as the protests showed little sign of easing. Soon after the interview was broadcast, protesters staged flash mob demonstrations across the city, attacking shops with mainland links and reportedly throwing objects onto railway tracks.
Earlier in the day, protesters scaled Lion Rock peak and hoisted a statue called ""Lady Liberty"".
The 4½-metre statue, which weighs 80kg and is adorned with protest accessories such a gas mask, was carried up the 500- ­metre peak during an overnight thunderstorm by several dozen demonstrators, some wearing head lamps.
An inquiry into the police use of force against protesters is one of five demands from anti-government activists.
Among widespread complaints about the police's handling of the demonstrations, the Hong Kong Journalists Association has condemned what it called the ­""indiscriminate"" use of force by officers against reporters.
Indonesian journalist Veby Mega Indah, a 39-year-old ­associate editor with Suara Hong Kong News, was hit by what her lawyer believed to be a rubber bullet when she was covering the city's ongoing unrest on September 29 clothed in full press gear.
However, Lee strongly defended the force, saying it had been caught in the middle and was bearing the brunt of the public's mounting discontent.
""I entirely agree that we shouldn't rely on the police for ­resolving the current problems. But at this stage we need police to contain the violence,"" he said.
Lee pointed out the ongoing political conflict had caused serious rifts in society. ""The police force is being caught in the crossfire and become the centre of attention,"" he said.
Lee also questioned why society had focused on the use of force by police, but failed to raise concerns about rampaging violence by radical protesters, who have vandalised public facilities such as MTR stations.
Separately, Secretary for ­Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah has tried to reassure people the new anti-mask law would not have much of an impact on their daily lives.
""If a member of the public in a public place is asked by police ­officers to remove the face covering to verify his identity, he may wear it again after the verification process is completed,"" she wrote on her official blog yesterday.

South China Morning Post,2019-11-18,CY urges public to stand up to violence,572 ,"
Former Hong Kong leader Leung Chun-ying has reportedly urged members of the public not to be cowed by the ongoing violencein the city as he insists policeactions have deterred frontline anti-government protesters.
The comments by Leung - now a vice-chairman of the ­Chinese People's Political ­Consultative Conference, the country's top advisory body - were made to a group of 200 Hongkongers in Shanghai and came as pro-Beijing heavyweight Jasper Tsang Yok-sing renewed his calls for the government to pardon some protesters who had committed less serious crimes.
Leung told the group on ­Saturday that society should be ""brave enough"" to stand up to ­violence and should not ""waver"" as he argued it was still more likely ""for one to get hit by a car than a violent rioter"". According to one of those who attended the meeting, he also suggested the number of frontline protesters had dwindled, proving police's actions had brought a deterrent effect.
Leung's more hardline approach was in stark contrast to Tsang, who revealed in an interview with French online media outlet Mediapart that he hadsuggested the government grant an amnesty to protesters arrested for less serious crimes. But Tsang, president of the LegislativeCouncil between 2012 and 2016, believed the city's leader waslikely to listen to ""hardliners"" who were against such a proposal.
As one of their five coredemands, protesters have called for the unconditional releaseof those arrested during the demonstrations.
""You can't pardon very serious crimes,"" said Tsang, a stalwart of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB), the city's biggestpro-Beijing party. ""But many of those arrested did not commit serious crimes.""
Since June, more than 4,000 people had been arrested in ­connection with the protests.
Under his proposal, Tsang said Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor should drawa deadline after which furtherviolence would not be pardoned.
But the veteran politician said some in the pro-establishment camp were against the idea of an amnesty and believed it would only lead to more violence. Tsang said he did not agree with thesentiment but that the chief executive ""listens to the hardliners"".
Earlier this month, Lam said the government would not grant an amnesty to those who had not yet been prosecuted because it was against the principle of the rule of law.
Her deputy, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, said the city's leader could reduce sentences, but only after there had been a trial. ""The chief executive cannot order the Department of Justice to prosecute someone, or not prosecute someone,"" he said.
In the interview, published on November 5, Tsang also said ­almost all of the 20 people who attended a recent closed-door meeting at Government House, Lam's official residence, advised the chief executive to set up a commission of inquiry - another key demand of protesters.
He said the DAB also madethe same suggestion to Lam in private, but the party could not ""go public with anything they know the government cannot do"".
While Tsang did not elaborate on the scope of the independent probe, protesters have calledfor police to be investigated forallegedly abusing their power during demonstrations.
Tsang said the chief executive rejected the suggestion, citingresistance from police and the need to maintain morale among officers. Tsang's office yesterday acknowledged the authenticity of his comments."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-25,protesters fail to disrupt airport access Activists call attempts to stall traffic or overcrowd tran,619 ,"
Anti-government protesters, who failed in their plan to jam airport-bound traffic yesterday morning, have vowed to make a comeback next weekend.
Transport officials and police had mapped out elaborate contingency plans to tackle any potential disruptions around Hong Kong International Airport yesterday morning. An extended injunction was also granted to prevent obstructions at one of the world's busiest aviation hubs.
But though the protesters had planned to skirt the legal order, which only covered roads within or near Chek Lap Kok island where the airport complex is located, they did not have enough peers show up to stall traffic or overcrowd transport by the scheduled starting time - 7am.
Later in the day, a group called ""Stuck with you"" issued a message on chat application Telegram thanking their supporters for carrying out ""tests"". It said the aim of the action was to make aviation workers late for work.
""Our plan this time was inadequate ... The Airport Authority adjusted people's working times and 7am was surely too early. But the test results are very useful,"" the post read.
""This event shows that popo [police], the government and the Airport Authority cared so much about our plans and had alternate preparations ready.""
It pledged to organise another similar event next Sunday.
Initially, the protesters had planned to jam roads by cars and bikes, while also packing airport-bound buses, the Tung Chung Line and the Airport Express. But their plans had little impact on traffic. There were also reports that police officers intercepted drivers in neighbouring Sunny Bay and cyclists in Tung Chung.
""The number of people who showed up today is a lot fewer than I expected,"" said Eric Chan, a medical worker who came at about 7am. ""Maybe Hong Kong people just can't help being late,"" he said in jest.
By 11am, the intended end time, the disruption plans died down, with protesters evaluating the movement both online and offline.
Kelvin, a 24-year-old apprentice worker, was in Tung Chung station with about 20 other protesters discussing their next move.
He said the low turnout was either because the scheduled time was too early, or because the airport had issued an injunction, or because people were planning to take part in the afternoon protest in Kwun Tong instead.
""For me, no matter what protest action is next, we just need to keep doing everything possible to ensure the movement does not cool down,"" he said.
Despite the little impact on the traffic, some passengers chose to set off earlier to the airport.
Wouter Geutjes, 35, a native of Amsterdam working in Hong Kong, arrived at the airport at 7.30am for his 12.20pm flight. ""I just adjusted my time to ensure that I arrived early,"" he said.
Harry Ho, 25, said he set out about an hour earlier than usual for a 10.50am flight to Japan in anticipation of delays from protests, which he described as only a ""minor inconvenience"".
""I agree with the protesters to some extent, but just don't affect us too much,"" he said. ""Their actions are quite effective in attracting attention because it's related to the airport.""
Chris Cheung, an airport employee, chose not to leave earlier for work. ""I wouldn't mind even if the protest affects my commute because the things they [the protesters] want to achieve matter more,"" he said.
Staff at the Airport Express in Central deployed more employees to guide passengers to trains. At the Express stop in the airport, security officers were on standby.
The disruptions were part of months of protests that have hit the city, aimed at forcing the government to respond to demands including the formal withdrawal of the now-shelved extradition bill and ­setting up an inquiry into the police's use of force."
South China Morning Post,2019-09-12,Safety fears force MTR to axe overnight holiday services Safety fears force MTR to axe overnight ser,559 ,"
The MTR Corp will cancel ­overnight services during the Mid-­Autumn Festival for the first time ever, citing safety concerns amid escalating protest violence at its stations, the Post has learned.
The revelation came as anti-government demonstrators flocked to shopping malls across the city last night, belting out their newest protest anthem, Glory to Hong Kong, a day after it struck a chord with soccer fans at the Hong Kong Stadium.
The musical renditions, the latest form of defiance used by the ever-evolving protest movement, were planned for a number of districts from about 8pm, the first starting at 7pm at Amoy Plaza in Kowloon Bay.
Protesters took their chanting and singing to Plaza Hollywood in Diamond Hill, Festival Walk in Kowloon Tong and Moko in Mong Kok, among others.
Many held their phones with flashlights on outside shopping centres.
The biggest gathering was at New Town Plaza in Sha Tin, the scene of violent clashes between protesters and police two months ago.
Officers were also out patrolling MTR stations to prevent any protest vandalism.
The MTR Corp management and government officials met yesterday afternoon to discuss providing alternative transport for commuters.
Sources said the MTR would offer to boost the frequency of trains beyond peak hours, also extending service hours instead of keeping them running throughout Friday night.
The unprecedented move, backed by the MTR's staff union, is aimed at heading off large gatherings at stations by people carrying metallic balloons that could short-circuit power lines and traditional candlelit lanterns which could pose a fire hazard, given the risk of chaotic protest action.
""We urged the MTR management to cancel the overnight services on this occasion, which we think is a high-risk one,"" said Tam Kin-chiu, vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Railway Trade Unions, after meeting operations director Adi Lau Tin-shing.
""We can no longer afford to have key interchanges vandalised again.""
Tam said the managementwould scrap the round-the-clock services during the Mid-Autumn Festival for security reasons.
Prince Edward, Mong Kok and Yau Ma Tei stations have had to be repeatedly closed because of escalating violence by radical protesters trashing the premises or clashing with riot police.
The city's metro stations have become prime targets of radicals, who have turned their wrath on the MTR Corp, accusing it of working with the government and police force against protesters.
Overnight MTR services are normally available four times a year - during the Mid-Autumn Festival, Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve and the night before the Lunar New Year.
In the past month, MTR stations have suffered, with rampaging groups smashing CCTV cameras, Octopus card readers, ticketing machines, glass doors, turnstiles and station control rooms. They have frequently set off fire extinguishers and fire hosepipes in the stations when confronting police.
The union has warned that some stations may not be able to survive more attacks.
""We have carried out urgent repairs of damaged facilities by replacing them with components from undamaged stations, but we will soon run out of them,"" Tam said.
The rail operator has started calling police to remove rowdy demonstrators from its premises, and closing stations in advance when getting wind of protests, to avoid chaos and vandalism."

The only extradition bill protester to deliberately reveal his face in the main chamber of Hong Kong's ­legislature as he urged ­others to stay after storming the building has fled the city, a source told the Post yesterday.
It was not immediately clear where Brian Leung Kai-ping, 25, had gone, as he refused to confirm his whereabouts when contacted. The Post earlier published an ­exclusive interview with Leung following the July 1 takeover of the Legislative Council.
Yesterday, Leung said: ""I have nothing to say at this time. I'm still considering various options.""
Pressed on whether he was already in the US to continue his doctorate at the University of Washington, he added: ""I'm still seeking legal advice.""
The source said Leung was clearly aware of the risk of being arrested after the July 1 protests, and had not made up his mind on whether he would come back.
On the 22nd anniversary of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule, as hundreds of thousands took to the streets in a pro-democracy march, young protesters surrounded Legco in a siege that would end in the storming of the complex that night.
Protesters had defaced Legco and Leung was the only one to remove his mask in front of cameras, urging a group to stay in the chamber as police closed in on the site. Eventually, all demonstrators left the scene.
Since then, a total of 12 suspects - 11 men and a woman, aged 14 to 36 - were arrested for offences including possession of offensive weapons, unlawful assembly, assaulting a police officer, obstructing an officer, violation of the air navigation order, and failing to produce identity cards.
Hong Kong and the United States have an extradition treaty, but even if Leung had indeed fled there, it was unclear if local authorities would submit a request to have him returned to the city, or whether the American government would accept the demand.
On the night of July 1, as protesters broke windows and left graffiti on Legco walls, Leung had stepped on a lawmaker's desk, removed his mask and asked others to stay behind.
""The more people here, the safer we are. Let's stay and occupy the chamber, we can't lose any more,"" he shouted at the time. But he eventually gave up as most protesters chose to leave and police readied for a clearance operation.
In an interview with the Post via Telegram call on July 3, Leung refused to disclose whether he was still in Hong Kong, but conceded he might not be able to fly to the US this September.
""While I am not yet a political dissident in exile, that is a real threat ahead of me and my peers if the government chooses to press charges against all who entered Legco,"" he said in the interview.
On the recent unrest, security minister John Lee Ka-chiu accused protesters of committing serious offences, including forced entry into Legco and possession of weapons."
South China Morning Post,2019-10-21,"Marauding mob launches eight-hour arson spree Mainland-linked stores, police and MTR stations are on",764 ,"
Protesters went on a rampage ­yesterday, hurling petrol bombs and setting ablaze multiple stores along Kowloon's main thoroughfare, as police fired tear gas and water cannons which sprayedthe entrance of the city's biggest mosque with blue dye, fuelling tensions in the area.
The mob's arson attacks ­began at about 3pm and lasted for more than eight hours as they set fires inside mainland-linked businesses and police and MTR stations, before gutting a Xiaomi shop and Chinese traditional medicine store Tong Ren Tang in Mong Kok.
As the city marked the 20th weekend of violent protests, demonstrators kicked off an ­illegal march in Tsim Sha Tsui peacefully­, but the initial calm ­dissipated in less than two hours as marauding protesters began blocking roads and throwing bricks and petrol bombs.
Kowloon Mosque and Chungking Mansions had been on high alert ahead of the march amid fears there would be retribution against the city's ethnic minority groups after Civil Human Rights Front's convenor Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit was attacked by people described to be of South Asian ­descent last Wednesday.
While protesters steered clear of the place of worship, the mosque's gates ended up being soaked in the blue solution used by the police's water cannon that went up and down Nathan Road several times firing randomly at no one in particular or at groups of bystanders and journalists.
""I don't understand why dye was sprayed on the mosque as there were not many people around,"" said Mohammed ­Sadeque, 34, who came from Kolkata, India, to settle in the city 12 years ago. But he appreciated fellow Hongkongers who helped clean up afterwards.
The Civil Human Rights Front condemned police use of water cannon on the mosque, calling the action ""totally unnecessary"".
Later in the night, Ho Yun-sing, district commander of the Yau Mong Tsim visited the mosque to meet the imam. The tens of thousands of protesters - organisers claimed an estimated 350,000 - began the march equipped with banners and umbrellas from Salisbury Garden in Tsim Sha Tsui towards the West Kowloon terminus of the high-speed rail link, which was heavily guarded by police.
But before long, the protesters headed north to Sham Shui Po along Canton and Nathan roads, as radicals forced open the shutters of shops and banks with mainland links and began trashing them and setting fire to several, including a Bank of China branch.
Apart from the branches of Best Mart 360 - which had been target of vandalism after beingaccused of having ties with the so-called Fujian gangs that had allegedly beaten protesters in the past - the Mong Kok branch of Tong Ren Tang was also smashed and its medicine cabinets ransacked before protesters returned to set the store on fire.
In Yau Ma Tei, an elderly man accused of stealing at least three mobile phones from a trashedXiaomi store was tied up byprotesters who insisted they did not condone looting.
A tense stand-off also erupted near the Park Lane Shoppers' Boulevard as protesters repeatedly hurled petrol bombs at Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station as officers fired rounds of tear gas at them from inside.
Protesters also cut down a surveillance camera near a Yau Ma Tei MTR exit with an electric chainsaw, before setting it on fire. A traffic light control box was also set alight.
They then threw petrol bombs inside at least four MTR stations through the closed exits - forcing the partial suspension of the Tsuen Wan line and the closure of at least 14 stations.
After nightfall, a bomb ­disposal robot - believed to be ­first deployed since the protests began - detonated a suspected explosive device inside a cardboard box placed at the intersection of Lai Chi Kok Road and Tong Mi Road in Tai Kok Tsui.
In Mong Kok, riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the mob, but later appeared uncertain whether to continue their actions. As they retreated, protesters threw bricks at their vehicles, breaking the windows. Police then returned to clash again with the mob, before retreating asecond time.
Police also said two men, aged 31 and 34, were arrested for ­""possession of an offensive weapon"" in Tai Po and on suspicion of ""supplying weapons"" to protesters in Kowloon yesterday. Weapons including 42 suspected petrol bombs and raw materials for creating paintballs were found in the boot of two vehicles - a taxi and a seven-seater car- during a search.
Meanwhile, Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor is set to leave forJapan today to attend tomorrow's enthronement ceremony ofEmperor Naruhito.

South China Morning Post,2019-10-05,Date set for Lam's policy address and official withdrawal of extradition bill,462 ,"
The city's embattled leader will hold her policy address on ­October 16, followed by an official withdrawal of the extradition bill, which has sparked nearly four months of protests and political turmoil in the city.
The date of Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor's third policy address was confirmed in a paper issued by the Legislative Council and circulated among lawmakers yesterday.
The new Legco session would resume three months after ­protesters stormed the Legco building on July 1 and brought an early end to the previous round.
According to the Legco paper, Lam will present her annual ­policy blueprint at 11am on ­the day.
Immediately after her speech, Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu will make an announcement to withdraw the hated ­extradition bill.
On October 17, there will be a 90-minute session for lawmakers to raise questions for Lam on the policy address.
Lam announced on September 4 that the government would formally withdraw the bill in an attempt to quell the social unrest.
According to the Legco Rules of Procedure, the announcement has to be made in a council ­meeting.
Starry Lee Wai-king, chairwoman of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, ­expressed concern that the meeting would not smoothly ­resume owing to concerns ­protesters would again besiege the complex.
""There are lots of livelihood policies yet to be scrutinised in Legco ... I hope radicals will not continue their violent acts,"" Lee said.
The Democratic Party's Ted Hui Chi-fung said chaos and protests were expected to erupt that day. ""I have doubts whether the meeting will be held. Protesters are expected to grasp the chance and press for their unaddressed calls,"" he said. ""Even if the meeting goes ahead, I think pan-democrats should launch protests inside the chamber.""
Unmet demands include setting up an inquiry into police use of force and implementation of universal suffrage.
The Legco complex was trashed by protesters on the 22nd anniversary of the city's return to Chinese rule. It was the first time Legco had been forcibly taken over by protesters, who broke more than 60 glass doors and panes, sprayed graffiti on walls, and damaged the complex's fire prevention and security systems.
The secretariat recently told lawmakers that renovation work was mostly completed, but glass installations on the ground floor could only be replaced by next February. Legco president ­Andrew Leung Kwan-yuen earlier said repairs would cost more than HK$40 million.
Meanwhile, all eyes will be on Lam's coming policy address, regarded as her chance to show her administration's commitment to tackle deep-rooted issues in the city, with the ongoing political crisis showing no signs of abating.

A citywide protest plunged Hong Kong into transport chaosyesterday, crippling train, busand cross-border services and making it difficult for millions of commuters to get to and from work.
The turmoil was expected to persist today as defiant protesters vowed to keep fighting after a21-year-old student was shotand critically wounded by a police officer yesterday morning.
The embattled MTR Corporation was once again badly affected as protesters vandalised the rail giant's facilities from early morning. The company said over the course of the day, 32 MTR stations had been forced to close and service on certain sections of several railway lines had to be suspended.
After 7pm, the Airport Express would only run between Hong Kong station and the airport.
The problems started before 6am after MTR staff found objects including bicycles and ladders thrown onto the tracks between Sha Tin and Tai Wai on the East Rail Line.
At 7am, a petrol bomb was hurled at Tung Chung station and a fire set at Heng On station.
Protesters were out in force during the morning rush hour, setting up roadblocks and ­disrupting rail services, as the anti-government protests ­entered their sixth month.
They retreated for a while, but emerged across the city again after the shooting in Sai Wan Ho.
An MTR spokesman said at about 8am in Kwai Fong station, two petrol bombs were throwninside a Central-bound train when its doors opened for passengers to get on and off.
At the same time, some people activated emergency escapes at the end of the train, he said.
""The platform staff immediately used extinguishers to put out the fire and then evacuated the passengers,"" he said.
""We express our indignation and strongly condemn such acts.""
Major thoroughfares across several districts were blocked,resulting in the suspension of 48 cross-harbour bus routes and 91 other routes.
Trams on the Shau Kei Wan Terminus-Finnie Street route, as well as from Admiralty to Western Market Terminus did not runyesterday afternoon.
Despite widespread irritation over the disruptions, some Hongkongers were supportive.
A secondary school pupilsurnamed Luk realised in the morning she could not find a tram to her school in Sai Wan Ho so she decided to join the strike.
""It is exam week so I didn't take leave although I wanted to join the strike, but because the road was blocked, I told the school I could not make it in,"" she said.
In Sha Tin, residents on Tai Chung Kiu Road decided to walk to Sha Tin MTR station because protesters had blocked the road."
South China Morning Post,2019-07-17,"don't stand in way of rally, police warned Civil Human Rights Front says that if force denies them t",763 ,"
Organisers planning another mass march against Hong Kong's embattled government this ­weekend have warned police that denying them a permit to proceed would effectively mean imposing a curfew on the city after the force asked them yesterday to ­postpone the protest because of safety concerns.
The Civil Human Rights Front, which organised two mass protests that drew historic numbers onto the streets in June against the now-suspended extradition bill, said it wanted to hold the next march on Saturday or Sunday, rather than push it back to August as requested by police.
The two sides met hours after the Security Bureau denied reports that the government was looking into declaring a curfew and banning demonstrations following unprecedented protest violence in Sha Tin last Sunday that left at least 28 protesters, ­police and journalists injured.
""The government will continue to follow the existing mechanism requiring notification to the police and the Letter of No Objection. Apart from this, the government has no other plans,"" a spokesman said.
The front's planned march would be a major protest among a series in the pipeline, including a social workers' silent march from Wan Chai to the Chief Executive's Office on Sunday, rallies against Chinese state-owned publishers at the Hong Kong Book Fair today, and demonstrations in Mong Kok, Hung Hom, Western district and Tseung Kwan O in the coming weekends.
Front convenor Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit said rather than suggesting a postponement, police should allow them to go ahead with the march from Causeway Bay to the city's administrative and legislative centre in Admiralty or the Court of Final Appeal in Central on Saturday or Sunday.
""They hope we will reschedule the march to August due to public safety concerns,"" Sham said.
""But if police are handling controversies by withholding a Letter of No Objection from us, they are just responding to ­people's human rights demands by further suppressing them.""
Sham said he would follow up with police at another meeting ­today.
Some users of popular online forum LIHKG suggested they would escalate protest action on July 21 as Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor had failed to respond to their calls for a complete withdrawal of the bill, among other demands, by July 14.
Asked about the possibility of violence after the main march, because of the pattern of clashes after peaceful rallies, front vice-convenor Figo Chan Ho-wun said it would depend on factors such as the government's response to people's demands and how ­police handled the crowd.
The group had originally planned a rally on Tim Mei Avenue outside government headquarters on July 21, but expanded it into a march, after organisers of another protest on the same day cancelled their plan, apparently in a show of solidarity with the front.
The weekend march will call for the appointment of a judge-led inquiry into the use of force by police against protesters as well as the total withdrawal of the unpopular bill, which would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to the mainland and other jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has no extradition deal.
The police request for a postponement came after frontline officers warned top brass they were reaching breaking point in the face of constant clashes with protesters. At least 47 people were arrested over the violence at Sha Tin's New Town Plaza shopping centre after a peaceful protest that drew 115,000 people, according to organisers.
There was tension at the mall again yesterday as an angry crowd besieged the customer service desk for a second night in a row.
They were demanding answers and a meeting withthe management, refusing to accept mall owner Sun Hung Kai Properties' denial that it had called police to remove the protesters when they fled from the streets of Sha Tin last Sunday and entered the shopping centre where they fought running battles with officers in riot gear.
Local resident Yeow Wai-chung said she had been chased by riot police that night even though she did not take part in the protest. ""How do I know if it is safe to come to the mall?"" she said.
Lam continued to lobby support from her pro-establishment allies yesterday, meeting rural group Heung Yee Kuk, whose chairman, Kenneth Lau Ip keung, said they had raised concerns about the escalating anti-government protests.
""Stability and safety are the basic elements for the success of Hong Kong. If we lose these elements, Hong Kong will lose a lot of development opportunities,"" said Lau, also a lawmaker and an ­adviser in Lam's cabinet.

South China Morning Post,2019-07-20,The art of protest Hong Kong has been rocked by waves of protests against the government's controver,1299 ,"
The origin of the Lennon Wall
The colourful walls get their name indirectly from one of the most famous figures in popular music, John Lennon, who was also an anti-war activist in his later life. The ­original Lennon Wall sprang up spontaneously in his ­honour in Prague following his assassination on December 8, 1980. Lennon's pacifist anthems recorded during his solo career after the break-up of The Beatles, such as Give Peace a Chance and Imagine, became anthems for anti-war movements across the world. The latter, with the lyrics ""imagine all the people, living life in peace"", was also sung during the 2014 Occupy protests in Hong Kong.
After Lennon's death, an unknown artist painted a ­picture of him and some lyrics on a wall located in a ­secluded square across from the French embassy in Prague. At the time, Western music and symbols were ­repressed and sometimes banned in the country, then still known as Czechoslovakia and behind the iron curtain, and the image of Lennon was essentially a form of protest. The Czech ­secret police, the StB, quickly painted over the wall, but the original image of Lennon triggered an unstoppable ­deluge of anti-communist graffiti.
After the peaceful toppling of the communist regime in November 1989 during the ""Velvet Revolution"", the wall became a popular - and ever evolving - site for calls to ­activism worldwide and a vibrant landmark in the city.
In November 2014, on the 25th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, the wall was painted over in white by a group of student artists, leaving behind only the words ""wall is over"". But the wall did not remain blank for long, with the graffiti and messages soon returning.
In April, the Czech Republic branch of Extinction ­Rebellion, a climate activist group, repainted the Lennon Wall with the words klimatické nouze, which mean climate emergency in Czech.
Hong Kong has been rocked by waves of protests against the government's extradition bill since June. But while opposition to the now-suspended bill has at times been fierce, the episode has also inspired many Hongkongers to express themselves in a quieter, more creative way. Since last week, displays of colourful sticky notes have sprouted up across the city, making international headlines. Known as Lennon Walls, the displays made up of anti-bill messages and other protest statements have transformed entire underpasses, pedestrian bridges and even shopfronts into multicoloured billboards. Zoe Low takes a closer look at how the protest movement has become a major source of inspiration for the creation of art and memes.
How did the Lennon Wall become a site of protest art inHong Kong?
In Hong Kong, the Lennon Wall first appeared in 2014 on an outdoor staircase leading to the headquarters of the city government. As police began to clear protesters who had been occupying Admiralty, an online version of the ­Lennon Wall appeared.
Students in Causeway Bay also constructed a miniature Lennon Wall in December that year.After police used tear gas on protesters, crowds grew and began spreading and occupying other areas, including the shopping hub of Causeway Bay and even Nathan Road in Mong Kok.
Last month, the Lennon Wall in Admiralty quickly ­reappeared at the same location as in 2014 after a million people marched on June 9. Among the posts were ­messages such as ""Hong Kong add oil"", ""Carrie Lam step down"" and ""My dear, democracy is a good thing"", along with caricatures of police, who had pepper-sprayed, ­tear-gassed and fired rubber bullets at protesters.
As the protests continued, more and more of the colourful walls began to spring up across Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and beyond, even as far as away some of the outlying islands. The biggest are in Tai Po, Causeway Bay and Austin. Outside Hong Kong, Lennon Walls sprang up in Toronto, Tokyo, Berlin and London, to name a just few examples.
There is even a Lennon Clock in Vancouver's Gastown, where supporters have left notes on a steam-powered clock that rings every 15 minutes.
The walls are also a place for people to gather and ­commiserate. A video on Twitter shows a group at the ­Lennon Wall in an underpass near Tai Po Market station singing one of the unofficial anthems of the protests, Under a Vast Sky by the Canto-rock band Beyond.
But the walls have also been met with anger in some places, with supporters of Beijing and the police ­attempting to strip away the messages. This has led to ­altercations and the arrest of several people.
More than 200 police in riot gear also visited the Lennon Wall in Tai Po on July 10 to remove posters that disclosed the identities and personal details of some officers.
How does one piece of art inspire the creation of others in the movement? Police actions in Tai Po gave yet more inspiration to ­activists - including the creation of numerous online memes. One was a parody of the poster for the new Lion King film, since the Cantonese term for arresting people sounds similar to ""lion"" in English, and in Cantonese, ­tearing paper is a homonym for the Cantonese name for the lion.
The memes have also appeared on Lennon Walls as Hongkongers turn to humour to vent their frustration. One popular installation at the Lennon Walls are posters of Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor next to a hanging flip-flop, allowing passers-by to strike her likeness with the shoe. The practice derives from the tradition of ""villain hitting"", where people can pay a woman to curse their enemies as they hit paper figures with an old shoe.
The walls have also become a means of ­communication. Large QR codes invite people to ""scan for the latest travel tips"" but they actually provide links to a website explaining the anti-extradition protests written in simplified Chinese. The use of the script prevalent on the mainland suggests these are aimed at visitors from across the border. Due to censorship on the mainland, many ­ there are unaware of the events unfolding to the south.
Additionally, protesters also turned the window of a ­Yoshinoya restaurant outlet into a Lennon Wall, after the pro-government boss of the Japanese chain's local ­franchise pulled a Facebook post that made fun of police for removing notes on a wall.
Marvin Hung Ming-kei, the chief executive of the Hong Kong-listed Hop Hing Group that runs the Yoshinoya ­restaurants across the border, told mainland media he was outraged at the post, which he was not informed of in ­advance. During a protest in Sha Tin on Sunday, a ­Yoshinoya ­outlet boarded up its windows and doors with plywood, and protesters used it to post messages and memes.
Some messages read ""rats inside"" and ""boycott"", while others drew a policeman as a Chikuya, a popular Japanese food called Si Zi Gau in Cantonese, the literal meaning of which is ""lion dog"". The name also sounds similar to ""a dog that tore paper"" in Cantonese.
The walls have also become a place to display protest art. Well-executed examples have been a staple of Hong Kong protests since 2014, with London's celebrated ­Victoria and Albert Museum featuring several pieces of art from the Occupy Central movement in a special exhibition called ""Disobedient Objects"".
This year, art featuring four sets of walking legs against a black background offered a poignant reminder of the four people who took their own lives, citing their opposition to the extradition bill. ""We will continue on for the four of you,"" reads the text above the image.
Other art includes caricatures of Carrie Lam and the ­police, while others drew the famous Lion Rock with the words ""Hong Kong add oil"" written down its face.
With more protests planned, the protesters' anger shows no sign of abating, but there is at least one thing Hong Kong can be sure of - there will be no shortage of ­inspiration for local artists and creators."
South China Morning Post,2019-09-02,"Protesters create airport travel chaos Masked radicals go on rampage outside terminal building, then",920 ,"
Anti-government protesters brought chaos and vandalism to Hong Kong's international airport again yesterday, blocking access routes, forcing travellers to walk part of the way, crippling train ­services and prompting a shutdown of the Tung Chung line by trashing the station.
Their action, a ""stress-test"" campaign they called ""suck with you"" to force the government to respond to their demands after months of sustained demonstrations, caused airlines to delay and cancel flights, and left travellers with few options of getting to the airport or leaving it for the city.
With transport in disarray as masked radicals prevented from entering the airport by a court ­injunction went on the rampage outside the terminal building, desperate travellers arriving in Hong Kong were forced to walk on the main road, lugging their suitcases all the way to Tung Chung and then onto the North Lantau Highway to Sunny Bay. The ­distance from the airport to Tung Chung is about 5km, while Sunny Bay is a further 13km away from the town.
Alongside these travellers were black-shirted protesters who had earlier caused mayhem ­outside the airport. Others ­managed to get onto airport buses that were leaving.
Yesterday's protests followed a night of violence in the city after tens of thousands joined an illegal march during the day that ­descended into pitched battles with riot police who used tear gas and water cannons.
Live rounds were also fired by officers in desperate moments when they were under attack by violent mobs on Saturday.
While the protesters' actions disrupted travellers who were ­arriving or leaving the city, they did not succeed in paralysing the airport, unlike three weeks ago.
On August 12 and 13, protesters crippled one of the world's busiest aviation hubs, causing 979 flights to be cancelled. They also shocked international travellers by detaining and assaulting two mainlanders in the departure hall.
Protesters this time vented most of their rage on the MTR, as they trashed Tung Chung station, smashing up the control room, dismantling CCTV cameras, ­jamming turnstiles so they could get in without paying, hacking at fire hoses to bring water gushing out and spray-painting graffiti.
MTR staff watched helplessly, too intimidated to challenge them.
Saturday's violent protests ended with elite Special Tactical Squad police chasing protesters into Prince Edward station and beating and pepper spraying them on a train.
While police said they were targeting hardcore protesters who had changed their clothes to ­mingle with other commuters after vandalising the station, ­supporters of the anti-government movement saw it as ­indiscriminate violence.
Riding on a wave of anger over the train beatings, protesters ­yesterday began descending upon the airport's bus terminal at about lunchtime.
They proceeded to build ­barricades of luggage trolleys and metal fences at the airport bus ­station in a bid to stop traffic on the main road to the two ­terminals.
They set off fire extinguishers at one terminal, smashed surveillance cameras and damaged ­luggage trolleys. Outside another part of the terminal, one group had wheeled in a row of dumpsters and tipped them to one side to let the rubbish out as barricades against the riot police.
Protesters then smashed the glass doors of a fire hose and ­proceeded to wet the road in front of the barricades to make it too slippery for police to advance.
Next they moved onto the roads, setting up more barricades which they later lit up into a blaze.
While riot police appeared at several points to be moving in on them, the protesters managed to flee and leave the airport - at times, seemingly uncertain if they would return - for Tung Chung.
Along the way, they lobbed bricks and metal poles over ­fencing separating the highway from the tracks of the Airport ­Express. The MTR said that was dangerous enough to force the suspension of airport train ­services.
Local resident Chandran Nair was struck by the sight of the ­protesters walking along the road, and the ""staggering number"" of metal pipes they were carrying, while his bus was stuck for hours in the jam they had caused.
""Everyone on the bus was ­petrified to make eye contact with all the people in black shirts. I've never been on a bus in Hong Kong that was so quiet,"" he said.
While wreaking havoc at the station, and assaulting commuters who objected to their actions, the mobs also blocked multiple roads in Tung Chung, set fire to barricades and paralysed traffic.
At the Tung Chung swimming pool, protesters set the national flag on fire in another display of defiance against Beijing, which has repeatedly condemned such acts as an attack on sovereignty.
When the MTR ordered the station to be closed just before 6pm, protesters rushed out and held the shutters open to allow their comrades to leave.
Before long, the MTR shut down not just Tung Chung ­station, but the entire line, along with the Disneyland Resort line, apparently in an attempt to ­prevent the protesters from moving about easily.
By the time police arrived, they had fled the scene, and were left to their own devices to get out of the town with transport paralysed by their actions.
In the end, police stood facing angry residents who made it clear they did not want them around.
""Gangsters go home!"" they yelled, hurling abuse at officers.
When an egg was thrown in their direction, one frustrated officer yelled back, ""Very well, let them [protesters] destroy everything in Tung Chung!""

South China Morning Post,2019-08-13,Police show water cannons as tensions grip city Controversial anti-riot vehicles are ready for use o,648 ,"
Hong Kong police showed off controversial new anti-riot ­vehicles yesterday, as angry ­protests continued to grip the city.
The custom-built French trucks were ready to hit the city streets, a police source said.
Nineteen lawmakers from the legislature's security panel were at the Police Tactical Unit base in Fanling when officers demonstrated the vehicles' use.
The force has dealt with weeks of public order incidents, as anti-government protesters have ­occupied roads and besieged ­police stations, actions sparked by anger at now-abandoned extradition legislation.
Officers used the cannons on dummies at the lowest and highest water pressures, at distances between 20 and 40 metres.
Asked whether the vehicles were ready for deployment, the unit's deputy commander, Chan Kin-kwok, said it was hard to say, adding that it ""depends on the ­situation"".
A police source said they were ready for deployment.
Chan said using force would not be his officers' first resort for crowd dispersal, and that police understood the effect high-pressure cannons would have on people.
""Every trained police officer here has personally tested different pressures and different distances. We ought to be cognisant of how impactful the vehicles are,"" the senior superintendent said.
He said the cannons would only be aimed at protesters' lower limbs, in accordance with ­guidelines.
""We only target people violently charging against us, not particular individuals. We will stop using the weapons after achieving our aims,"" he said.
Before the demonstration, pan-democrat legislators protested at the scene, accusing police of using excessive force when dealing with protesters on Sunday.
A question and answer ­session was also cut short after pro-democracy legislators got into an argument with controversial pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho Kwan-yiu.
Costing a total of HK$16.59 million, the Mercedes-Benz vehicles arrived in the city in May last year. Each boasts 15 high-pressure cannons and seven cameras. Tender documents show two cannons on the roof can fire more than 1,200 litres of water a minute over a distance of 50 metres. The water can be mixed with tear gas, or liquid dye that would allow police to identify protesters after they disperse.
Human rights groups and some legislators have raised concerns over the potentially fatal weapons. A South Korean farmer was seriously injured during a protest in 2015 when a police water cannon knocked him off his feet, causing him to smash his head on the road. He later died.
In a 2015 study, local police monitoring group Civil Rights ­Observer said the water jets could deliver 145kg of force from a distance of five metres and 127kg from 10 metres.
Last week, Amnesty International warned that the use of ­armoured cars in the city's densely populated streets could cause serious injuries and further inflame tensions.
""Water cannons are not a toy for the Hong Kong police to deploy as a sign of strength ... This equipment can knock a person over, push them into fixed objects, cause permanent loss of sight, or pick up objects and propel them as missiles. In Hong Kong's crowded streets, their deployment could be a recipe for disaster,"" said Man-kei Tam, director of Amnesty in Hong Kong.
The assistant commissioner of police overseeing operations could authorise the vehicles' deployment, following a threat assessment. The guidelines also state any use should be in line with the Police General Orders governing the use of force by officers.
Peaceful protests against the extradition legislation have often descended into violent clashes with police. Officers have used tear gas, rubber bullets, beanbag rounds, sponge grenades and pepper spray to try to disperse protesters, with mixed results.
Police proposed buying the cannons in the government's ­annual budget announced in February 2015, two months after the 79-day pro-democracy Occupy protests ended."
South China Morning Post,2019-09-18,Protesters advocate fresh tactic_ settle scores personally Some activists call for physical retaliat,958 ,"
The growing use of force by anti-government protesters took a new turn over the past weekend, with vigilantism being advocated to tackle clashes with rival groups.Demonstrators have adopted a new phrase - si liu - Cantonese for""resolving things privately"".
The line advocates physical ­retaliation against aggressive groups rather than retreating or asking police - whom many ­protesters view as the enemy - to mediate and enforce the law.
Calls for physical retaliation intensified online following attacks on Saturday at Fortress Hill, when a group of men in blue T-shirts bearing the ­slogan ""I lovepolice"" were seen openly beating civilians with wooden sticks and Chinese ­national flags near aLennon Wall.
Previously, clashes in Tsuen Wan, North Point and Yuen Long had involved groups of older men attacking black-clad protesters.
From ­Saturday to yesterday, more than 140 discussion threads about fighting back were posted on LIHKG, an online forum ­frequented by protesters.
The call for fist fights comes on top of an array of tactics anti-government protesters have been deploying over the past months, each appearing more violent than before.
In the early weeks, they used metal fences and barricades to block police before turning to hurling projectiles such as eggs, bricks, bottles and iron poles, and aiming laser pointers to targetthe eyesight of officers training beanbag rounds at them.
Their actions escalated over the past few weeks as petrol bombs have become standard weapons of radical factions on the front lines.
Attacking MTR stations isnow routine, in retaliation forthe ­operator's cooperation with ­police. Last Sunday, protesters burned the entrance to Wan Chai MTR, and the Sunday before they set fire to another entrance at Central MTR station.
In digital pamphlets circulated by the protesters, they said the MTR had ""betrayed"" Hongkongers by shutting down train lines during mass protests and should be ""sanctioned"". They also cited the rail operator's refusal to ­release security camera footage of a controversial police operation inside Prince Edward station on August 31.
Now their latest tactic isphysical combat, including using ­umbrellas or poles but, protesters say, only in response to provocations and attacks by others, using poles and sticks on them.
Last Sunday, black-clad activists and others in casual wear were seen fighting anti-protesters in various locations. At least five cases were documented, including that of a man beaten by more than a dozen protesters after he ­allegedly hit someone at Fortress Hill.
Another man was beaten by a group in Wan Chai before he fainted and was sent to hospital, ­police said on Monday.
In all the incidents, protesters ­insisted they were retaliating against attacks, but these claims could not be independentlyverified.
On the forum, even as users supported retaliating against ­violent counterprotesters, others counselled restraint. They warned this tactic could undermine support for the movement.
""If someone actually dies,the thugs will have reasons to use increased force against us,"" one user wrote, adding that peacefulprotesters might distance themselves from the movement.
Other users said violence against counterprotesters was only justified if activists did not throw the first punch, noting the movement had a responsibility to keep the peace.
""If we fight people over verbal arguments, how are we different from the police and government supporters?"" one user wrote.
Baptist University political ­scientist Edmund Cheng Waisaid it was too early to judge ifvigilantism had taken root among ­protesters, but conceded the situation was worrying.
""It is a sign of a collapse of trust in public institutions,"" Cheng said, adding some might feel the police had not been impartial in their handling of the rival groups.
Cheng said it was possible protesters would reflect and change their tactics, like they did aftertwo mainlanders were held and assaulted at Hong Kong airport last month.
The scholar also suggested ­ordinary Hongkongers might ­tolerate protesters' acts of retaliation, given that they had been subjected to ""gang-style"" violence by civilians who indiscriminately beat people. ""Protesters, journalists and bystanders were subjected to this kind of violence,"" he said.
Reporters, including two Post journalists, were among those ­attacked by a group of men in North Point on Sunday.
Meanwhile, protesters interviewed by the Post blamed ­police inaction against violence from opponents as the reason for taking matters into their own hands.
The force has come under fire for turning up late - almost 40 minutes after the first report - to stop the indiscriminate attacks on protesters, journalists and passers-by at Yuen Long MTR station, as well as terrified passengers on trains on July 21.
A male protester in his 30s, who declined to be named, said he would retaliate if attacked. ""Protecting yourself has become your civic duty, there is no going back for Hong Kong,"" he said, adding this might ­deter counterprotesters from launching further attacks.
He also claimed in July, when scuffles broke out over a Lennon Wall in Yau Tong, that policeofficers ""escorted pro-government ­people away and let them go"".
A social work student, surnamed Leung, said he understood why some protesters had resorted to brawling even though such acts were ""undesirable"".
""The fact is that police officers are impotent and have been ­condoning attacks against ­protesters,"" Leung, one of the ­protesters who stormed the ­Legislative Council complex on July 1, said.
He said he drew the line at causing lives to be lost but did not set out how protesters could prevent such an outcome if things got out of hand.

South China Morning Post,2019-08-19,Police show their softer side in video clip Officer in footage tries to coax protesters to leave sta,398 ,"
The city's embattled police force has tried to show its softer side amid ­recent struggles with anti-govern­ment protesters, ­releasing a video of an officer gently persuading ­residents ­besieging a police ­station to leave.
The force released the clip, ­titled ""Affectionate dialogue in ­laser"", on its Facebook page on Saturday. It shows a white-shirted male officer addressing protesters and residents through a microphone outside Ma On Shan Police Station.
The protesters surrounded the police station for several nights starting on August 2 in support of eight people, including Hong Kong National Party convenor Andy Chan Ho-tin, who were ­arrested in Fo Tan a day before.
In the video, instead of shouting loudly and angrily like some of his peers during previous protests, the officer explains potential offences and penalties to those outside the station in great detail.
""Do you know you are ­committing the offence of unlawful assembly, which bears a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment?"" the officer says, after asking his colleagues to point lights and cameras at a certain protester accused of pointing a laser.
""I hope you can leave immediately, give yourself another chance and think about your parents who have been supporting you,"" the officer says.
Then he turns to another protester. ""Look at the chat groups on your phone, do you want to lose contact with them for five years?"" he says.
""If you have also committed criminal damage, that means another 10 years. And if you are also part of a riot, that will bring you a total of 25 years in jail. How much time does that mean to you?""
In less than one day, the video was seen 255,000 times and became the second most popular clip on the force's Facebook page.
Facebook user Alfred Lai wrote a soft approach was the only right way to ease tensions. Another commenter, Ricky Cheung, wrote persuasion was better than physical dispersal. ""It's useless to use force every time.""
But Chris Mak Yun-pui, a pro-democracy district councillor based in Ma On Shan, said the force's promotion of the clip was ""sugar-coated poison"".
""What makes me uncomfortable is that a gentle threat is essentially a threat,"" Mak said.
Policing and public order management expert Lawrence Ho Ka-ki said what mattered now was beyond policing tactics.
""The loss of mutual trust is the main reason of confrontation or even escalated violence,"" Ho said."
South China Morning Post,2019-07-10,"Singaporeans show support for HK protests, poll finds Analysts suggest results reflect close-knit ti",652 ,"
Over three-quarters of 1,000 ­Singaporeans surveyed in June said they supported Hong Kong's ongoing protests against a ­controversial extradition bill - a result political analysts suggested was a reflection of the close-knit ties between the ""twin cities"".
Still, the observers said the strong support level did not ­necessarily mean Hong Kong-style street politics would soon spring up in the strictly governed city state.
Singapore media have been covering the protests extensively, and the results of the poll - conducted by independent pollster Blackbox Research - are in sharp contrast to the reactions of commentators such as Singaporean ex-newspaper editor Leslie Fong.
In a piece for the Post, Fong said ""thoughtful Singaporeans"" were ""deeply saddened"" by events that were unfolding in Hong Kong, and in an op-ed for The Straits Times, that Singaporeans were watching ""in sadness and bewilderment"" the television footage of the July 1 storming of the Legislative Council building by protesters.
To a four-choice question on their views regarding Hongkongers' concerns about the extradition bill, a quarter of respondents said they strongly supported those concerns, while slightly over half said they somewhat ­supported them.
Four per cent said they strongly opposed the protests, and the remaining 20 per cent said they were somewhat opposed.
In another four-choice ­question, three-quarters of ­respondents said they had been following the protests either ""very closely"" (32 per cent) or ""not closely"" (42 per cent).
Twenty per cent said they heard about the story but did not follow it, while 6 per cent said they had not heard about it.
Blackbox attached the questions on the protests to a routine monthly questionnaire.
David Black, the pollster's owner and managing director, said the results put paid to ­perceptions that Singaporeans were ""bemused"" by the Hong Kong protests.
""I don't think that is the case,"" Black said.
Since early June, Hong Kong has been mired in its worst ­political crisis in decades because of the extradition bill - which would have allowed suspects to be sent to jurisdictions with which it lacks extradition agreements, including the mainland, to face trial.
Political observers offered varying reasons for the ­overwhelming support among Singaporeans for the Hong Kong protests.
With the Lion City's well-known strict stance on direct ­action - onerous rules govern ­protests outside its free speech park - City University of Hong Kong assistant professor Stephan Ortmann said he was puzzled by the poll data.
""Singaporeans are used to always having to accept what the government says and they may admire Hongkongers for being willing and daring to stand up, even to China, which is so ­powerful,"" Ortmann, who has written about the history of ­student ­activism in Hong Kong, said.
Eugene Tan, a political observer and law professor, pointed to fraternal feelings between Hong Kong and Singapore as a likely reason for Singaporeans' strong support for the protests.
""The empathy Singaporeans have for Hong Kong protesters stems primarily from the ­conviction, passion, and sense of purpose that Hongkongers have shown, especially the younger generation,"" Tan, from Singapore Management University, said.
""The Hong Kong protests, before the violent storming of the Legislative Council building, will certainly be a ­reference point for Singaporeans if they are in a similar situation.
""It is about fighting on bravely even in the face of futility.""
Bilahari Kausikan, a retired Singaporean top diplomat, ­offered a less sanguine interpretation of the poll.
Bilahari stirred controversy in June with comments on Facebook that the protesters had ""lost all sense of reality"" for going against the central government in Beijing.
In his comments to the Post, the ex-ambassador said the Blackbox poll results put on ­display ""natural human feelings"" of sympathy that Singaporeans had for Hong Kong."
South China Morning Post,2019-06-25,Transfersof patients 'standard practice' Private facility chiefs defend the referral of injured prot,407 ,"
Bosses of private hospitals have defended the transfer of injured protesters to public facilities, where they were at risk of arrest over clashes with police.
Demonstrators would receive urgent treatment if required, ­private health chiefs insisted, but they added that cases with legal implications ultimately fell within the remit of state hospitals.
Their remarks came after the privately run Tsuen Wan Adventist Hospital was accused of refusing to treat a protester injured in the anti-extradition bill protests on June 12, and referring the patient to a public hospital where the ­person was later arrested.
A notice was also foundat ­another private facility, StTeresa's Hospital in Kowloon, stating it would transfer all cases that ""require police attention or are of a criminal nature"" to public hospitals, sparking concerns over whether the right to medical care was denied at private centres.
Dr William Ho Shiu-wei, chairman of the Hong Kong Private Hospitals Association, said it was common practice among private hospitals that criminal suspects would not be provided withfurther care and instead sent to public facilities. But he said there was ""no such consensus or guidelines"" among private hospitals on whether patients involved in protests were considered suspects.
Ho explained private hospitals would provide urgent treatment to any patient but ""cases thatinvolve criminal or medico-legal implications are often transferred to public hospitals for further management after stabilisation"".
Ho said the transfers had been standard practice for years.
Tsuen Wan Adventist Hospital said medical care was provided to the patient in question on June 12.
The patient was encouraged to seek further treatment in a nearby public hospital after his condition was stabilised, it said in a statement, but the patient chose to leave on his own accord.
The hospital said the case was reported to police after officers said earlier they needed to be ­informed of any protesters presenting themselves for treatment.
But it added in yesterday's statement it would issue guidelines to its staff on the strict protection of patient confidentiality.
The Post contacted St Teresa's for a response.
Medical sector lawmaker Dr Pierre Chan said private hospitals should treat protesters as normal people. ""Hong Kong's laws and the Basic Law protects the freedom of assembly, and thus [taking part in protests] should not be seen as violating laws,"" Chan said."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-13,"MTR heads, police meet to discuss safety Rail chiefs convey concerns over controversial enforcement",607 ,"
Top brass of the MTR Corporation met senior police management yesterday to discuss if officers' ­enforcement actions at the city's railway stations had posed a ­danger to passengers or staff.
The urgent meeting came as police admitted firing tear gas ­inside Kwai Fong station on Sunday night in an unprecedented deployment and also using pepper balls at Tai Koo station, with riot police charging inside to grab protesters who had been moving from one station to another. Video footage showed officers at the top of a long moving escalator beating protesters, as smoke filled the air.
Police stepped up the use of force at MTR stations as protesters continued their new hit-and-run tactics to unleash chaos across multiple districts.
""The MTR management had a meeting with the police today and has conveyed to the police our concern over the incident, and urged them to take the safety of MTR staff and passengers into account during their law-enforcement actions,"" it said.
""The corporation also calls on everyone to be considerate and we condemn all acts of violence,"" it added.
Yesterday, two rail unions met the MTR's senior management to raise concerns over staff safety regarding the police crackdown on protesters at the two stations.
Tam Kin-chiu, vice-chairman of the pro-government Hong Kong Federation of Railway Trade Unions, which represents 4,000 MTR workers in four unions, said a lot of members felt terrified by Sunday's police action at stations and they feared for their safety.
Tam quoted Adi Lau Tin-shing, the MTR Corp's operations director: ""Lau told us that the safety of passengers and staff was their primary concern and any police measures that affect their safety would not be acceptable,"" he said.
Tam said they demanded the rail giant give clear instructions about police actions. ""The situation at the moving escalator in Tai Koo station was very dangerous. The escalators should have been immediately stopped. I suggest that in future, if there are safety concerns, we should promptly close the station,"" he said.
He also revealed that the rail operator would closely monitor the movements of crowds and their potential destinations and would inform relevant staff of advanced contingency measures.
""The staff will keep a close eye on crowd movements. For example, if protesters start to take a certain rail line to go to a destination, rail staff will immediately report to staff at that destination for contingency measures,"" he said.
Tam also acknowledged the rail firm would also notify police of crowd movements, as it considered them ""partners"".
He revealed the rail operator had promised to deploy double manpower for the affected stations on the days of protests and also stepped up protection measures for frontline staff, including the provision of protective gear for train drivers and station control staff, namely helmets and N95 face masks. ""You will see some drivers or staff wearing helmets. They are not protesters but MTR staff,"" he said.
As a lot of protesters were jumping turnstiles to catch trains, he said the company had instructed staff to refrain from confronting them out of safety concerns. ""The company ask staff not to argue with people who jump over the gates without paying. It doesn't want them to affect crowd control and just wants them to quickly disperse,"" he said.
An MTR source said that every day at closing time at Admiralty station in recent months, there had been thousands of dollars in coins and notes left by people for protesters to buy tickets. Many protesters have been reluctant to pay using non-contact Octopus cards for fear of leaving an electronic trail of their movements."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-31,Campus test of loyalties Some mainland students say joining anti-government protests finally made th,1332 ,"
The moment mainland student Susan Li stepped into the sea of protesters, chanting sloganslike everyone else, she wasoverwhelmed.
""It was the first time I felt I had integrated into the city. In the past, I did not consider Hong Kong my home,"" says the 20-year-old University of Hong Kongstudent, who was attending the first protest in her life.
That was on June 9, when organisers said more than a million people took to the streets against the now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be transferred to the mainland, among other places.
""For the first time, I felt that even though I was from the mainland, I was with you, the people of Hong Kong,"" says Li, who has been in the city for three years.
""No matter where we were from, we all wanted the government to withdraw the bill. We were all equal.""
She and other mainlanders interviewed asked not to be identified by their real names, fearing their families might be harassed by the authorities. Only a handful of mainland students have taken part in the protests, they say.
There are also mainland students opposed to the protests, but there have been only sporadic scuffles between them and locals on the city's campuses, unlike in Australia where more violent clashes have taken place.
In July, a mainland alumnus of City University was arrested for tearing down anti-extradition bill posters and memos from the""democracy wall"" on campus.He also pushed a Goddess ofDemocracy statue to the floor.
The same month, local students were angered when several of their mainland peers at HKU tore down posters critical of remarks by vice chancellor Zhang Xiang on the protests.
In a meeting between Zhang andstudents, one from the mainland said the campus had become too politicised, suggesting there should be more stringent policies about putting up posters.
Mainland students interviewed say they have not behaved like nationalistic Chinese people overseas, partly because being in Hong Kong they understand that the protests are not about fighting for independence, as has been portrayed in media across the border. Others say they have felt mostly indifferent to the protests, because they are outsiders.
All eyes will be on campuses next week, and whether there will be clashes when mainland students return for the new school year. Another question is whether mainland and foreign students remain keen to study in Hong Kong, given the continuing protests and escalating violence.
For Li, attending the June 9 protest was a surreal experience because demonstrations are banned on the mainland. She also joined the June 16 protest, which drew an estimated 2 million.
Then she began to feel fearful. She became worried that when she returned to the mainland, immigration officers would check her mobile phone, go through her photos and see that she had joined the protests. That has happened to some friends, she says.
Li stopped attending protests.
""I haven't told anyone about my participation, not even my parents or my friends,"" she says.
Li says some mainland students are not willing to understand what is happening as they feel they are outsiders. Some rely on microblogging site Weibo for news, not the city's media outlets. ""It is a laughable platform. You can't find anything nourishing there,"" she says.
As for students on the mainland, Li says they only have access to government-controlled media and so do not have a clear grasp of what the protests are about.
""I was on the mainland when Occupy Central happened,"" she says, referring to the 2014 pro-democracy protests that shut down several parts of the city for 79 days. ""I thought it was about Hong Kong independence.""
In June, a Baptist University graduate from the mainland, Zhao Haoyang, 28, wrote an article headlined ""Can Hong Kong be saved?"", in which he said youngsters who took part in protests were not bad, merely stupid.
""If you don't like this simple word 'stupid', you can use'childish',"" he wrote in the article, which went viral online.
He said Hongkongers had for a long time been influenced by Western values and ordinarypeople were easily fooled, having a sense of ""hypocritical satisfaction"" when they took part in aprotest, feeling they had done something righteous.
Mainlander Grace Chen, 23, who graduated from HKU a year ago, has taken part in manyprotests since June. Once she walked more than an hour from her home to the protest site because she feared that taking the MTR would leave an electronic trail showing her participation.
She says ""extremely few"" mainland students have taken part in the protests.
""Some of them think about the protests the same way mainlanders do, that the protesters are just looking for trouble,"" Chen says.
Her own friends across the border are adamant that foreign countries must be behind theprotests, a claim repeatedly made in the mainland media.
She believes the mainland ­students involved in clashes in Australia and Canada have done so because Chinese people ­usually have a stronger sense of national identity when they are overseas.
But she adds: ""I look downon the Chinese students who,despite given the choice [of the open internet] while abroad, still choose to read only the censored mainland media.""
The Post asked Hong Kong's eight publicly funded universities if any mainland and foreignstudents have decided against studying in the city because of the protests. City University wasthe only one to say there hadalready been an impact.
""The university has received notifications from universities in Singapore stating that Singapore's Ministry of Education has advised citizens to defer non-essential travel to Hong Kong,"" a spokesman says.
""Some exchange students and non-local students from Singapore and other places have also informed us they will not be coming to study in Hong Kong even after they have paid the deposits.""
A HKU spokesman says about 700 foreign and mainland ­students have been admitted to its undergraduate programmes this year, with about half from across the border. The figure is similar to previous years.
Chinese University says no student has withdrawn orsuspended their studies due to the social unrest. A spokesman says the university has been in close contact with non-local student bodies to understand their needs and concerns and provide them with any support needed.
Lingnan University says it has received ""a few"" applications from non-locals to suspend their studies. But a spokesman says he cannot tell if these are related to the ""recent social atmosphere"".
Education University says its intake of non-local students this year is similar to that of previous years, while Polytechnic University says it has not seen any significant impact from the protests.
The University of Science and Technology says every year there are students who do not turn up for various reasons, including that they have multiple admissionoffers. Baptist University did not respond.
Brian Liu, 20, a mainland ­student at Baptist who describes himself as patriotic, says he ­respects Hongkongers' right to protest, but only if they do not call for independence. He has not joined any protest, partly because he fears for his safety, given the ­escalating violence. ""I am not a Hongkonger,"" he says. ""I don't have the impulse to take part.""
Dr Edmund Cheng Wai, a political scientist at Baptist ­University, says there could be sporadic scuffles between local and mainland students when a planned general student strike takes place on Monday.
""The atmosphere on campuses could become tense.Obviously, different people have different views on this,"" Cheng says. ""Mainland students may not resent the protests ... but it will be a totally different matter when it comes to national sovereignty.""
Labour Party lawmaker Dr Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung, a retired social science academic at Polytechnic University, is worried about potential conflict.
""University campuses are places where students shouldengage in discussions. I hope everyone will have an open mind to discuss and not fight,"" he says."
South China Morning Post,2019-09-10,MTR stations 'may not survive more attacks' Rail union warns staff are unable to keep up with repair,900 ,"
Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor met transport operators yesterday to discuss ­escalating vandalism by anti-government protesters, even as the city's railway operator warned that some stations had been so ­frequently damaged by ­rampaging mobs that they might not be able to survive further damage.
A day after radicals wreaked havoc at Central MTR station, trashing the facilities and setting one entrance ablaze, senior ­officials from the rail company gave Lam and transport chief Frank Chan Fan a first-hand look at the damage and repair work.
With more than 40 per cent of the city's 91 train stations ­damaged, the union representing MTR Corporation employees said they could not keep up with repair work at the rate protesters were causing destruction.
Hong Kong Federation of Railway Trade Unions vice-chairman Tam Kin-chiu appealed for an end to violent protests and chaos at MTR stations.
""Our colleagues are exhausted and very discouraged as we are in a cycle of damage, repair and damage again,"" he said. ""We ­restore the impaired facilities with components we take from equipment in unharmed stations, but we will soon run out of parts.
""However, for some stations like Prince Edward, Mong Kok and Yau Ma Tei, which protesters have repeatedly vandalised every time we've repaired them, we are not sure if they will survive ­another round of massive ­damage.""
Transport minister Chan and the top three MTR officials - ­chairman Rex Auyeung Pak-kuen, CEO Jacob Kam Chak-pui and ­operations director Adi Lau Tin-shing - also inspected Wan Chai station, which was trashed during Sunday's violent protests.
""We came to take a look at the facilities and to raise the morale of MTR staff, who worked overnight to restore facilities and services,"" Chan said, as passers-by shouted obscenities and slogans at them.
""Protesters should respect commuters' rights,"" he added.
Auyeung, appearing in public for the first time since the MTR became a regular target of protesters, appealed to demonstrators to respect the metro system, which is used daily by 5.4 million people.
""The rail system is the pride of Hong Kong, which we should treasure,"" he said.
The city's embattled leader also discussed measures being taken to deal with protest violence and disruptions with Commissioner of Police Stephen Lo Wai-chung, MTR officials, Airport Authority chairman Jack So Chak-kwong and the authority's CEO, Fred Lam Tin-fuk.
Central, Wan Chai, Mong Kok and Prince Edward stations had to be shut down on Sunday after ­violent mobs attacked them following a peaceful mass rally.
Rod-wielding radicals broke glass windows inside and outside the stations and vandalised ticketing machines.
At Central station, some started a large fire at a ground-level ­entrance near the Mandarin Oriental luxury hotel.
At Wan Chai station yesterday, damaged turnstile displays caused confusion at times for ­passengers who could not see the cost of their journeys deducted from their stored-value Octopus cards. All gates were functional, ­although an add-value machine and some television screens were still out of order at noon.
Police announced yesterday that they had arrested 157 people - aged between 14 and 63 - over the weekend for offences including station vandalism.
They also revealed that they had finally obtained the medical records of a young woman who suffered a severe eye injury during a violent protest last month, ­despite her attempts to block the move.
Protesters have been venting their rage on the MTR after the railway operator started calling police to remove them from its premises during rowdy and ­violent demonstrations, and ­closing stations in advance to avoid chaos and vandalism.
The operator started taking ­action after it was accused by mainland state media of not only allowing protesters to use stations as staging points to attack police but also providing them with free rides to escape.
Rampaging groups armed with metal rods have smashed CCTV cameras, Octopus card readers, ticketing machines, glass doors, turnstiles and station ­control rooms. They have ­frequently grabbed fire extinguishers and set them off in the premises when confronting ­police or fighting with other ­commuters.
Tam said thousands of MTR staff had been mobilised to repair ruined facilities overnight, but many were battered beyond ­repair. Routine and scheduled maintenance works were being put on hold to deal with immediate repairs to keep station operations running.
He said facilities of the MTR's light rail system serving Yuen Long, Tin Shui Wai and Tuen Mun were also badly damaged. More than half of the 68 stations had ­Octopus card readers destroyed and top-up machines smashed.
""We have complaints from students who were late for school in the past week as a result of ­insufficient Octopus card readers at light rail stations,"" he said.
The official state news agency, Xinhua, condemned the weekend violence at MTR stations.
""Astonishingly, there are still people in Hong Kong society who are exceptionally tolerant towards violence and refuse to cut ties with the violent protesters,"" it said.
""In reality, this kind of mentality has fuelled the aggressiveness of those mobs, and given them a false feeling that the whole of society will support or accept their so-called 'resistance' and continue to live in a self-beautifying illusion.""

South China Morning Post,2019-07-29,"fire and fury in city's heart Protesters again defy ban, marching in two directions before clashing",691 ,"
Hong Kong's young protesters have changed tactics - and even targets - as they turned a rally in Central into a 6km march, setting fires and clashing with authorities all the way from Sai Wan to ­Causeway Bay.
Tens of thousands of protesters yesterday defied a police ban for the second consecutive day and occupied major thoroughfares on Hong Kong Island. A day earlier, an estimated 280,000 people joined a march in Yuen Long that ended in violence, tear gas and more chaos.
The police had earlier turned down a request to hold a march from Central to Sun Yat Sen ­Memorial Park in Sai Ying Pun over fears of violence. Instead, the authorities allowed protesters to hold a rally at Chater Garden in Central.
Soon after the rally started at 3pm, however, the crowd of ­thousands left the authorised zone, spilled out onto Chater Road and advanced towards ­Admiralty along Queensway with no clear destination.
Some protest leaders suggested advancing to North Point, but the marchers decided - at about 4.30pm - to stop at Causeway Bay, where they erected ­barricades by dismantling metal railings.
Around the same time, a group of protesters in the middle of the march decided to head west toSai Ying Pun to rally at Beijing's ­liaison office in the city.
The liaison office was attacked a week earlier by protesters who pelted the building with eggs and paintballs and defaced China's national emblem.
This time the liaison officewas ready: hours earlier, staff had protected the newly replaced ­national emblem with a plastic screen.
Several protesters told the Post that the new tactic of splitting the main body of protesters into ­different groups was a way to drain the energy and resources of the police.
""In the past, we have always concentrated on one destination, but it's almost like guerilla tactics this time,"" said 28-year-old Willie Wong.
Chloe Chan, 22, who marched towards Admiralty with two friends, said police were to blame for the paralysed roads.
""It was the police who forced us to go in different directions ­because they had not approved a specific route for the march in the first place,"" she said.
The freestyle march also ­appeared to give protesters choices about how they wanted to participate.
In Central, a protester held up a placard with three options: head towards Causeway Bay, where police officers were clearing the roads; Sai Ying Pun, where there was a heavy police presence; or Chater Garden, where they would be free from legal consequences because it was a lawful rally.
At one location, a 450-metre human chain was formed by ­protesters to pass helmets, ­umbrellas, cling wrap and other items. Some protesters served as runners to take urgently needed supplies to the front line.
At around 6pm, organisers urged protesters to stop passing supplies to the east and called on them to shift the resources to Sai Ying Pun, where a stand-off was under way with riot police some 200 metres from the liaison office.
""Our main purpose today is to demand that police explain the 36 shots they fired in Sheung Wanon July 21. There's no use goingto Causeway Bay,"" said Colour Chan, 24, who was worried about police operations in Sai Wan.""We need more people there to protect our protesters.""
A 26-year-old, who gave her surname as Yeung, said numbers mattered for the guerilla strategy to work. ""If there are enough ­people, it might be a good idea to distract the police by splitting into groups. But if there's not enough people, it's better for us to stay ­together,"" she said.
Some protesters bought stacks of single-trip tickets and handed them out at Causeway Bay MTR station to those who were heading to Sai Ying Pun. Another team of protesters provided single-trip tickets at Sheung Wan station for those headed back to the New Territories. Demonstrators have been using single-trip tickets ­instead of their Octopus cards on protest days to avoid being tracked by police.
The most frequent chant in the crowd yesterday was ""Liberate Hong Kong: the revolution of our times"". The slogan was the ­election campaign tagline of Edward Leung Tin-Kei, a pro-independence activist who was jailed for his role in the 2016 Mong Kok riot."
South China Morning Post,2019-06-24,Police 'harassed' hospital staff,410 ,"
A group of medical and legal professionals yesterday accused police of harassing hospital staff and arresting anti-extradition bill protesters seeking treatment, saying at least five demonstrators were detained while seeking help.
Accusing the force of spreading ""white terror"", the group also said there were injured demonstrators who declined to be taken to hospital because they feared arrest.
""Our message to police is that they must behave themselves, and review what they did in the hospitals,"" said Dr Wong Yam-hong, spokesman for doctors' concern group Médecins Inspirés.
""We consider this white terror because there were injured protesters who did not want to seek help at the hospitals.""
Wong was one of a group of about 80 medical and legal practitioners, together with six professional bodies, who signed a petition calling on the force to stop its actions in hospitals. The group said it knew of three protesters who were arrested at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, one at Kwong Wah Hospital and one at Yan Chai Hospital. Four were held on suspicion of rioting and one for illegal assembly.
The group accused officers of walking around public hospitals' accident and emergency departments to look for protesters. Some eavesdropped on conversations among staff, while others asked workers to give them the personal information of protesters being treated, it said.
The actual number of hospital arrests was expected to be higher than five, some group members said.
Earlier this month, police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds during clashes at the legislature where a crowd had gathered to try to put a stop to the government's now-suspended extradition bill.
""Police are not the law. They can't just walk around a hospital and ask staff for [protesters' information],"" Wong said.
Lau Hoi-man, spokesman of the Hong Kong Allied Health Professionals and Nurses Association, said a plain-clothes officer scolded a nurse at Queen Elizabeth Hospital while walking around the A&E department looking for protesters. The nurse eventually called hospital security staff to get the officer out, he said.
Barrister Chris Ng Chung-luen, from the Progressive Lawyers' Group, said if it could be proven that police gathered evidence at the hospital in an illegal way, its admissibility in court could be challenged.
The Hospital Authority yesterday said it only knew of three police arrests in public hospitals. The Post has contacted police for comment.

South China Morning Post,2019-11-21,Convicted activists offered US visa lifeline Bill would also increase scrutiny of Hong Kong governme,463 ,"
Pro-democracy activists have cheered progress of the US bill ­targeting Hong Kong, saying it will help students convicted of ­involvement in the protests to get study visas, while placing government officials under scrutiny.
They hope the Hong Kong ­Human Rights and Democracy Act wikk be signed into law soon by President Donald Trump.
Jason Y. Ng, a US lawyer and convenor of the Progressive ­Lawyers Group, which advocates the rule of law, said the bill ­stipulated that visa applicants who had been arrested or ­convicted for their roles in protests would not be denied a visa for the United States, contrary to the existing arrangement.
It would also place Hong Kong government officials, police officers and their family members under scrutiny and deter them from acting with impunity.
""Before an officer beats up ­another protester or an inspector offers another tenuous defence for excessive force at the police force's daily press conference, they need to think twice because there may be comeuppance for them or their families if they ever want to set foot on US soil or buy a property or open a bank account in the US,"" he said.
The pro-establishment Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong condemned the new law, saying what Hong Kong was facing was not a human rights and democracy issue, accusing American lawmakers of ""turning black into white"".
US lawmakers regard the bill as crucial in holding mainland and Hong Kong government officials responsible for what they perceive as the city's eroding autonomy as well as human rights violations.
The bill also calls for sanctions against any individuals or entities deemed to have violated freedoms guaranteed under Hong Kong's Basic Law, the city's ­mini-constitution.
It will have implications on the special treatment Hong Kong has enjoyed with the US since its handover from Britain to the mainland in 1997, in areas such as trade, visa applications, imports of technology and cultural ­exchanges.
""We want the bill to pass as soon as possible,"" said Joshua Wong Chi-fung, co-founder of the 2014 Occupy movement, who is facing trial over an unlawful ­assembly and was jailed in 2017 for his role in mass protests.
""It partly means the US consulate will consider granting visas to students who are convicted [for their role] in protests. We have seen the police indiscriminately arrest protesters,"" he said.
Students have played a big part in the protests, which started in June and have escalated into street violence and the occupation of university campuses.
""In terms of human rights and freedom, the bill provides another layer of protection and engagement,"" legal sector lawmaker Dennis Kwok said.
""Students should be given a way out as well as options, even if they are convicted in Hong Kong due to the protests."""
South China Morning Post,2019-07-25,Yuen Long protest 'unlikely' to be given green light Yuen Long protest 'unlikely' to be given green,788 ,"
Police are unlikely to allow an anti-government protest in ­tension-filled Yuen Long on ­Saturday, according to a law ­enforcement source, with local community leaders worried about a serious risk of violence.
""In light of the bloody clashes on Sunday night and especially over the past few weeks, we attach great importance to public safety while considering whether to ­approve a protest in Yuen Long,"" one police insider said.
""But we are likely to reject the application for a letter of no objection for Saturday's rally. Ifwe indeed come to such a conclusion, the organiser can still appeal against the decision.""
Yuen Long has become a flash point after a mob of men in white T-shirts, some of whom were ­suspected to be triad gangsters, went on a rampage at the MTR station on Sunday, attacking ­protesters and passengers alike and leaving 45 injured. Police ­arrested another suspect yesterday, taking the total to 12.
Protest organiser and Yuen Long resident Chung Kin-ping said his meeting with police ­yesterday for a letter of no objection had ended in disagreement, but vowed to push ahead with the short march from near the police station to the MTR.
""What happened in Yuen Long on July 21 was a terrorist attack and it has aroused widespread concerns,"" Chung said. ""I hope people can stand up and come out to free ourselves from fear.""
He said he advocated a ""peaceful, rational and non-violent"" protest, but could not give a guarantee. ""We can't ­control what different people will do afterwards. To be honest, I'm worried,"" he said.
In a letter circulated online, Yuen Long district councillor Ching Chan-ming, who also chairs the Shap Pat HeungRural Committee, told the ­district's police commander that his group would strongly object if the march were allowed to go ahead.
""It's already been widely circulated on the internet that some people will attack Nam Pin Wai village that night ... If police still issue a letter of no objection, they need to be held responsible for all serious consequences,"" the letter read. He was referring to calls ­online for protesters to target the village where some of the attackers were said to be from andto damage their ancestral halls as revenge.
Ching also accused the organiser of being a pro-independence activist, which Chung denied.
Leading developer Sun Hung Kai Properties was planning to step up safety measures in its malls near the railway station this weekend, while 13 members of the Yuen Long District Council issued a joint statement calling on villagers and protesters to exercise self-restraint.
""The district council members are extremely worried about an outbreak of violence this Saturday,"" chairman Shum Ho-kit said.
Anger over the Yuen Long rampage was directed at the city's rail operator yesterday, with a handful of protesters causing rush-hour chaos by stopping a train from leaving Admiralty station. That had a knock-on impact on North Point station, bringing services to a halt at the interchange for the Tseung Kwan O and Island lines.
While condemning police for arriving far too late to protect the victims of the Yuen Long attacks, protesters were demanding the MTR take responsibility for their safety as well. A similar protest was in the pipeline for this morning at Kowloon Tong station.
The civil unrest over the past weeks prompted the United States, Britain, Japan and South Korea to issue travel advice to their nationals about being careful in Hong Kong, while Ireland urged a ""high degree of caution"" for its citizens.
Pro-democracy group and major anti-government rally ­organiser the Civil Human Rights Front is also urging foreign ­consulates to issue travel warnings for the city in light of the Yuen Long rampage.
Asked about Ireland's move, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in Beijing that Hongkongers would be saddened by it. ""All people ... who really love Hong Kong should unite to safeguard the city's security and ­order. Let Hong Kong, the Pearl of the Orient, shine once again,"" she said.
More anti-government protests are expected, including two marches ending at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Park in Western district this coming Sunday and the next.
The park is about 1km from Beijing's liaison office, which was besieged on July 21 by protesters who defaced the national emblem at the front of the building.
For the first time in the protest crisis, the head of all the city's ­disciplinary services, including immigration, customs and fire ­departments, issued a joint statement strongly condemning the recent outbreaks of violence.
""The disciplinary forces will stay united to keep up their commitment, continue to do their utmost in upholding the rule of law and give unswerving support to the chief executive,"" they said."
South China Morning Post,2019-10-24,Firms hit by protests look to cut operations amid gloom Fulum eyes property sales while Best Mart 36,677 ,"
Companies that have been ­frequently targeted and vandalised in the increasingly violent anti-government protests since June because of links to the ­mainland or their owners ­supporting Beijing are looking to shrink their operations amid a gloomy retail environment.
Restaurant operator Fulum Group Holdings has put eight properties worth some HK$2.57 billion on sale. Snack food chain Best Mart 360 and Genki Sushi, whose Hong Kong operations are run by Maxim's Group, are ­considering whether to renew leases of some of their outlets.
Fulum, which protesters ­believe is linked to a Fujian clan, did not comment on whether the sales were linked to the recent vandalising of its restaurants, but said it was strategically adjusting its brand structure and reducing the size and number of some ­larger restaurants to improve ­operational efficiency.
The company is seeking HK$150 million for an 18,664 sq ft property in Sha Tin Fun City, ­occupied by its Chinese ­restaurant, Fulum Fisherman's Wharf, as part of the revamp.
Fulum Centre, a seven-storey industrial building with 36,131 sq ft of space in Kwai Chung, is also on sale for HK$290 million.
Three shops in ­Kimberley House, partly ­occupied by ­its ­MeokBang Korean BBQ & Bar ­restaurant, are being offered for HK$400 million.
Best Mart 360, which has ­repeatedly issued statements denying any connection with gangs or triads, is debating ­whether to renew leases of shops on Sheung Wan's Wing Lok Street, Aberdeen's Wu Nam Street and Causeway Bay's Jardine's Bazaar. It has already closed outlets on Causeway Bay's Hennessy Road and Nathan Road in Jordan.
""Lease renewals for shops on Wing Lok Street, Wu Nam Street and Jardine's Bazaar are being discussed, so it is normal for the owners to offer them [to others] for lease,"" a Best Mart 360 spokeswoman said. ""Normally, it is ­possible for the owner to offer the shop for lease when discussing lease renewals. It all comes down to the price.""
A total of 59 Best Mart 360 shops have been vandalised in the continuing protests and the ­company was discussing compensation with its insurer, it said in a statement to the stock exchange last week, adding it might have to bear losses if the insurer declined to cover the entire cost of the damages.
Meanwhile, two shops ­occupied by Genki Sushi in Yuen Long's Sai Ching Street were being offered for lease by the ­owner. A worker at the sushi chain said they were still operating as usual and she was unaware of any plan to cease operations.
Protesters targeted restaurants owned by Maxim's after its founder's daughter, Annie Wu Suk-ching, called protesters ­""rioters"" and said they did not ­represent Hong Kong.
Genki Sushi did not respond to ­requests for comment.
Edwin Lee, founder and chief executive of Bridgeway Prime Shop Fund Management, said owners putting their properties on sale were in no rush to sell, hinting at Fulum.
""They are testing the market and are not really in need of cash. But I think at this price range, it will be very difficult to find buyers now,"" he said, adding anyone who was interested might have to wait for the protests to end.
Lee said companies frequently targeted by ­protesters could ­encounter difficulty in renting new shops as owners were ­concerned insurers might reject their policies.
""When [potential tenants] come to rent [my shops] for a ­Starbucks or a Best Mart 360 or ­Chinese telecoms [companies], I will avoid that,"" Lee said. ""The shop may be burned.""
He said insurers could reject their applications to buy ­policies if the companies were repeatedly targeted by arsonists during the protests.
""[Insurance companies] may not even insure us,"" Lee added.
Separately, Simon Smith, ­senior director of research and consultancy at Savills, said street-level shops in areas where ­protests were most common had seen a rising number of vacant properties followed by shopping centres.
He said that despite rent ­concessions and additional rent-free ­periods offered by some ­landlords, prospective tenants had been backing off owing to the difficult business environment."
South China Morning Post,2019-10-22,Why radical protesters widened their target The increasingly violent unrest that has gripped Hong Ko,1703 ,"
When Chen, a banker from the mainland, left his home on Hong Kong Island with his family for dinner earlier this month, he was alarmed to come across a makeshift roadblock in Wong Chuk Hang near Aberdeen.
A few men in black and armed with sticks were stopping motorists and demanding they show them their mobile phones.
Spooked by an attack on ­another Mandarin-speaking banker in the city that day, Chen feared that what was on his phone could endanger his family.
""I use WeChat to communicate with my mainland clients,"" Chen said, refusing to identify himself by his full name. ""If they read my messages they would know that I'm a mainlander.""
He showed them the phone but that night the men at the roadblock were not targeting mainland Chinese - they were looking for police officers they accuse of using excessive force on duty.
Nevertheless, the encounter rattled Chen. In the four months since demonstrations erupted in Hong Kong, tensions between mainlanders and some protesters have grown, with some observers saying that part of the movement has evolved into a radical nativist crusade.
""[These protests in Hong Kong] have gone too far and strayed from their original purpose,"" he said. ""Such intimidation is illegal and unacceptable.""
The protests - triggered by an extradition bill, since withdrawn, that would have allowed suspects from Hong Kong to be sent to the mainland - have brought the city to the edge, with police officers hitting back at demonstrators with tear gas, pepper spray, batons and sometimes live rounds.
More than 2,000 protesters - one-third younger than 18 - have been arrested, but still there is little sign that the turmoil that is now into its 20th week will end any time soon.
Since September, protesters have increasingly targeted businesses suspected of having ties with the mainland, as well as those with pro-Beijing owners.
Over the weekend, radicals in Kowloon destroyed a Xiaomi smartphone outlet, a Tong Ren Tang Chinese medicine store and a Chung Hwa Bookstore branch, owned by a subsidiary of the central government's liaison office.
Earlier, protesters attacked outlets of state-owned banks such as Bank of China; smartphone maker Huawei; Starbucks and any other chains operated by food and beverage giant Maxim's; and the snack chain Best Mart 360, whose owners are suspected to have links with pro-China Fujian gangs.
They have also attacked non-mainland operations, including the MTR Corporation, which has been accused by some protesters of siding with police. The railway operator has repeatedly rejected the accusation.
A 17-year old protester, surnamed Ho, said he was not out to fight for Hong Kong independence. ""I was born after 1997 and I have not seen the freedoms Hongkongers enjoyed before the handover,"" he said.
""I just want to retrieve the 'high degree of autonomy', the principle of 'Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong' and the basic core values that are promised in the Sino-British Joint Declaration.""
A Form Six student, who asked not to be named, said she believed Hong Kong could only achieve real democracy when it became independent, but she understood it would be too difficult to achieve. ""I am not really calling for independence when I chant the slogan 'Liberate Hong Kong; Revolution of our times'. I think we are fighting for a reform in our thinking. Hongkongers are no longer apolitical - they have become defiant and are yearning for freedom,"" she said.
In August, ProgressUST, a Facebook page associated with students and graduates of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, carried a post calling for the repatriation of all mainlanders from the city, business licences of mainland companies and enterprises to be revoked, and the construction of a physical wall separating Hong Kong and the mainland. The post has since been deleted.
It is difficult to determine if such radical ideas were truly ­representative of the protesters' demands. A survey by the Hong Kong Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies at Chinese University last month showed 35.1 per cent of interviewees disagreed with the idea that radical action was the only way to pressure the government to respond to people's demands, compared with 26.9 per cent who agreed with it.
Notably, the survey also found that a significant 36.1 per cent indicated they were ""in between"" the two options.
The violence and confrontation is a sharp contrast with the peaceful mass rallies in June and July when more than a million protesters took to the streets to ­demand the bill's withdrawal. Despite the large numbers, the rallies were so orderly that the demonstrators even cleaned up their rubbish before they left.
Ren Yi, an influential mainland commentator, said the protests had become a movement about Hong Kong identity, which was different from being Chinese.
""The protests in Hong Kong have evolved to a stage that it is no longer a pro-democracy movement. Instead, it has become a radical nativist movement, which the protesters, united by the populist Hong Kong identity, want to drive anything with links to China out,"" he said.
Ren, who has a wide following among mainland officials, said the protesters had lost their moral principles in fighting for democracy when they resorted to ­violence.
""[This movement] has ­become a quasi-military force driven by violent and masked black-clad mobs who are not fighting for human rights or freedom,"" he said.
""How could the trashing of privately owned businesses, mainland banks and offices of politicians who support Beijing happen in a democratic society?
""How could the doxxing of people who have expressed support for the Hong Kong government happen in a civilised society that values freedom of speech?""
Jonathan Hassid, an assistant professor in political science at Iowa State University, said that the fact some protesters were prioritising local interests over those of others, including Beijing's, was common to protests globally.
Hassid said it was no coincidence that an ""anti-China"" sentiment had taken hold.
""I think it's the result of a number of things. First, high property prices, which many locals blame on mainland Chinese; second, an increase in mainland tourists [to the city] who are often seen to be acting badly in public,"" he said.
""And third, a sense that Hong Kong's freedoms are slowly disappearing,"" he said, referring to the disappearance of five Causeway Bay booksellers in 2015.
""This is a prominent example of the slow erosion of Hong Kong's political autonomy and special status.""
Hassid said that for many people in the city there was a sense of ""it's now or never, and if we don't act now, Hong Kong is finished"".
""This attitude naturally translates into suspicion or even bullying against mainlanders, who are seen - fairly or not - to represent Beijing's interests, not Hong Kong's.""
Tian Feilong, an associate professor at Beihang University's law school in Beijing and a specialist on Beijing's policies on Hong Kong, said people who spoke Mandarin, including tourists, journalists and new immigrants, were now potential targets of abuse stemming from ""rampant nativist sentiment"".
""It's no longer a pro-democracy movement, but more like a Hong Kong version of the Boxer rebellion,"" Tian said, referring to a movement in the late Qing dynasty to drive foreigners out of China.
Earlier this month, during a ­dialogue session with students and alumni hosted by Chinese University vice chancellor Rocky Tuan Sung-chi, a Mandarin speaker was shouted down and told she had no place in Hong Kong when she voiced disapproval of the protests.
""I want to say to the local students here that democracy and freedom are built on the foundation of law and order,"" the speaker said. ""And I also hope that local students could respect students from other regions.""
A mainland business student from the university was also harassed by local students when she put a Chinese national flag outside her dormitory room on China's National Day.
Ren, the mainland commentator, said it was a ""joke for the mobs to talk about democracy if freedom of speech cannot be protected and people can silence ­others by resorting to violence"".
He also said the protests in Hong Kong were part of a populism movement around the globe.
""Brexit and [Donald] Trump's win in the 2016 US presidential election were all driven by rising populist sentiment. People have lost faith in the elites and governments who they say no longer ­represent the public's interests. Besides the US and Britain, right-wing political parties are gaining popularity in countries like France, Italy and Hungary,"" he said.
But Sonny Lo Shiu-hing, a veteran Hong Kong-based political commentator, said populism in the city had two strands: one emphasising peaceful protest and the other advocating radical and violent means. There were also people in between with mixed intentions and orientations, he said.
Lo added that a major problem for Hong Kong now was that the protesters had not just expressed outrage against mainland interests but also the police - the city's main law enforcer.
Hassid, from Iowa State University, said both protesters and authorities had hardened their positions and it was difficult to see how the situation would end.
""It seems that the Hong Kong government - with Beijing's support - cannot back down without losing all of its remaining legitimacy. Even the resignation of [Chief Executive] Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor will no longer be enough to appease the protesters,"" he said.
""The protesters, by contrast, will not accept anything besides a total victory. Any overreaction by the police or a misstep by the government will just make the protesters even more determined.
""I don't see how either side can get what they want, and compromise looks increasingly unlikely.""
Lo was also pessimistic about a swift end to the unrest.
""Unless the government agrees to set up an independent committee to deal with citizens' complaints about police, and about police actions, I am afraid that the confrontations between radical violent populists and ­police would likely continue,"" he said. ""I am afraid that the current situation - with both peaceful and democratic protests and radical and violent populist struggles - will continue for a relatively long time."""
South China Morning Post,2019-07-29,beijing to respond to chaos Beijing to respond as another rally ends in chaos Hong Kong and Macau _A,885 ,"
China's top Hong Kong policy ­office will today respond for the first time to escalating civil unrest that has beset the city's government since June.
The announcement came as anti-government protesters clashed with riot police near the central government's liaison ­office for a second consecutive weekend.
The Hong Kong and Macau ­Affairs Office (HKMAO) under the State Council, China's cabinet, will hold a press conference in Beijing to give ""its stance and views on Hong Kong's current situation"", according to a central government notice.
It will be the first time the HKMAO has held a press briefing on the city since Britain returned it to China in 1997. It also suggests the Beijing leadership may have reached a decision on Hong Kong since a wave of mass protests and violent clashes over the now-shelved extradition bill ­began nearly two months ago.
The proposed legislation would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions including the mainland, where critics say there is no guarantee of a fair trial.
Beijing strongly condemned protesters who defaced the national emblem and spray-painted anti-Chinese slogans on the liaison office building in Sai Ying Pun a week earlier, and public sentiment on the mainland towards Hong Kong has become noticeably more negative since.
The liaison office also stepped up security and installed a protective plastic screen in front of the emblem on its front door.
The clash yesterday near the liaison office - symbol of Beijing's presence in the city - was more muted than last weekend, with riot police putting up a line of defence about 200 metres from the building and stopping protesters from marching towards it.
As night fell, officers again unfurled black warning banners that they would use force, firing tear gas at protesters just before 7pm in an attempt to disperse them. The protesters held their line behind a wall of umbrellas and threw projectiles at the officers.
Gradually, riot police gained ground and pushed protesters further away from the liaison ­office. For hours, the two sides clashed along Connaught Road and Des Voeux Road - the main thoroughfares in the central and western area of Hong Kong Island.
Protesters threw bricks, paint bombs and bottles at police and one of them was seen carrying a bow and arrow. Police responded with tear gas and beanbag rounds.
Some protesters set fire to a trolley loaded with cardboard and shoved it at officers. Other small fires broke out in various parts of the city during the night.
Police subdued and arrested at least a dozen protesters. By 10pm, four people were reported injured. As midnight approached, the protesters dispersed, filling Sheung Wan MTR station.
The demonstrators had defied a police ban to march to the liaison office, one of several protests that sprang from a rally at Chater Garden in Central. Spontaneous protests broke out alongmain roads on Hong KongIsland, stretching more than6km through Central and Causeway Bay.
Police approved the Chater Garden rally earlier this week but rejected an application for the march to Sai Ying Pun. Tens of thousands of people ignored the ban and splintered off in different directions soon after the rally in Central began at about 3pm.
The clashes followed another violent, illegal protest in Yuen Long on Saturday. Police have arrested 14 people for their parts in that protest, including organiser Max Chung Kin-ping.
""He [Chung] insisted on going to Yuen Long ... which ended in a series of violent acts. Police will never condone this behaviour,"" a police spokeswoman said, adding that officers had confiscated weapons including imitation firearms and metal rods.
The warning had little effect on those at Chater Garden yesterday, many of whom had also joined the previous day's demonstration.
""I don't think people will have protest fatigue, even though many of them marched for the whole day yesterday. I, for one, am in for the long haul,"" said Ho Yi-lik, a Yuen Long resident who was at both rallies.
Traffic was brought to a standstill, with dozens of bus services diverted and many shops closed.
Top officials including Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng ­Yuet-ngor spent the day at a youth summer camp at the People's Liberation Army barracks in Fanling.
In the city centre, protesters vowed they would not stop unless their demands were met. University student Aaron Yam, 20, said a key demand was for an ""independent and fair inquiry"" into police handling of the demonstrations. ""The only way out is to have a fair inquiry into the policing of recent protests,"" he said.
Meanwhile, a group of civil servants from various departments issued a statement saying they would organise a rally to support protesters on Friday, estimating about 500 would take part. It will be the first time a group of civil servants have joined the protests.
All eyes will now be on Beijing, but mainland observers said the central government was unlikely to announce any measures that could resolve the crisis.
""It's likely the officials will reprimand advocates of Hong Kong independence ... as well as express support to the Hong Kong government and its police force,"" Zhang Dinghui, a Hong Kong policy researcher with Shenzhen University, said.
But analysts expected major policy adjustments were likely to be taking place behind the scenes."
South China Morning Post,2019-11-10,"Press bodies decry attacks on media crewman, vehicles TVB cameraman attacked by protesters after vig",412 ,"
Press groups have condemned attacks on a cameraman and company vehicle from two city media outlets, after vigils ­mourning the death of a ­university student turned ugly.
As people came to terms with the loss of student Chow Tsz-lok, who suffered a severe brain injury in a car park fall earlier this week, protesters unleashed late-night violence in several districts.
A TVB cameraman was attacked at 10pm on Friday as he was covering protests in Mong Kok. He said a few protesters approached him and asked whether he was from the network, and attacked after he confirmed that he was. ""They snatched my camera and tripod, threw them to the ground and smashed them with iron bars,"" he said in a TVB news report. ""Some say they only hit machines not men, but a few had come over to me and hurt my neck and legs.""
He was treated in hospital and filed a police report.
Local online media outlet, HK01, was also targeted at about 1am yesterday.
Its vehicle parked in Tseung Kwan O, a protest site at the time, was smashed, and slogans were sprayed on the car.
The Hong Kong News Executives' Association condemned the attack of the cameraman, and ­appealed for the public to respect the work of the press.
""Journalists can only report the facts and truth without interference and fear,"" it said.
The Hong Kong Journalists ­Association and Hong Kong Press Photographers Association issued a joint statement, asking for an end to interference in ­reporters' work and violent acts targeting them.
Critics have accused sectios of the media, especially the city's biggest television broadcaster, of favouring the government and the pro-establishment camp in coverage of the protests.
A court earlier turned down an urgent application from TVB to prohibit anyone from assaulting its crew or damaging its property.
On Friday night, some of the vigils for Chow turned ugly, with Tseung Kwan O, where he fell to his death, the scene for some of the night's worst violence.
Some protesters set firn e an electrical control box outside Sheung Tak Plaza. Loud bangs and a stream of black smoke came from the box before firefighters ­arrived to put out the flames.
A group of protesters threw petrol bombs at riot police near Man Kuk Lane, and officers returned fire with shots from non-lethal weapons. At least one reporter was hit in the exchanges.
More clashes broke out in Beverly Garden, where police at one point used pepper spray and aimed guns at reporters, with security guards failing to mediate."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-11,Nip rejects fresh calls for political reforms Minister says demand 'irresponsible' given chaotic env,369 ,"
The constitutional affairs minister has dismissed calls to restart ­political reforms and introduce universal suffrage in thecity, ­calling the demands ­""irresponsible"".
Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Patrick Nip Tak-kuen also conceded that the current administration was to blame for the recent political crisis - but dodged questions about whether he and the city's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, should step down.
Nip said on a radio programme yesterday morning that ""it would be an irresponsible act for me as the minister with such responsibilities, to rashly restart political reforms under the ­current chaotic political environment where emotions run high and mutual mistrust runs deep.""
He said for the last two years he had urged pan-democratic ­lawmakers to engage with Beijing officials on political ­reforms - but they had been ­reluctant to do so.
Hong Kong has been rocked by street protests arising from ­opposition to the now-suspended extradition bill, which if passed, would have allowed the transfers of criminal suspects to jurisdictions with which the city has no such arrangements, notably the mainland.
Nip condemned the violence at recent protests, and said those who defaced the Chinese national emblem and tossed the national flag into Victoria Harbour had challenged the ""one country, two systems"".
Nip said any complaints about police conduct were best handled through established bodies like the Independent Police ­Complaints Council (IPCC), rather than an independent ­investigation into the use of force at recent protests as demanded by protesters.
He said the complaints body had already started looking into the incident on July 21, when a white-clad mob attacked ­protesters and civilians in Yuen Long MTR station.
""All these accusations of abuse of power and excessive violence will be handled by the IPCC. Now is not the time to draw any ­conclusions on that,"" he said.
Nip refused to comment on whether he should resign. When asked how he would take ­responsibility for the upheaval in the city, he said: ""When ­considering all questions, we will consider all ­factors before making any ­decisions, then we will ­account to the public on that."""
South China Morning Post,2019-10-11,Apple pulls HK protest map app after backlash Apple pulls protest map app after backlash,679 ,"
Apple yesterday removed from its App Store a Hong Kong location map app that tracks protest activities following a mainland backlash. The about-face came after it approved the app last week.
Users can still access the web version of HKmap.live on their ­iPhones by opening its webpage on their browser. The app also remains available on Google Play for Android smartphone users.
Apple said the HKmap.live app, which crowdsources locations of police and anti-government protesters, violated its rules as it was used to target and ambush officers, victimise residents and threaten public safety.
""We have learned that an app, HKmap.live, has been used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong,"" Apple said in a statement.
""This app violates our guidelines and local laws, and we have removed it from the App Store.""
On the mainland, an app produced by an American media company that has given extensive coverage to the protests in Hong Kong has been removed from ­Apple's domestic App Store for providing ""illegal content"" in the country.
Zach Seward, chief executive of Quartz, which reports on the global economy, said in an interview with technology news website TheVerge.com that his company was being targeted not only because of its reports on the pro-democracy protests but also its articles on how to use virtual private networks to bypass the mainland's strict controls on internet access.
Quartz's website - like those of many media and technology firms, including the South China Morning Post, The New York Times, The Guardian, the BBC, Google and Facebook - is blocked on the mainland. ""We abhor this kind of government censorship of the internet and have great ­coverage of how to get around such bans around the world,"" Seward said.
The developer of HKmap.live, who declined to reveal theiridentity for personal safety concerns, confirmed on Twitter that the app had been removed by ­Apple.
The developer disagreed with claims by Apple and Hong Kong police that the app endangered law enforcement and residents and described the move as ""clearly a political decision to suppress freedom and human rights in Hong Kong"".
Apple first approved the HKmap.live app on October 4, according to the developer, and it shot to the top of the charts for the travel category in the iOS App Store in Hong Kong.
HKmap.live attracted both positive and negative reviews, with one user calling it ""life-saving technology"", while another said it supported lawbreaking and put ""citizens in danger"".
Protesters who joined a demonstration in Tsim Sha Tsui last night accused Apple of bowing to pressure from Beijing.
""Apple should not let politics affect its business or be scared of Beijing,"" said a protester who identified himself as Nathan.
Taiwanese Carrie Tung said Apple's action might make her hesitant to buy any of the company's devices in future.
""I can't believe such a big American company like Apple removed the app under pressure from Beijing,"" Tung said.
""The US is supposed to represent values like freedom. If they can do this, what other unreasonable decisions will they make in the future?""
Tung said she came to join the protests for the seventh time and that she previously downloaded the HKmap.live app to learn the whereabouts of police.
A 26-year-old male protester who declined to be namedderided Apple for being ­influenced by the central ­government.
""If they say the application helps people track down the ­police and harm them, it is only a hypothesis, there is no evidence,"" he said.
Earlier this week, state-owned media outlet People's Daily ­accused Apple of protecting ""rioters"" in Hong Kong and enabling illegal behaviour.
""By allowing its platform to clear the way for an app that incites illegal behaviour, [does Apple] not worry about damaging its reputation and hurting the feelings of consumers?"" it said in a commentary.
The developer previously told the Post that there was ""no evidence that HKmap.live is illegal"" and stated that they had never received any legal complaints.

South China Morning Post,2019-09-16,Taiwanese keep up support with songs Small group gathers at popular shopping area ahead of rally pla,364 ,"
A small group of Taiwanesegathered in one of Taipei's most popular shopping districts yesterday to sing songs in solidarity with Hong Kong's anti-government protesters.
About 10 people, dressed in black and with masks and yellow helmets, formed a chorus line in the Ximending area at 3pm. They held posters proclaiming ""Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times"".
They sang two songs, Glory to Hong Kong, the new anthem of local demonstrators, and a Cantonese version of Do You Hear the People Sing?, a popular protest song from the musical Les ­Misérables. They also chanted slogans, including ""Five key demands, not one less"", ""Today's Hong Kong is tomorrow's Taiwan"" and ""Overthrow the Chinese Communist Party"".
A similar event was held in Ximending on Friday for the Mid-Autumn Festival. More than 100 Hongkongers living in Taiwan gathered there and sang songs supporting the protesters.
Pro-democracy organisations, including the Taiwan Youth Association for Democracy and the Taiwan Citizen Front, were planning a rally on the island on September 29 to show further support for the protest movement in the city, Taiwanese media reported.
""Hong Kong is facing a long and hard journey and Hong Kong needs support from Taiwan and even the world,"" said an organiser of the rally, who was not named, in a press briefing.
The protests were triggered by a now to be withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed fugitives to be sent to other jurisdictions, including the mainland.
The protests have become the main topic of news programmes and everyday discussions on the self-ruled island.
Earlier this month, the island's Mainland Affairs Council said Taiwan would never accept Beijing's ""one country, two systems"" political framework.
The statement was issued in response to remarks by Sun Yafu, vice-president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, who had accused authorities on the island of helping to plan and support the unrest.
Taiwan's human rights, civil society and NGO groups have held numerous events to show support for demonstrators since the protest broke out in June.
Beijing claims Taiwan as part of China that will be unified, by force if necessary."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-25,MTR pays the price for aiding and abetting protesters JUST SAYING Yonden Lhatoo looks at the chaos p,647 ,"
While everyone was gushing with praise and waxing eloquent about the beauty of Friday night's anti-government rally, when thousands of Hongkongers formed human chains mimicking the historic Baltic Way, the ugly underbelly of the protest movement was on full display at Kwai Fong MTR station.
A mob of hysterical protesters laid siege to the control room, harassing and abusing railway staff after the MTR closed the station early, expecting exactly that kind of behaviour following a previous night of protest anarchy on the premises.
As if yelling expletives at traumatised frontline railway workers and spray-painting obscenities on the walls were not foul enough, one protester saw fit to express his contempt for the MTR by urinating into a beer can right there and then, in full public view, like some wild animal, while his unhinged comrades pasted sanitary pads on the glass walls of the control booth. Our reporter at the scene spotted what looked like a used pad among them.
Who are these people? Is this really us? Is this what we have become in this great ""revolution of our times""? I'm struggling to understand any of it; perhaps some psychiatrist can explain.
What's clear enough is that the protesters have turned against the city's railway operator and now transformed its train stations into battlefields to lash out at the MTR as well as confront the police.
They're even more aggrieved after the MTR secured a court injunction to stop protesters from ""unlawfully and wilfully obstructing or interfering with the proper use of the stations and trains of the railway network"". The injunction forbids people from ""damaging any property or trains and using any threatening, abusive, obscene or offensive language or wilfully interfering with the comfort or convenience of any MTR staff at any station"".
Good luck enforcing it, though, when tormenting and attacking fully armed police officers has replaced horse racing as Hong Kong's favourite pastime, and citizens have the freedom to firebomb police stations with impunity - how is a little court order going to make any difference to mob rule?
Sorry to say, the MTR is paying the price for essentially aiding and abetting the protesters these past months. Not only has the rail operator allowed radicals to use stations as convenient safe zones they can retreat into after every bout of violence, and to rely on the network to travel to the next target, its staff have been openly hostile to police coming in after the lawbreakers. Some employees have even been accused of leaking internal plans to protesters to help them sabotage and disrupt operations.
It's astonishing that the government, with a 75 per cent stake in the MTR, did nothing about it, and that it's taken the outrage broadcast by Chinese state media across the border to shame them into clamping down on the problem at last.
""The MTR dared to arrange special train services for the rioters and even sent them home free of charge,"" an incredulous news anchor declared on state television, referring to repeated instances of protesters being ferried home for free after battling police and trashing train stations.
Just a week ago, when riot police stormed into Kwai Fong station and fired tear gas in an enclosed space for the first time as they chased after a violent mob, the MTR complained about passenger safety being put at risk by police - not a peep about what the protesters were doing in the first place.
Well, just like it did with Cathay Pacific Airways, Beijing has forced the city's government-owned railway operator to stand up and be counted, and for staff to stop biting the hand that's feeding them.
Be assured of more shocking confrontations in the days to come, and commuting chaos for nearly 5 million passengers who use the railway network daily. Things have gone completely off the rails.
Yonden Lhatoo is the chief news editor at the Post"
South China Morning Post,2019-08-19,Cathay probes claim of pro-protest letter from staff,514 ,"
Cathay Pacific Airways yesterday said it was investigating online ­rumours about an anonymous letter said to be from its ­employees, reiterating their ­support for the ongoing anti-government protests in the city.
""While we cannot confirm the authenticity of this letter, we are taking the matter very seriously and are conducting an internal investigation,"" the airline said in a statement.
Cathay has come under intense pressure from Beijing, after some of its staff supported the protests that have been going on for nearly three months.
Over the past fortnight, the airline sacked two pilots for being involved in the protests, and also two ground staff. There has also been a major shake-up at the top, with the airline's chief executive officer, ­Rupert Hogg, and one of his key deputies, Paul Loo Kar-pui, ­resigning last Friday.
The anonymous letter, claiming to be from Cathay employees, attacked the Hong Kong government for not responding positively to protesters, including the estimated 2 million people who marched on June 16.
It criticised Beijing for using flight safety as an excuse to enforce political suppression and get employees sacked for supporting the protests, saying this was ""white terror"" against freedom of speech.
Earlier this month, China's civil aviation regulator issued a major safety risk warning to ­Cathay and demanded that the airline submit the crew lists for all flights going over mainland airspace and said crew members who supported the protests would be barred from flying.
The anonymous letter repeated the protesters' five demands - that the Hong Kong government withdraw the extradition bill which triggered the protests; that it retract the characterisation of the protests as riots; withdraw criminal charges against protesters and release those currently ­detained; hold a full, independent inquiry into the actions ofpolice; and implement universal suffrage.
Yesterday, Cathay reiterated that it condemned the violence during the protests and the ongoing disruption in the city. It said it would follow all rules and regulations on civil aviation laid down by Hong Kong, the mainland and other jurisdictions it flew to.
The airline had earlier made clear its full backing for the ­administration of Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, the government, police and the ­principle of ""one country, two ­systems"".
It has also warned employees that it was taking a zero-tolerance approach to any unacceptable behaviour related to the protests.
Meanwhile, the flight attendants unions of Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon have urged their members to back the company and refrain from making political statements, given the heightened scrutiny of the airline.
""Be extra cautious [about] actions and words made outside working hours [that] may cause significant effect on every one of us now,"" the unions said in a joint statement.
Expressing sadness over the departure of Hogg and Loo, who were both well-liked, the unions asked members to try and put the past behind them. ""We shall all work together to overcome any weakness, any despair and fear."""
South China Morning Post,2019-11-17,Tense moments as residents heed clean-up calls,770 ,"
Hong Kong residents turned out in force yesterday to clear bricks and other blockages from main roads near some of the city's ­university campuses, after five straight days of escalated protest action and traffic mayhem.
Heeding online calls from pro-establishment figures, hundreds of people dismantled barricades built with metal railings, bricks and other obstacles and placed them on pavements and in trucks near Hong Kong, Baptist, Chinese and Polytechnic universities.
The clean-up was punctuated by several tense moments. ­Arguments and minor scuffles broke out between black-clad protesters and those clearingPok Fu Lam Road outside the ­University of Hong Kong.
At about 3.45pm, about a dozen protesters sat in front of one of the barricades, which ­residents dismantled around them, but they later retreated to overpasses linked to the university, heckling the clearers andat one point throwing several burning objects onto the road.
In Kowloon Tong, near Baptist University, about 50 soldiers, many dressed in green T-shirts and black shorts, from the ­People's Liberation Army's ­barracks marched out at about 4.30pm and joined pro-government supporters to help remove roadblocks and reopen Renfrew Road and Hereford Road.
In escalated action this week, demonstrators paralysed traffic by ­setting up roadblocks on the city's main thoroughfares, including at the Cross-Harbour Tunnel in Hung Hom, and occupying some university campuses.
Most residents involved in the Pok Fu Lam clearance operation believed the roadblocks hadgone too far. ""I think everyone is upset, because our community is blocked off. I have an 18-month-old and she hasn't been able to go outside, so I just thought I would come down and see what I could do,"" said a resident, surnamed Tam, 32.
Another resident, Tim ­Plunkett, who also helped clear the road, said: ""It feels like it's definitely escalated. I sympathise with the protesters and I understand the rationale, but I think it's shifted and gone too far.""
He said his opinion shifted when someone threw a bin in front of a minibus he was in.
HKU alumna Jessica Poon, 49, was shocked protesters threw ­objects from the overpass. ""This is unprecedented, we don't have any tear gas, why did they throw this at us? We are not fighting them,"" she said.
Three masked protesters showed up in the early afternoon to watch, with one saying they were just checking if the residents were doing ""something safe"".
""For me it's totally fine, we don't want any conflict with ­citizens, they are not the audience or our target, but it's best if they don't interrupt,"" said the protester, 20, who was not a student but lived nearby. ""Let's see how this ends up, we may decide to rebuild it.""
But other protesters felt more strongly, with a larger group of about a dozen lighting charcoal, temporarily filling the road with smoke to clear the residents. Soon afterwards they began ­fortifying the blockades, while a number of residents carried on removing bricks. There were also civil ­discussions as residents, mainly expatriates, questioned the tactics of protesters, who tried to explain why they felt the need to escalate their actions.
Later, several trucks arrived to assist in the ­clearing, and some police vans, with residents chanting their support for the force, with a few shouting ""police add oil"".
At Baptist University, the atmosphere remained quiet as protesters had left their barriers when other residents arrivedto clear them. Office workerTim Leung, 45, said he came to ""restore peace"".
""I don't live in the district and only came here after seeing online calls. I am upholding the rights of other road users to take this road to get to places and go about their lives,"" he said.
At Chinese University in Sha Tin, a sense of calm ­returned ­although debris lay ­scattered around after intense clashes ­between protesters and police earlier in the week. Hundreds of students, graduates and staff turned up for the clearance.
Chan, 30, who holds a master's degree, went to pick up ""useful materials"". ""The masks, helmets and medical materials are expensive. So many people donated money and materials to the protesters, we must not waste them,"" Chan said, adding that he would store some gear at home for future demonstrations.
A research assistant surnamed Ng said he was disappointed the university wanted to stop people from entering the campus.
""The school is going to throw away all the materials regardless of what they are, just to return the campus to normality. But the school won't just return to normal after clearing up, the management needs to keep talking to the students,"" Ng said."
South China Morning Post,2019-06-13,Win some and lose some for Businesses in admiralty Hungry horde keeps restaurants and convenience st,711 ,"
The spiralling protest in Admiralty against the extradition bill yesterday had a mixed effect on businesses in the area, with some forced to close temporarily while others did brisk trade, to the point of leaving some emptied of stock.
The thousands of protesters who surrounded the government complex in Tamar hampered road access to commercial buildings such as the Admiralty Centre, the United Centre and Citic Tower, while cars were intentionally parked in the middle of ­Harcourt Road to block traffic.
The blocked roads and unfolding chaos prompted many shops at the International Finance ­Centre in Central, about 1km from Admiralty, to shut their doors early for the day.
Among those that closed were the Apple Store, Lane Crawford, NARS, SK-II, Yves Saint Laurent and Chanel.
A spokeswoman for an ­upmarket Chinese restaurant in the building said the difficulty travelling and uncertainty caused by the protests prompted a number of customers to cancel dinner bookings.
In Admiralty, bank services were suspended, with branches and centres of HSBC, Hang Seng Bank, Standard Chartered, Bank of East Asia and DBS forced to shut until further notice.
Some restaurants, however, had a good run of business as ­protesters ate before returning to the streets.
Yesterday, restaurants in Citic Tower were swamped with hungry protesters. They sat peacefully on the floor, eating lunch and chatting with each other.
At Citic Tower, protester Yin Yuen-yan, a 20-year-old student, wolfed down the last lunchbox sold by Chinese takeaway store Original Taste Workshop.
Finding food was not easy, with hundreds of protesters ­taking a lunch break in the air-conditioned building.
""I went looking through two or three floors before I found somewhere to eat,"" Yin said.
The protesters, mostly younger people, gathered outside the government and Legislative Council complex in an attempt to derail the planned second reading of the extradition bill at 11am ­yesterday. Legco postponed the meeting until further notice.
Shelves at a convenience store in Citic Tower, were practically bare after lunchtime due to high demand and suspended deliveries of new stock.
""No deliveries are reaching our store, not even newspapers,"" an employee who preferred to remain anonymous said. ""I think we are making more money than usual today but we haven't totted it all up yet. As you can see, there are lots of people.""
The shop was also running out of change and asked customers to pay by Octopus card.
Mr Tomahawk, a Western steakhouse at Citic Tower, was having difficulty getting ingredients and supplies delivered.
""Supplies are usually dropped off at around 10am. But none have arrived yet,"" employee Karen Fu Zhi-kai said. ""Our place usually serves office workers, but today there are way more protesters in the restaurant.""
In the Admiralty Centre, the atmosphere was tenser later in the afternoon, with protesters ­occasionally shouting and urging people to run and injured marchers coming in to look for shelter. A shop owner opened her kitchen to protesters to wash tear gas out of their eyes.
In the shopping area of the ­Admiralty Centre, rice ball store Hana-Musubi saw a 50 per cent rise in sales, with stocks eventually running out. ""The roads are blocked so the rice balls cannot be delivered. We sent a colleague out to get supplies instead,"" staff member Chai Hoi-ching said. The shop switched to selling siu mai dumplings and other hot food.
On the ground floor of ­the ­Admiralty Centre, a fashion ­boutique was closed for the day, with large yellow posters in its windows calling for ""urgent prayers for Hong Kong"" as the city ""is in trouble"".
Self-employed taxi driver, Wong Po-keung, 72, said he lost about a third of his usual business. ""If you need to get from Causeway Bay to Admiralty, there is only one way through Kennedy Road and that requires making a big U-turn,"" he said. ""Protesters should consider our livelihood by not blocking off the roads.""
Professor Andy Kwan Cheuk-chiu, director of the ACE Centre for Business and Economic ­Research, believed the disruption to business in Admiralty would last at most for one to two weeks.
""This time the impact is more on Admiralty, unlike with the ­Occupy movement, which also ­affected Causeway Bay, Mong Kok and Central,"" he said."
South China Morning Post,2019-07-24,"Xi acted 'responsibly' in HK protests, Trump says",481 ,"
After a night of violent unrest in Hong Kong that left dozens of protesters hurt by a mob of attackers, US President Donald Trump said President Xi ­Jinping had acted ""responsibly"" in allowing the demonstrations to continue.
""I'm not involved in it very much but I think President Xi of China has acted responsibly, very responsibly,"" Trump told reporters in the White House on ­Monday when asked about the previous night's violence. ""They've been out there protesting for a long time.""
Seven weeks of demonstrations against proposed changes to Hong Kong's extradition laws have been punctuated by violent clashes between protesters and police, fuelling Hongkongers' anger at the city government, whose embattled leader ­continues to resist calls to resign.
But events took a bloody turn on Sunday night when a horde of men, dressed in white and brandishing poles and bats, unleashed an apparently coordinated attack on protesters, journalists and passers-by in Yuen Long, leaving at least 45 people injured.
The police force has come under renewed criticism over the attack and the revelation that ­officers did not reach the scene of the violence until 35 minutes after the rampage was reported.
The delay prompted claims that the local authorities knowingly allowed the attacks to happen, suspicions that grew when a pro-Beijing lawmaker was filmed shaking hands with a group of white-clad men.
Sharing a video on Twitter of the attackers, many of whom made no effort to conceal their faces, US Senator Marco Rubio said on Monday: ""They didn't seem too concerned about getting caught or stopped by the authorities. It isn't hard to figure out who sent them.""
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has dismissed as ""groundless"" the accusations that her administration or the police force colluded with the mob.
The South China Morning Post previously reported that the more than 100 men who carried out Sunday's attacks included members of the city's 14K and Wo Shing Wo triad gangs.
Six people were arrested on Monday night for their involvement in the violence, with the city authorities saying more arrests could follow.
Trump did not directly ­address Sunday night's events, but called the ongoing protests ""relatively non-violent"". He said he hoped Xi would ""do the right thing"", without elaborating.
""China could stop [the protests] if they wanted,"" the US leader said.
A wave of criticism launched at the protesters by Beijing via its state media apparatus on ­Monday made no mention of the violent attacks, although a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said the government condemned ""all violent behaviour"".
Meanwhile, the central government's envoy to Hong Kong, Wang Zhimin, whose office building was besieged by egg- and paint-throwing protesters on Sunday, said the demonstrators' actions ""seriously hurt the feelings of all Chinese people, including seven million Hongkongers""."
South China Morning Post,2019-09-28,Musical movements Music and anthems which are common in demonstrations worldwide have been used by r,1228 ,"
Hundreds of students and staff of Po Leung Kuk Celine Ho Yam Tong College, a top secondary school in Wong Tai Sin, Kowloon, were gathered solemnly in the hall as the national anthem began playing.
But the first line of March of the Volunteers - ""Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves"" - was drowned out when most of the students began singing: ""Do you hear the people sing/Singing the song of angry men/It is the music of the people who will not be slaves again.""
For the entire duration of the anthem, played over the loudspeakers, they repeated the chorus of the revolutionary song from the musical version of Victor Hugo's classic, Les Misérables.
The teachers did not stop the students. But addressing the school a few minutes later, principal Lam Siu-kuen urged them to seek common ground amid their political differences, and maintain harmony on campus.
A video of the ceremony marking the start of the new school year quickly went viral online, with many internet users praising the students for their courage, and the teachers for being open-minded and not interrupting their protest.
A smaller number criticised the students for insulting China and demanded accountability from the principal.
As increasingly violent anti-government protests in the city continue for a fourth month, ­music has become a significant part of the action, with rival sides making political statements with their choice and treatment of songs.
This is seen in the growing popularity of Glory to Hong Kong, a new song that has captured the imagination of protesters.
The original Cantonese song first made its rounds on LIHKG, a forum popular among protesters where they can share information, in late August. But it has since spread across the city with different versions emerging, including renditions in English, Japanese, Korean, and one with full orchestral backing.
""Music is powerful and it can bring people participating in a social movement together to have common thinking,"" says music and history scholar Edmond Tsang Yik-man.
Music has long been part of social movements worldwide. Reverend Martin Luther King Jnr, a prominent leader in the civil rights movement in the United States, called freedom songs ""the soul of the movement"". King was assassinated in 1968.
At Po Leung Kuk Celine Ho Yam Tong College earlier this month, both the national anthem and Do You Hear the People Sing? express the desire to break free from a life of enslavement. But in Hong Kong's ongoing social unrest, each has taken on a radically different meaning.
Do You Hear the People Sing? is one of the main songs in Les Misérables, set in 19th-century France and centres on the June Rebellion of 1832. Originally in French, it has been translated into other languages including English and Cantonese, and has figured as a protest song in places such as Venezuela, Turkey and now, Hong Kong.
Protesters in the city have been singing the song during marches and at demonstrations on ­campuses as well as in shopping centres.
Tsang, who is also a composer, says its lyrics and music structure suit the social movement.
""The lyrics are about protests and demands not being heard,"" he says.
He notes that the song's rhythm, which consists of notes of unequal length, arouses emotions, fitting the mood when people march.
This musical device is also used for Glory to Hong Kong, an original composition now regarded as the de facto anthem of the protest movement.
""It is easy to immerse yourself in the music while singing or walking, which is why the song resonated with many Hongkongers quickly when it came out,"" the musician says.
Daniel, a protester in his late twenties, says the line ""Why is it that even though we are bleeding, the marching sound is still ­resounding?"" reminds him of events Hongkongers went through in the past few months, such as a young woman protester suffering a serious eye injury, and a mob attacking protesters and residents in Yuen Long in July.
Daniel, who does not want to give his real name, finds it ­significant that the song ­originates from the online forum LIHKG, and is composed by a musician who wishes to be known only as ""Thomas dgx yhl"", while lyrics are by users of the site.
""I am humming the song to myself all the time,"" he says.
Another popular song at the protests is rock band Beyond's 1993 hit Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies, with its chorus about the ­desire to fight for freedom and pursue dreams. It was adopted as the unofficial anthem of the 2014 pro-democracy Occupy movement, which shut down several parts of Hong Kong for 79 days.
Tsang believes Glory to Hong Kong, which was composed for the current protests, will now eclipse the Beyond hit as a protest song for this movement.
The singing has not been limited to anti-government protesters. Pro-Beijing groups too have increasingly been raising their voices in public.
Employing tactics similar to protesters with opposing views, pro-China residents have also taken to the malls for flash mobs of the national anthem in recent weeks, with a group of them appearing at Pacific Place in Admiralty earlier this week.
Simon Zhang, who works in the financial sector, says he joined the singalong in the mall as he could not bear protesters' ­violence and negative sentiments towards China.
""The protesters have taken away our freedom to travel on public transport to go to work, shop and eat,"" says Zhang, who works in Admiralty but lives in To Kwa Wan.
He moved to Hong Kong from the mainland five years ago and intended to make the city his permanent home, but the recent protests have him worried about Hong Kong's status as an international financial hub.
""I had goosebumps after hearing everyone sing the national anthem,"" he says. ""We must use our voice to stand up for China.""
Glory to Hong Kong has also caught attention on the mainland, but not for quite the same reasons as it did with protesters in the city.
On September 14, the Weibo account of People's Daily shared a version of the song with new lyrics and a new title roughly translating as ""wishing for the truth to save Hong Kong"".
The post read: ""Recently, those causing chaos in Hong Kong have introduced a Hong Kong independence song.""
The post said the new version served to fight independence advocacy. The original Glory to Hong Kong features lyrics such as ""liberate Hong Kong"" and ""revolution of the times"".
But Daniel does not think the song is calling for the breakaway of the city from the mainland, and instead is calling on people not to give up, and creating a sense of togetherness.
The song's composer Thomas has said he hoped the song would bring people together.
Tsang says the speed in the production of different versions of Glory to Hong Kong was a testament to its power as a protest song.
""The orchestral version is very special, giving a high quality and rational touch to the song as ­people will not associate orchestral music with violent protesters,"" Tsang says.
He says the versions in different languages such as English, Japanese and Korean, are also significant as the protesters want foreigners to know about their demands.
Daniel, who has been to ­several singalongs, says he is touched to see different ­Hongkongers, from office workers to road sweepers, coming together to sing with tourists looking on curiously.
""Music brings the local community together and this in itself is material action.""

South China Morning Post,2019-07-02,opinion split as police delayed taking action One former officer says force learned lesson after tac,781 ,"
As protesters stormed the Legislative Council complex yesterday, police sources said the force adopted a restrained approach and did not take clearance action to avoid affecting the majority who protested peacefully.
At around 9pm, hundreds of anti-extradition bill protesters finally broke into Legco after hours of attacking the public entrance and ransacked the building. They also displayed the colonial Hong Kong flag in the chamber.
Despite the escalation, analysts believed police took only minimal action to avoid more conflict while letting people ­differentiate between violent and peaceful protesters.
Tensions deepened at about 6pm as some protesters continued to ram the Legco building's glass doors with steel bars.
About 1,000 riot police stationed inside retreated when radicals broke in, the Post was told.
Asked whether the size of the crowd stopped police from carrying out a clearance operation, one law enforcement source said: ""Police were considering a ­number of factors.""
Officers in riot gear stood ­behind glass doors and gates as protesters used metal gates, barriers and metal poles to smash windows and glass doors. Officers did raise banners warning they would use force if protesters charged.
They pepper-sprayed protesters from inside but none came out to disperse them.
Tensions started to escalate at about 4am when a large number of protesters began to mass and dashed onto Lung Wo Road, Tim Mei Avenue and Harcourt Road in Admiralty, blocking roads and ­obstructing traffic.
""At the same time, some protesters stole iron poles and bricks from a nearby construction site and guard rails from nearby roads. They also pried bricks on Lung Wo Road and transported them towards the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition ­Centre,"" Senior Superintendent Kelvin Kong Wing-cheung from police public relations said.
At about 7.30am, thousands poured onto Harcourt Road with some charging police and hurling objects. Police used pepper spray to disperse the crowd with more than 200 officers from the Special Tactical Squad in a stand-off with protesters on Lung Hop Street and Lung Wo Road.
But two hours later some ­protesters changed tactics by splashing an unidentified liquid believed to be drain cleaner at ­officers during violent clashes around the legislative and administrative centre.
Thirteen officers were taken to hospital with minor injuries such as swollen and itchy skin and breathing difficulties. They were later discharged.
At around 1pm, about 1,500 protesters gathered around Legco with some using a metal cart to pound the glass door for about two hours. Despite condemning the violence, police did not act.
Kong said the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau had taken up the cases. ""For all the ­illegal behaviour, we will strictly follow up and investigate every suspected case,"" he said.
Security consultant and ­former superintendent Clement Lai Ka-chi believed the force took a tolerant approach as it learned a lesson from its heavy-handed crackdown on June 12 when tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds were fired into crowds surrounding the legislature.
""Society has changed. If they overreact, they may easily cause a public backlash. They need to change their tactics to appease the public,"" he said.
That crackdown caused a public outcry culminating in a march four days later that organisers said drew nearly 2 million against the now-suspended bill.
However, Steve Vickers, CEO of risk consultant SVA and former head of the police's criminal intelligence bureau, warned that if the force did not move in a much more determined manner then matters might eventually be taken out of its hands.
""What is now happening in Legco is mob rule - not legitimate political expression,"" he said. ""There will be damage to Hong Kong as a consequence of these global TV images.""
He said the violent protesters had lost public support as they ruined the progress made by the wider peaceful movement.
""The flying of the colonial flag inside Legco is stupid and ignorant and deliberately calculated to inflame the central government and its supporters and to provoke some form of intervention for extra tough action on the ground,"" he warned.
Lai said there was a clear differentiation between peaceful protesters and rioters, with the latter a well-organised group out to cause damage.
""I think the police have so far withheld action because they want to have an accurate assessment of the situation and the rioters' intentions. They also want the public have a clearer picture about who the rioters are and the drastic actions they can take.
""Then when the police finally take action against the rioters they can easily gain the understanding of the public,"" he said."
South China Morning Post,2019-06-10,SOLIDARITY AND DEFIANCE Organisers say more than a million take to the streets in protest against co,951 ,"
Protesters of all ages and from all walks of life flooded the streets of Hong Kong in historic numbers yesterday in a stunning show of solidarity and defiance against the government's controversial ­extradition bill.
Organisers declared the turnout to be more than 1 million, double that of the 2003 mass rally that led to the city's then-leader stepping down.
It was the strongest display of people power to challenge the leadership of embattled Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng ­Yuet-ngor as wave upon wave of protesters washed over the northern part of Hong Kong Island.
Traffic came to a grinding halt from early afternoon to late at night, as the protesters made their way through the canyon of skyscrapers from Victoria Park to the Legislative Council.
Such was the size of the crowds that they were still flocking to the rallying point long after the first marchers had left, and the tail end of the rally was still in Causeway Bay as night fell.
Many others trying to join were unable to because of police crowd-control measures. Train stations were swamped and traffic was chaotic, with some drivers even leaving cars on the road.
Organising group Civil ­Human Rights Front claimed a historic turnout at 1.03 million, while police reduced it to a more conservative estimate of 240,000 at its peak.
At the July 1 rally in 2003, police estimated the number was 350,000 before its peak, while ­organisers claimed it was more than 500,000. That public backlash against the government's push for national security legislation prompted then-chief executive Tung Chee-hwa to step down.
This time, the city's leader has vowed not to back down, with enough votes promised by her political allies in Legco to pass her bill, which would allow the transfer of fugitives to the mainland and other jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has no extradition deal.
""Will anyone still believe Carrie Lam any more if she continues to claim that there is only a small number of people opposing the bill?"" said former opposition lawmaker Margaret Ng Ngoi-yee, who was among the hundreds of pan-democrat leaders and activists at the rally.
Describing yesterday's march as a new start for Hong Kong, she said: ""We have so many groups, so many schools, even housewives, even new migrants, even horse racing fans ... so many different groups joined the protest on their own initiative.""
Protesters also chanted slogans demanding Lam's resignation. ""Down, down, Carrie Lam,"" and ""No extradition to China,"" they shouted.
The chief executive chose to spend her Sunday officiating a ceremony at Ocean Park.
A government source said the extradition bill would still be put before Legco for debate and a vote, regardless of the turnout.
""What needs to be done to achieve justice has to be done. One cannot just let criminals escape justice because we don't trust the mainland system,"" the source said, reiterating the ­government's argument that the bill was needed to plug alegal loophole that was allowinga Hongkonger accused ofmurdering his girlfriend in ­Taiwan to avoid extradition to the island.
He pointed out that 710,000 people had added their names to a signature campaign to support the bill, and their voices could not be ignored.
A government spokesman said it had listened carefully to ­different views on over the past four months and made two revisions to bill.
The government will table the bill for its second reading on June 12, bypassing the usual process of scrutiny by a bills committee, and hopes to have it passed by the end of the current legislative term next month.
Lam and her top officials have repeatedly stressed that there are provisions under the law to stop people from being persecutedfor political or religiousbeliefs, and that Hong Kong's judiciary can play the role of gatekeeper for fugitive transfer requests.
Front convenor Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit said: ""It is not the end of the story. If the government continues to refuse to heed the people's voices, there will be more and bigger protests.""
He said protesters would be mobilised to besiege Legco next in the coming days.
The rally was largely peaceful, except for isolated scuffles and some rogue incidents. Police had to use pepper spray at one point as several masked protesters ran out onto the road and tried to block traffic outside government headquarters in Admiralty.
Earlier, seven men were arrested for criminal damage, theft and assault during the march.
Hundreds of diehard protesters remained at the Admiraltyfinishing point long after therally officially ended at about 10pm. Some sat in front of the metal barricade to block the car park entrance to the legislature in a stand-off with police.
Opposition to the bill went global yesterday, with similar protests being staged in 29 cities in 12 countries and regions, from New York and London to Tokyo and Taipei, mainly by Hongkongers living overseas.
With Beijing officially throwing its weight behind Lam to push the bill, it was unlikely to have a change of heart after yesterday's rally, according to Lau Siu-kai, a vice-chairman of semi-official think tank The Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies.
""The issue now is more than the extradition bill. To the Beijing leaders, it is a showdown between China and foreign influence,""he said, referring to the campaign against the bill by Westernbusiness chambers andconsulates.
""Unlike the 2003 protest when it was Beijing versus the Hong Kong opposition camp, this time it is Beijing versus the US and its allies.""

South China Morning Post,2019-10-22,Is Nobel Peace Prize an honouror a curse_ Peter Kammerer warns of the baggage attached to being nomi,698 ,"
Hong Kong protesters need to be reminded. The China of July 1, 1997, is not the China of 2019. Under President Xi Jinping, Beijing has become confident, strong and arrogant. There is no leeway for demands to be met, nor a willingness to acknowledge peaceful agitation. The fate of Liu Xiaobo, the only Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate, is evidence enough.
The recent Nobel Prize awards make me think of Liu. Norwegian member of parliament, Guri Melby, last Tuesday nominated Hong Kong's protesters for the next peace prize, contending that they deserved the high-profile award on the grounds that they ""risk their lives and security every day to stand up for freedom of speech and basic democracy"".
Such ideals were the same as those of Liu, an academic and poet turned activist, jailed by Beijing for his beliefs and died in custody. The obvious difference is that under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong is supposed to remain substantially freer than the mainland, and its citizens are promised a more democratic future than at present.
Liu was, from the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in 1989 until his death at 61 from liver cancer on July 13, 2017, a leading figure in the mainland's democracy and human rights movement. He believed in peaceful protest, expressing it through his writings and hunger strikes. For that, he was harassed and imprisoned, the last time in 2009 for 11 years for incitement to subvert state power.
It was for his part in Charter 08, a manifesto drawn up with other activists calling on the Communist Party to implement 19 governing changes, including an independent judicial system, election of public officials, freedom of expression, and truth and reconciliation.
The Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 gave him and his cause international recognition, but also in the eyes of his supporters, a death sentence. Beijing was furious at the Norwegian prize committee's decision, the foreign ministry thundering that ""Liu Xiaobo is a criminal who has been sentenced by Chinese judicial departments for violating Chinese law"".
Soon after, political and diplomatic relations with Norway were frozen and did not thaw for six years.
Protesters in Hong Kong who have turned to violence and vandalism and confronted police have come in for Beijing's full wrath. Peaceful protesters have not been similarly condemned, although the central government has warned it will not tolerate efforts to threaten its authority. Foreign governments have been repeatedly accused of interfering through their voiced support of the democracy movement. Melby's announcement was given the same treatment, with a foreign ministry spokesman saying ""Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs and no foreign governments or individuals have the right to interfere"", but it can only be guessed what would happen should the protesters be named Nobel laureates.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor's refusal to even acknowledge the massive peaceful protests that have repeatedly brought the city's main streets to a standstill is why a minority of demonstrators have resorted to violence to garner attention. They have obviously gone too far with their attacks on police and vandalism.
Only one of the protesters' five demands have been met and it is unlikely the remainder ever will be; the government's relative inaction indicates its hands are tied and the reason can only be that Beijing is calling the shots. Such intervention in the city's domestic affairs would have been unthinkable before Xi, but under his rule, Beijing's commentary has become almost an everyday occurrence.
Concern about the erosion of freedom of speech and expression, one of Hong Kong's main strengths over the rest of the nation, is one reason for the protests. Another advantage, judicial independence, comes under attack each time Beijing echoes police rulings that protesters involved in clashes have been guilty of particular crimes, even before investigations and cases have gone to court.
Liu sought such ideals for his nation and he and his family suffered for the efforts. Hong Kong's protesters should be ever mindful of that.Peter Kammerer is a senior writer at the Post"
South China Morning Post,2019-09-24,"Newspaper rewards its assaulted journalist Global Times gives Fu Guohao 100,000 yuan for 'outstandin",278 ,"
The mainland reporter assaulted by protesters at the airport last month has been awarded 100,000 yuan (HK$110,000) for his ""work performance"" by his employer, the nationalist Global Times.
Fu Guohao was seized, kicked and hit with umbrellas repeatedly on August 13 after he refused to show his press credentials and was found with a T-shirt in his backpack featuring the slogan ""I love HK police"".
""Fu Guohao and our other colleagues who have shown outstanding performance in the reporting of Hong Kong [protests] have been awarded. Fu has received the highest award of 100,000 yuan,"" Global Times ­editor-in-chief Hu Xijin announced on Weibo.
At an awards ceremony on Sunday, Hu said Fu had ""not been earning much"" from his work at  Global Times and had been renting a flat in Beijing.
""We jokingly said we hoped the 100,000 yuan would bring him good luck, and that he can buy a flat and be married one day,"" Hu said.
Fu was one of two men seized at the airport by black-clad protesters who tied his hands. The other man was suspected of being an undercover agent after sticks were found in his backpack.
Fu was discharged after treatment at Princess Margaret Hospital in Kwai Chung hours after the assault and said in an interview that he had not admitted he was a journalist for ""self-protection"".
He also denied asking protesters to hit him, although he was heard asking them to do so in a video.
Within hours of the attacks, state media started posting condemnations of the protesters and sought to rally support for the two victims.
Since the incident Fu has been hailed a ""real hero"" by mainland state media and has received huge support from the nation's online community."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-11,Hundreds occupy airport for second day of sit-in,737 ,"
Hundreds of black-clad demonstrators descended on Hong Kong International Airport to support the second day of an illegal anti-government sit-in yesterday.
By 3.30pm, an estimated 1,000 protesters had joined a handful of others who spent the night in the airport's arrivals hall.
Seated in organised blocks to allow a path for airport staff, they busied themselves by making posters or greeting arriving travellers, and sporadically broke out into chants of ""add oil, Hong Kong!"" and ""fight for freedom, stay with Hong Kong"".
The crowd cheered when a banner carrying the message ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution now"" was unfurled on a walkway on the second floor.
It was removed 15 minutes ­later by a group of men, and ­protesters shouted ""shame on you"" at them.
Many of those present in the morning had stayed overnight to guard supplies left over from the day before, when hundreds had come to greet travellers with anti-government brochures in a bid to win international support.
This was the fourth day in less than three weeks the airport had been affected by the anti-government movement, and airport authorities had increased security ahead of this protest, which began on Friday and will finish today.
""I came over at 8pm yesterday [Friday] after I finished my research,"" Hing Siu-fai, a master's student at Chinese University, said. ""Everyone is very tired.""
Hing said clashes that might disrupt travellers' plans were unlikely to break out at the airport.
Earlier in the morning, energy levels were low among the protesters present, who numbered fewer than 100. Many were sleeping on the floor in the arrivals hall.
Overnight protesters said they expected more to arrive in the afternoon, but did not think the demonstration would be as large, because some who had been present on Friday would be heading to rallies planned at Tai Po and Wong Tai Sin instead.
As it turned out, there were as many if not more demonstrators who eventually turned up by evening.
Posters and brochures were neatly laid on the ground, and included a large message that read ""Welcome to the city of expired tear gas"". Curious onlookers and travellers posed for photos in front of the messages.
Some flights were cancelled yesterday morning due to typhoon warnings. Flights were not disrupted by the sit-in protests on either day.
""My friends and family back home are very worried about us [because of the protest],"" said Shen Hong, 48, whose Cathay Pacific flight to Nanzhou on the mainland had been cancelled. She and her son Chen Hanzhe, 16, had been in Hong Kong on holiday.She said they stayed in their hotel at night because they were worried for their safety.
On Friday, Beijing banned ­Cathay Pacific from using aircrew who had been involved in anti-government protests on flights entering Chinese airspace.
""I've never heard of something like that,"" said Karl Stefan, an American Airlines pilot, referring to China's decision. ""But that sounds like something China would do. They're not that keen on free speech. I'd be worried if I were to do business in China, if they arbitrarily make statements like that.""
Stefan, who has been flying for 34 years, also took some brochures from protesters before his flight to Texas.
Some shops in the airport said the demonstrations had inconvenienced their work, but those the Post spoke to said their businesses had not been adversely affected.
""We normally sell 600 cups, but we sold 1,000 yesterday when there was a huge demonstration,"" said Ambrose Lau, 20, an employee at Tenren's Tea. The drink stall made HK$36,934 on Friday, compared to average sales of around HK$22,000 for the branch, he added.
Employees at Ramen Tonkotsu 8 said the number of customers yesterday did not fall, but the demonstrations had made their work more difficult.
""They're very noisy and annoying. Our customers got angry yesterday because it was so loud we couldn't catch their orders,"" said one employee.
Even though demonstrations at the airport had been peaceful, employees said they could not agree with their methods. ""They're looking down on the Chinese,"" one said. ""When you're in China, you don't fly the American flag.""
Rubbish collection points had been set up by protesters and cleaning staff said the demonstrations had not made their jobs more difficult.
""Maybe it might affect the afternoon shift when more demonstrators show up, but I don't think it will cause much trouble,"" said Chen Hin-wang, an airport worker."
South China Morning Post,2019-07-26,Hear the people sing Cliff Buddle says the government is fiddling while Rome burns and time has come,1089 ,"
The death of Hong Kong has been forecast many times, but the people of this vibrant and ­spirited city have always proved the doubters wrong. In recent weeks, however, even the most optimistic have started to fear Hong Kong is in ­terminal decline. So many qualities that make this city special have been ­undermined.
Protests are daily occurrences. Violent clashes with police have become the norm. The legislature has been ransacked, police headquarters pelted with eggs and Beijing's liaison office daubed with graffiti. Most ­disturbing of all was the brutal, organised attack by stick-wielding assailants on ­protesters and passengers at Yuen Long MTR station last weekend, leaving 45 ­injured. This is not the Hong Kong we know.
The impact of these events, which ­began with peaceful mass protests against the government's misconceived plans for an extradition bill last month, has been ­dramatic. Hong Kong's long-held reputation for the maintenance of law and order has been shattered. Its status as one of the world's safest cities has, at least temporarily, been lost. Tolerance is in short supply as the divisions in society deepen.
Meanwhile, the government, traditionally viewed as efficient and pragmatic, ­appears to have no answers. It is fiddling while Rome burns.
There is, however, still time for Hong Kong to show its characteristic survival ­instincts. With another potentially ­explosive protest planned for Yuen Long ­tomorrow, there is a need for all parties to reflect on how they should proceed.
The protesters are smart and well-organised. They may lack leaders, but they are well-prepared. Their flexible tactics have enabled them, at times, to outflank the police. Peaceful demonstrations attended by hundreds of thousands have often ended in more extreme action by a ­minority. One unusual feature has been that the majority have lent their support to such actions. They feel the same ­frustrations as the young activists on the front line.
But while the protesters have proved tactically adept, the same cannot be said of their strategy. Their demands have, so far, not been met. How are they to make the best use of the support they receive from the community? How is a leaderless movement to take its campaign forward in a way that will bring tangible, lasting results?
The desecration of Beijing's liaison ­office, including the national emblem, has predictably incurred the wrath of the ­central government. No doubt, those ­responsible intended it to do so. This is not helpful at a time when Beijing is considering its own response. Such actions play into the hands of China's hardliners and can only make a crackdown of some kind more likely. The voices of moderation will struggle to be heard when national sensitivities are stirred. But it must be understood that the damaging of national symbols is not a serious challenge to China's sovereignty. People are just venting their anger.
The protesters are fighting for Hong Kong's separate identity and core values. Those are admirable causes. And it is easy to understand why some feel peaceful ­protests do not work, because the ­government has brushed aside even the largest of such demonstrations. But to ­retain support from the community, the protesters must ­honour those values. ­Violence is not one of them. And freedom of expression means tolerating views you do not agree with.
It is not only the protesters who need to reflect. The police have been the target of public anger. They are stretched by the ­protests and morale is low. It is not their fault they have been thrust into the combat zone by the government's failure to find a political solution.
Sometimes, the police have appeared to overreact. Other times they have stood by and watched as the law is flagrantly broken. Why were protesters allowed to raid Legco and escape without arrests? Attacks on ­police headquarters and the liaison office were also allowed to take place.
No doubt, the force faces manpower issues. And a desire to avoid bloodshed is, of course, welcome. But the idea that unlawful behaviour can be tolerated has been ­allowed to take hold. And that is dangerous. It leads people to take the law into their own hands. The outrageous attack in Yuen Long is an example of where that might end.
Many questions about the actions of the police need to be answered. The alarming failure to prevent the Yuen Long attack must be fully explored. It is for the good of the force that failings are identified and ­lessons learned. That is why an independent inquiry is needed.
But the ultimate responsibility for the problems Hong Kong is facing lies with the city's government. Having caused the ­conflict with its plans for an extradition law, which would have seen Hong Kong people sent to the mainland for trial, it is now standing idly by as the violence escalates.
Some suggest it does not know what to do. Others see a sinister plan to allow the troubles to worsen so a crackdown can be justified. Perhaps officials think they can just wait it out, as they did with the Occupy protests in 2014.
Action is needed. There must be a ­circuit-breaker that creates a chance of ­reconciliation. It would not be difficult to meet at least some of the protesters' ­demands. Withdraw the extradition bill - just say that word! Announce an inquiry into recent events. Make it clear that ­peaceful protesters will not be punished. A resignation or two might be needed. Even then, it is not guaranteed the protests will end. But it would show the government is listening and, perhaps, win over the moderate protesters who form the majority.
The central government should avoid a predictable response - blaming foreign ­forces and launching some sort of crackdown. The prospect of the army being used has been exaggerated. But Beijing should avoid tightening its grip in other ways. It is that process of tightening in recent years which has fuelled the protests.
Change of a different kind is required. Hong Kong needs a political system which works for all, not just the privileged few. The young must be given a role in helping shape the future. They have much to contribute.
Hong Kong is not dead - not yet. But it needs all concerned to think carefully about how best to reverse this damaging decline and lift our city from its current gloom.
Violence breeds violence and it must stop. As for the government, it needs to act. In line with the protest theme song, it is time for officials to show that they do hear the people sing.

South China Morning Post,2019-06-11,"Police faced 'organised, armed and prepared radical individuals' Authorities saw choreographed chaos",887 ,"
Organised, prepared, armed and radical - that was the police description of hundreds of young protesters who took on the force across three districts in Hong Kong in the early hours of yesterday.
But on the ground, where clashes and chaos ensued, the faces of the group, many masked, appeared more diverse and complicated than the official profile indicated.
Their organisation was loose but kept secret in an encrypted chat group, their plan was rough, and their levels of readiness and radicalisation varied, the Post has found.
Briefing the media, senior police superintendent Kong Wing-cheung sidestepped questions over whether there had been an operational error that allowed protesters the chance to storm the legislature, despite officers knowing there was every possibility of an unlawful assembly after the rally's permit ended at midnight.
The violence broke soon after, in the Legislative Council's demonstration area, following a historic march when more than a million people, according to the organisers, took to the streets to protest against a controversial extradition bill that would allow the transfer of fugitives to the mainland among other places.
When the march ended at 10pm on Sunday, protesters planned to take over the driveway of Harcourt Road reminiscent of the Occupy protests in 2014, according to messages in the encrypted channel the Post has seen.
They were stopped by special tactics police squirting pepper spray.
Following the attempt, talk began on the chat group of storming the legislative complex. The protesters appeared to be lacking a clear leader.
Still hesitant, they divided into small groups discussing strategy, until a call of ""Let's do it, Hongkongers"" went up and an almost spontaneous decision to escalate their action was taken.
Hundreds of protesters rushed towards the police line in the demonstration area, throwing metal barriers and bottles, and trying to break into the legislative complex.
Police wielding batons and pepper spray pushed back, driving the protesters onto Lung Wo Road.
Clearance operations by police continued for more than three hours, as they forced protesters off Lung Wo Road and divided them into two groups that were channelled towards Central and Wan Chai.
During the chase, protesters lacking any plan of action shouted to their peers, often contradicting each other with chants of ""charge"" or ""leave"", often at the same time.
Their resistance petered out after police dismantled makeshift roadblocks made of metal barriers, rubbish bins and construction screens.
Police took control of the situation after 3.30am, when 370 protesters were rounded up outside the old Wan Chai police station, while others were dispersed near the Central piers and Hennessy Road.
The clashes left eight officers injured, including one who needed 15 stitches to a cut above his eye. Nineteen protesters were arrested for unlawful assembly and 358 were detained and searched.
Dozens of weapons, such as lighters and cutters, and personal belongings including scissors, cable ties, shirts, masks and goggles were seized.
""They were organised, armed and prepared radical individuals,"" said Senior Superintendent Lee Kwai-wah from the organised crime bureau.
But several protesters told the Post they were not members of the encrypted platform and they were just keen to shake the government up.
""I am not in any of those chat groups and I am not in any political party,"" said Tina Chu, a 24-year-old bank clerk sitting on an overturned rubbish bin on Gloucester Road at around 2.40am yesterday.
Chu joined the confrontation on Lung Wo Road soon after 1am and followed the crowd to Wan Chai. ""I did it because so many people had left the march and the government was not answering our demand [to withdraw the bill],"" she said. ""All I want is a positive response from the government.""
Alex Wong, 24, who works in the music industry and Katherine Fung, 25, who works for a press group, stayed to support the radical protesters until 3am. ""I would not use force but I was lending my support to the protesters. If I had gone home and slept, I may have had regrets,"" Fung said.
Both said they felt frustrated over the 2014 Occupy movement and, like many of their peers, Sunday was the first time they had joined a protest since.
Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Journalists Association urged the Commissioner of Police Stephen Lo Wai-chung to explain why police acted harshly and used force on journalists reporting on the clashes.
In a statement yesterday, the association said reporters were called ""rubbish"" and pushed into metal barriers. One photographer was cut by an object thrown by the police, and a large bottle of water carried by a reporter was called an assault weapon in a bag search.
""Reporters at the scene were discharging their duty to record and report, and exercising their coverage right. Police should not take reporters away from the scene and leave their clearance operation free from media supervision,"" the statement said.
Senior superintendent Kong said the force had taken note of the statement and reiterated that they had guidelines to remind officers to assist and not obstruct media coverage.
Asked why officers used flashlights on reporters and searched their belongings, senior superintendent Lee said one possible reason was some protesters were using fake press cards."
South China Morning Post,2019-10-18,Outcry over attack on key protest leader Chief secretary condemns violent assault of prominent right,576 ,"
Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung yesterday condemned a bloody attack on a prominent protest leader as ""totally ­unacceptable"", while the pro- ­democracy bloc slammed it as an attempt to intimidate citizens or even provoke clashes.
Cheung said the government ""attached great attention"" to the attack against Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, who was smashed over the head with hammers and spanners by at least four attackers on Wednesday night in Mong Kok.
""All kinds of violence, no ­matter what the scale, are unacceptable,"" he told a radio show, noting police had said they would bring the culprits to justice.
Sham had been making his way to the annual general meeting of the front, the pro-democracy group he leads, when he was attacked for the second time in the past two months. The front, which is responsible for some of the ­largest peaceful marches in the city, was expected to discuss a protest in Kowloon on Sunday.
Sham was conscious when sent to Kwong Wah Hospital and was understood to be in a stable condition. He was seen in a wheelchair talking to his lawyer yesterday morning.
Writing on Facebook, Sham said his wounds had already been sewn up, and he expressed ­gratitude to his comrades, medical staff and police officers who ­arrived at the scene.
""I am sorry that I have made everyone worried. I will recover soon and continue to insist on our five demands and our beliefs in peaceful, rational and non- ­violent [protests],"" Sham wrote, referring to the protesters' calls which include an independent ­investigation into police actions during the ongoing unrest and the ­implementation of universal ­suffrage.
Speaking after visiting Sham, Eric Lai Yan-ho, the group's deputy convenor, said his ­colleague would have to stay in hospital for recovery.
""His head and joints were ­injured, but he has no fractures,"" Lai said. ""He calls for citizens in Hong Kong as well as police ­officers to allow a safe, lawful and peaceful rally this coming ­Sunday.""
Lai urged the police commissioner to issue a letter of no objection to the march.
He added that Sham had said he could not recognise the faces or the ethnicities of the assailants, after reports that they were South Asian sparked some comments online against that community.
""He asked Hongkongers not to take any actions as revenge against any particular groups of ethnicities or race, because we have to focus on the system, on the violence caused by the ­structure and the systems in Hong Kong,"" Lai said.
Police returned to the scene of the incident yesterday afternoon to find witnesses and retrieve ­surveillance footage.
Leaders of the Muslim ­community condemned the ""barbaric and brutal attack"" on Sham and called it an attempt to divide society.
""Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr Jimmy Sham and we pray for his health and well-being,"" the Incorporated Trustees of the ­Islamic Community Fund of Hong Kong said in a statement.
Pro-democracy lawmakers were up in arms about the attack, which they described as aclear attempt to intimidate ­Hong­kongers.
""The front is the totem in Hong Kong for peaceful protests. This very vicious attack took place practically on the eve of [Sham's] call for yet another peaceful protest in Hong Kong on Sunday,"" Council Front lawmaker Claudia Mo Man-ching said.
""We cannot help feeling that this entire thing is part of a plan to shed blood on Hong Kong's peaceful protests,"" she said.

South China Morning Post,2019-10-15,"Visiting US senator urges protesters to be non-violent Josh Hawley, who observed demonstrations at t",567 ,"
The youngest sitting senator in the United States has urged Hong Kong protesters to be non-violent, as he claimed the city was sliding into a police state at the end of a two-day visit yesterday.
Missouri senate representative Josh Hawley, 39, arrived on Sunday specifically to ­observe the ongoing protests, which have ­become increasingly violent.
""It is important that the pro-democracy protesters continue to be non-violent, that they do not mimic the behaviour of Beijing and [its] supporters,"" he said, adding that he understood people's desire to defend themselves.
He also said the protesters' ""Be Water"" tactic to react swiftly to ­police deployment was fascinating and that the leaderless nature of the movement was remarkable.
Protesters, who have been on the streets for more than four months, on Sunday went on another rampage across the city, attacking police officers, trashing metro stations and vandalising shops with mainland business ties.
Hawley, who was observing a protest in Mong Kok on Sunday, said he did not see any violence first-hand but described the scenes as tense. ""The situation here is urgent, that Hong Kong is in danger of sliding into a police state ... and the 'one country, two systems' model is at risk,"" Hawley said, blaming police for escalating their use of force against protesters. ""It doesn't appear to be happenstance, it doesn't appear to be one or two bent cops, it appears to be the 'company policy', so to speak.""
He said he felt protesters' call for an independent probe into the police force was reasonable.
While he did not provide an estimate on when the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act would be put to a vote in the US Senate, Hawley vowed to continue to advocate for its passage.
Introduced in June by Senator Marco Rubio, the Act, if passed, would require the US government to assess Hong Kong's level of ­human rights and democracy each year to determine whether Washington should continue to grant trade privileges under the US-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992.
Hawley was the third Republican senator to visit the city since the anti-government protests erupted in June, after Ted Cruz and Rick Scott.
Apart from visiting Mong Kok on Sunday, Hawley said he had met a ""wide array"" of individuals including business representatives. Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung confirmed he met Hawley yesterday.
But the senator said he did not seek a meeting with Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, who cancelled a meeting with Cruz on Saturday due to ""other commitments"". ""I think Carrie Lam, certainly in her dealings with Senator Cruz ... has made it clear where she stands,"" Hawley said.
Separately, Professor Francis Chan Ka-leung, dean of Chinese University's faculty of medicine, questioned the government's ­rejection of calls to set up an ­independent probe into police's handling of the protests.
In a Facebook post yesterday, he wrote: ""I will not jump to any conclusion that the police have abused power, and I do not think the Independent Police Complaints Council is incompetent.""
But Chan said he could not ""quite fathom"" why the government could not set up an independent probe while the police watchdog conducted its own.
""We need to bring to justice those who have abused their power, and also need to clear the names of those who have performed their duties conscientiously and dutifully.""

South China Morning Post,2019-09-02,Xinhua tells protesters that 'the end is coming' State media outlet does not threaten specific actio,368 ,"
Communist Party mouthpiece Xinhua yesterday condemnedthe increasingly violent anti-government protests, warning that ""the end is coming for those attempting to disrupt Hong Kong and antagonise China"".
The news agency's commentary did not threaten specific ­action to end the protests, other than repeating support for the Hong Kong government and for police actions.
But the latest in a series of strongly worded statements from Beijing did lay out three bottom lines ""that must not be crossed"".
""No one should harm [China's] national sovereignty and security; no one should challenge the power of the central authorities and the authority of the Basic Law of the [city]; no one should use Hong Kong to infiltrate and undermine the mainland,"" it said.
""Anyone who dares to infringe upon these bottom lines and interfere in or damage the 'one country, two systems' principle will face nothing but failure and will be held accountable by the country's constitution and the [city's] Basic Law.""
The protest violence this weekend was some of the most ­intense since the unrest - sparked by a now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to the mainland for trial - began in early June.
The commentary warned that the protesters would soon face justice.
""Behind the violence and chaos in Hong Kong is an elaborate scheme of the rioters and their patrons whose real intent is clearly exposed now,"" it said.
""They tried to stir up unrest in Hong Kong and compromise the one country, two systems principle, before spreading the 'colour revolution' into the Chinese mainland.
""However, their attempt to kidnap Hong Kong and press the central authorities is just a ­delusion. No concession should be ­expected concerning [this] principle.""
In a commentary a week ago, Xinhua quoted late leader Deng Xiaoping as having said in 1984 that the central government ""should intervene"" in the event of unrest in Hong Kong.
However, it did not repeat the intervention reference in yesterday's commentary.
""Faced with the central government's resolute support for the [city] government and the Hong Kong police ... the end is coming for those attempting to disrupt Hong Kong and antagonise China,"" it added."

Hong Kong's embattled ­judiciary could be forgiven for heaving a sigh of relief when the trial of the Occupy protest leaders reached its conclusion earlier this year. That was the last in a long line of cases arising from the civil disobedience movement which saw streets in Hong Kong occupied for 79 days in 2014. 
The Occupy protests led to more than 1,000 arrests. For five years the courts sought to do justice in politically sensitive cases at a time of deep divisions and high emotions in the city. Judges and ­magistrates came in for fierce criticism from one side or the other for being either too lenient or too harsh. Some received threats as critics unhappy with this or that judgment called into question the ­judiciary's independence.
This extraordinary period for the courts seemed near an end when the Occupy ­leaders were sentenced in April, with four of them jailed. But only a few weeks later, the extradition bill demonstrations began. Now, the judiciary is facing an even bigger challenge.
The Occupy protests pale in comparison with the ongoing anti-government demonstrations. For 15 weeks, Hong Kong has seen mass protests, many leading to violent clashes. Petrol bombs have been hurled, barricades set alight, MTR stations vandalised, and police stations besieged. Police officers have, at times, appeared to use excessive force in breach of the law. And violence flared between pro- and anti-government groups last weekend.
More than 1,300 arrests have been made and the first cases are appearing ­before the courts. At such a sensitive time, the judiciary's role in impartially applying the law must be understood and respected. Support from the government and public confidence in the process are imperative. Already, however, the courts are coming under attack. Last week a pro-government group organised a protest outside the Court of Final Appeal attended by around 100 people. They criticised the judiciary for ­releasing anti-government protesters on bail and imposing what they consider to be lenient sentences.
There were calls for Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma Tao-li to step down. Similarly, anti-government protesters have used social media to target members of the judiciary who have denied bail to their fellow ­followers. Dispensing justice is not a team game. The courts are restrained by the ­requirement that they apply established legal principles.
Whether a defendant is released on bail pending trial depends on whether the court believes it is likely that person will abscond, commit further offences or interfere with witnesses. If not, bail should be granted.
Hong Kong's institutions have taken a battering as a result of the ill-fated bid to pass a law which would have allowed ­people to be sent for trial on the mainland. The government, which has accepted ­responsibility for the crisis, has little ­credibility left despite its belated pledge to withdraw the bill.
The police, thrust onto the front line, are seen by anti-government protesters as the enemy, rather than guardians of the peace. The Legislative Council, which had been expected to pass the bill despite strong ­public concerns, also has much work to do if it is to restore its reputation, especially in the eyes of the young.
With these core institutions weakened, much depends on the judiciary.
The call by Yang Guang, spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, for all Hong Kong institutions with public authority, including the judiciary, to ­prioritise the curbing of turmoil and ­violence will only put more pressure on the courts. It risks creating a public perception that the judges are there to do the ­government's bidding and it could undermine confidence in the independence of the judiciary.
It is not the job of the judges to curb ­turmoil and violence. Their task is to apply the law freely and fairly. This inevitably means some suspects will be acquitted ­because the case against them is not strong enough. Others may receive non-custodial sentences in accordance with established sentencing guidelines. Some, no doubt, will be given heavy sentences. This was precisely what happened when the courts considered the Occupy cases in recent years.
Deterrence is one element of sentencing. The courts have, in the wake of the ­Occupy movement, introduced new ­sentencing guidelines providing tougher penalties for violent protests. They only apply to offences committed after the new guidelines were imposed in August 2017. There will also be mitigating factors for the courts to consider, including the age and circumstances of defendants.
The judicial process has continued to take its course during the protests without any sign of bias. Occupy leader Benny Tai Yiu-ting was released from his jail term on bail last month pending an appeal. A ban on pro-democracy activist Agnes Chow Ting standing for election to the Legislative Council was overturned by a court early this month. Meanwhile, in June, the Court of Final Appeal ruled against the government in a landmark case concerning LGBT rights.
Five police officers jailed for beating a suspect during the Occupy demonstrations saw their convictions upheld, while two others were acquitted. The courts have also recently issued injunctions intended to prevent anti-government protesters ­disrupting operations at the airport and on the MTR.
The chief justice has, in recent years, used his annual speech at the opening of a legal year to call for the judicial process to be respected and for critics of court judgments to at least try to understand how and why the judge concerned arrived at the decision. Judgments are open to criticism. But the politically neutral role of the judiciary means it cannot fight back when under attack. Critics should refrain from launching ill-informed and politically motivated attacks.
One of the five demands made by ­protesters is for an amnesty for those ­involved in the demonstrations. This raises a number of legal issues which would not be easy to overcome. One practical benefit of such a move, though, would be to spare the courts the burden of so many politically sensitive cases.
Hong Kong's rule of law depends on the work of an independent judiciary enjoying a high level of public confidence. This will be under threat if attempts are made to drag the courts into political battles. The government, police and demonstrators on both sides must respect the judicial process. As Hong Kong faces more dissent, division and disorder, the judiciary is one institution that must emerge unscathed.

South China Morning Post,2019-07-21,Rally organisers lose Appeal against shortened route Police express public safety fears as appeal bo,602 ,"
The organisers of today's ­extradition bill march have lost their appeal against the police's decision to shorten the protest route, after the force expressed concerns over public safety amid the escalating violence of recent demonstrations.
An independent appeal board ruled yesterday against the Civil Human Rights Front's bid to overturn the move to end the route at Southorn Playground in Wan Chai. Organisers had initially wanted to march from Victoria Park in Causeway Bay to the Court of Final Appeal in Central.
The shorter route, which still begins at the park, prevents protesters from passing police headquarters in Wan Chai and the government head office and legislature in Admiralty. Both complexes were previously besieged or damaged by protesters.
But the Appeal Board on Public Meetings and Processions upheld the group's request to finish the march, which begins at 3pm, at 23.59pm, dismissing the force's suggestion it end by 9pm. Board chairman Dr Pang Kin-kee said members had considered public order and the protection of people's rights and freedoms before reaching a unanimous decision.
Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, the Front's convenor, complained it would be hard to disperse in Wan Chai, given the book fair was being held at the nearby Convention and Exhibition Centre. He said they would ask protesters to leave as requested, but it was up to police to point out the exit routes.
""If the crowd management is out of control during the march on Sunday, police and the appeal board should bear all responsibilities,"" he said.
He added that a group of no more than 30 people planned to carry a banner to their intended end point in Central.
During the hearing, Jim Ng Lok-chun, senior superintendent for operations on Hong Kong Island region, said changing the end point to Wan Chai was necessary. He cited the fact that government buildings and police headquarters had been targeted in protests in the past month, and noted the escalating level of violence in recent demonstrators.
""We are not afraid of marchers entering [the risky spots],"" he said. ""We are afraid some radical people might be already at those sites, and the peaceful protesters could enter there.""
Chief Superintendent John Tse Chun-chung, of the Police Public Relations Bureau, said officers noticed internet users had advocated the use of weapons during the rally, and to march from the approved routes.
The foiling of the city's largest-ever bomb plot on the eve of march had deepened concerns, Tse added, saying the change of route was not a suppression and was needed to minimise risks.
""Speaking from our experience from the last few weeks, protesters had gone from shouting slogans to blocking roads, and some even damaged public properties and shops. They attacked citizens and officers,"" he said.
""As a consequence, we are concerned about the way the procession will be conducted.""
The force also said it did not see the need to suspend the book fair, and would help protesters leave the district.
Authorities have increased security around government and police headquarters, which have been locked down and barricaded by two-metre-high water barriers.
Government sources said nearly 4,000 police officers had been mobilised to ""prepare for the worst"". They stressed the force considered the safety of officers to be a top priority as management looked to avoid a repeat of clashes last week, when 13 ­police officers were among the 28 casualties.
Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Jockey Club has decided to temporarily close four off-course betting branches in Wan Chai and Central on Sunday as a result of the planned protest.

South China Morning Post,2019-07-15,Media rally against police mistreatment Journalists hold silent march demanding Carrie Lam defend pr,740 ,"
More than a thousand journalists switched roles ­yesterday to stagea silent march against whatthey called police mistreatmentof frontline reporters and ­infringements of press freedom during ­extradition bill protests.
Journalists and their supporters dressed in black marched ­behind a banner, reading ""stop police violence, defend press freedom"", to demand officers ­followed rules under the police general orders and warn them against obstructing journalists from doing their job.
Organisers said more than 1,500 attended the rally, which went from Admiralty to police headquarters in Wan Chai. The police estimate was 1,100 in attendance at the event's peak.
They then marched to the Chief Executive's Office, calling on Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to defend press freedom as promised in her election platform.
""Time and again, journalists have been struggling to keep themselves safe [during protests]. The irony is the major source of threats came from police officers [at the scene],"" said Chris Yeung Kin-hing, chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA), which co-organised the march with six other groups.
""How can the media serve the role of the fourth estate, especially in monitoring [those who hold power]?
A police spokesman said the force had been maintaining communication with media organisations so that both sides could have mutual understanding. He added the number of public events in June were unprecedented and there was room for ­improvement in the coordination between ­police and the media.
Police also said they would ­enhance relevant training for their officers.
Regarding cases in which ­media practitioners alleged they were treated unreasonably while carrying out their duties, police said they would take appropriate follow-up ­action.
The silent march came after a series of anti-bill protests over the past month had rocked the city, soured relations between police and the public and left dozens ­injured.
At least four reporters covering the clashes in Sheung Shui on ­Saturday were hit or pushed by police officers with batons and shields despite clearly identifying themselves, the HKJA said.
As they reached police headquarters, march organisers read out accounts of how frontline ­reporters had been attacked by police during protests.
The journalists also held up their press passes outside police headquarters in protest against reports that officers had repeatedly failed to display their warrant cards during operations to clear protesters.
Critics alleged it was a deliberate ploy to make it harder for ­protesters to submit complaints against police.
The march was attended by current, former and aspiring ­journalists as well as lecturers, with some holding placards reading ""not your friends, nor your enemies"".
""Our demands today are really simple. We want the police to exercise control when [dealing] with reporters during protests,"" said Chris Leung Chi-hong, a 27-year-old reporter and council member of the Ming Pao Staff ­Association.
Leung, who had been on the front line covering the protests, said he had seen colleagues being pushed and pepper sprayed.
Sally Leung, a retired chief librarian at now-defunct broadcaster ATV, showed up to lend her support. ""The government needs to ­address this problem,"" she said.
Nigel Lee Ka-Wai, a 23-year-old reporter for online news outlet HK01, said he had witnessed the animosity between police and ­reporters as he covered the Sheung Shui protest on Saturday.
""Some of the officers, who are usually communications officers, threatened reporters with batons,"" he said.
The HKJA's Yeung also criticised Lam for attending functions without giving media notice on several occasions recently.
""They have caused concerns that the government is trying to avoid journalists by resorting to one-way dissemination of information, seeking to turn reporters into mouthpieces,"" he said.
The police had also issued press releases and videos on the protests instead of meeting the press, Yeung said, which he ­suspected was an attempt to ­control the narrative.
Meanwhile, a fund was set up by the HKJA to assist reporters in seeking justice through legal means if they were injured in the line of work.
Other co-organisers of the march were the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association, Independent Commentators Association, Journalism Educators for Press Freedom, Ming Pao Staff ­Association, Next Media Trade Union and RTHK Programme Staff Union.

The heart of Hong Kong's ­business district was turned into a war zone last night as riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets into crowds of protesters to chase them off the streets, after a day of defiance that saw them lay siege to Beijing's liaison office for the first time in the social unrest over the now-suspended extradition bill.
After another massive anti-government march from Causeway Bay to Wan Chai in the afternoon broke up into rolling waves of protests that spread to Admiralty, Central and Sheung Wan, the main road outside the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry ­Terminal was the tear smoke-filled battleground for late-night clashes between heavily geared riot ­police and masked and ­helmeted youths in black.
Nearly two hours after police warned they would move in to clear the roads, fully equipped ­officers from the elite Special ­Tactical Squad let loose with tear gas and rubber bullets, while protesters fought back or counter-attacked with bottles, bricks, poles and umbrellas.
""We have nothing to lose now, I am not afraid,"" one of them shouted, while fires lit by protesters burned at the barricades they set up.
The government issued a late-night statement to strongly condemn protesters for deviating from their mandated march route and challenging Beijing's sovereignty by besieging the liaison ­office building, where they ­vandalised the national emblem.
While the government vowed to investigate the attack, the ­liaison office followed up with a statement saying while it respected those who expressed their views peacefully, otherwise peaceful marches had repeatedly ended in unlawful demonstrations, with protesters charging police cordons, laying siege to ­police headquarters and occupying roads.
It also recapped how, a day earlier, authorities seized what was billed as the largest amount of the deadliest explosives ever uncovered in the city, along with pro-independence materials, from a home-made laboratory in a Tsuen Wan industrial building.
""The [local] government is worried that a small group of radical protesters are plotting to incite the public to break the law and even storm the central government's offices in Hong Kong,"" the office said. ""Such a move will threaten the security of Hong Kong and pose a threat to 'one country, two systems'. Society will not accept this.""
That was after masked protesters threw eggs at the front of the liaison office building in Sai Ying Pun, the symbol of Beijing's presence in the city, spray-painted ­obscenities on the walls, blackened security cameras and shone lasers at staff trapped inside, before they retreated when warned that the riot squad would move in to clear the area.
Hundreds of thousands joined the peaceful main march from Victoria Park in Causeway Bay to Southorn Playground in Wan Chai, but many splintered off in different directions at about5.30pm, going well beyond the mandated end point.
Large groups advanced to Central, heading for the Court of Final Appeal, occupying Harcourt Road in Admiralty, bringing traffic to a chaotic halt, and later blocking major arteries Connaught Road Central and Connaught Road West.
They also took over Des Voeux Road Central and ­Pedder Street, among others, many of them taking the protest all the way down Connaught Road Central to the terminal.
Earlier, brawls broke out between protesters and drivers, one of whom was beaten up when he tried to take them on, arguing they had no right to block his vehicle.
A group of protesters assaulted him with fists, feet and umbrellas, while others attacked his van, smashing its windows.
""You can play and do whatever you want, but don't do this to me,"" he said, pleading that his vehicle was his livelihood, after some protesters pulled him away from the angry crowd.
Hundreds had earlier laid siege to police headquarters in Wan Chai again, this time with the building protected by massive water barricades that protesters turned into another Lennon Wall of Post-it notes criticising law ­enforcers. They also hurled abuse at officers monitoring them from inside and flashed lasers at them.
Protesters also attacked the Central Police Station with bricks and spray-painted obscenities on the walls.
The violence came after hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets again in a third massive march against the extradition bill and the city's embattled government, amid tightened ­security measures by police over fears of escalating violence.
The original destination of the march was the Court of Final Appeal in Central. Organiser Civil Human Rights Front had lost its appeal a day earlier against police, who wanted to shorten the route for safety reasons.
Leading the procession were Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, lawmakers Helena Wong Pik-wan and Gary Fan Kwok-wai, singer Denise Ho Wan-sze, and media mogul Jimmy Lai Chee-ying.
""Since March 31, time and time again Hongkongers have pounded the streets. Not just with rallies and protests. Now we see Lennon Walls blossoming across the city. Our five demands are crystal clear,"" Sham said.
The front held two massive peaceful marches on June 9 and 16, drawing an estimated 1 million and 2 million people, ­respectively.
The theme of yesterday's march centred on demands made by protesters, among which is the setting up of an independent commission of inquiry to look into complaints of police ­brutality. Over the past weeks, protesters and police have clashed in running battles after marches, resulting in casualties and arrests.
In a separate outbreak of late-night violence, scores of men in white shirts stormed into Yuen Long MTR station and attacked passengers with rods, witnesses said.
Multiple injuries were ­reported as people on the concourse, ­including opposition lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting, were also indiscriminately attacked. ­Reporters at the scene were also assaulted.
At about 11pm, the MTR ­announced that trains running on the West Rail Line would not stop at the station. Police arrived at the scene half an hour later.

South China Morning Post,2019-09-30,Protesters vent fury at Festival Walk,476 ,"
An upmarket shopping centre in Kowloon became part of the ­turmoil yesterday with anti-government protesters targeting stores and shops with ties to local catering giant ­Maxim's.
Hundreds of demonstrators, most wearing masks and dressed in black, took over Festival Walk mall in Kowloon Tong in the afternoon. Some vandalised ordering machines, wrecked reservation equipment and shouted abuse at customers in eateries owned by the Maxim's Group, which protesters now see as an enemy of their movement.
A ""singing protest"" first took place at the atrium of the mall, before the demonstrators marched around the shopping complex, harassing customers.
They were angry at Maxim's because Annie Wu Suk-ching, the daughter of the conglomerate's founder James Wu Tak, defended the Hong Kong government recently at the United Nations Human Rights Council.
She stood up for the government's handling of the protests triggered by the now-shelved extradition bill and condemned radical protesters for being unlawful.
A 20-year-old protester who declined to be named said: ""Even if Annie Wu apologised, it's too late now. She angered a lot of people and she's against us.""
An estimated 60 black-clad protesters stormed the Cova Caffe, which is a Maxim's franchise, chanting: ""If you eat at Maxim's, you have lost your conscience."" The protest was mostly non-violent, although a man claimed he was punched and sprayed with black paint by a protester because he criticised their action.
""Hong Kong was not like this before,"" the man said. ""Now they have messed up Hong Kong, making everyone's life very difficult.""
Another customer, surnamed Yip, was having an afternoon snack with his family at the food court when the protesters arrived. ""We were aware that the mall might close. It is all right because we think the demands of the protesters are reasonable,"" he said.
Yip said he had planned to join the march in Causeway Bay but changed his mind after seeing the violent clashes.
Maxim's outlets in New Town Plaza in Sha Tin were targeted by protesters last week, prompting Maxim to issue a statement, saying, Wu did not hold any position at the company and was not involved in managerial decisions.
Festival Walk was spared serious vandalism yesterday. Protesters did, however, smash the touch screen ordering machines at the McDonald's branch. Other protesters plastered notes on the front of shops owned by Maxim's, denouncing the business.
The protesters kicked off their ""shopping tour"" around lunchtime. Hundreds marched around the mall, chanting slogans such as ""liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times"". Some were sarcastic: ""We are only here shopping.""
For six hours, they chanted slogans and sang songs such as Glory to Hong Kong. Also, a trio playing the saxophone clarinet and a flute offered a rendition of the American national anthem, The Star Spangled Banner."
South China Morning Post,2019-07-17,protests seen hitting Tourism and sales Separate warnings by HSBC and retail association follow rece,552 ,"
The massive extradition bill ­protests that have rattled the city in recent weeks will put hundreds of thousands of mainland tourists off visiting Hong Kong this year, according to HSBC.
The warning came as the retail sector was bracing itself for a ­double-digit ­decline year on year over the ­summer holiday following violent clashes in two shopping districts last weekend.
The Hong Kong Retail Management Association said most of its over 8,000 member shops had recorded a drop in revenues last month and the first week of July on average, with some posting a fall by double digits.
It said July and August were the traditional high seasons for the ­industry and its members made such a forecast as the massive protests spread to various districts.
""If the situation continues, the association will revise the forecast on overall sales in 2019 to a ­double-digit decline,"" the association said, pointing to a sharp downgrade from its earlier annual forecast of single-digit growth.
HSBC meanwhile believed the number of visitors from the mainland would continue to grow in 2019, but at a slightly slower rate than it had forecast before the protests.
It revised down its estimated growth of mainland tourist arrivals for the year to 9 per cent from 9.7 per cent, according to a report released yesterday.
The initial forecast would have equated to 56 million mainland tourists. That means, according to the revised figure, Hong Kong will welcome 350,000 fewer visitors from the mainland this year.
""We have trimmed our estimates to 9 per cent for the year given the recent protests, which could affect tourism flows,"" said Erwan Rambourg, HSBC's global co-head of consumer and retail research, in the report.
Over the weekend, clashes between police and protesters rocked Sha Tin and Sheung Shui - shopping districts popular among mainland tourists. Protesters were there to demand the complete withdrawal of the now-suspended bill that would have resulted in the transfer of fugitives from the city to jurisdictions with which it lacks such an arrangement, including the mainland.
On Sunday, shocking images of bloodied faces, head wounds, a police officer viciously assaulted by youths and protesters pepper-sprayed and beaten with batons emerged - painting a stark contrast to the peaceful march that had taken place earlier in the day.
The association said the protests had led to suspension of business in the shops and also affected the income of retail workers. ""The industry worries the incident will dent Hong Kong's international image as a safe city, a food and shopping paradise.""
But the forecasts by two other analysts were not that pessimistic. Andy Kwan Cheuk-chiu, director of the ACE Centre for Business and Economic Research, said it was unlikely the retail sector would record a double-digit fall in sales in July and August because the protests only happened in certain districts and shoppers knew where to go. ""It's not a city-wide protest,"" he said.
Mariana Kou Chung-yin, head of China education and Hong Kong consumer research for CLSA, predicted a single-digit ­decline for July and August from the same months last year, but added that this would depend on how the situation unfolded.
Retail sales fell for the fourth straight month in May, with a 1.3 per cent drop to HK$40 billion year on year."

Two Hong Kong businesswomen are expected to defend the government's handling of protests when the UN's top human rights body meets in Geneva this week.
Macau casino heiress Pansy Ho Chiu-king and Annie Wu Suk-ching, daughter of catering group Maxim's founder James Tak Wu, will speak at the United Nations Human Rights Council on ­Tuesday.
It comes as Beijing is ramping up efforts to sway global opinion on the months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong.
The pair will give a speech on behalf of the Hong Kong Federation of Women, a pro-government organisation.
""The views of a small group of radical protesters do not represent the views of all 7.5 million Hongkongers. The systematic and calculated violent acts of this group have never been condoned by all Hongkongers,"" they will say, according to a copy of the speech posted on the website of the UN Human Rights Council.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor announced on Wednesday that she would withdraw the extradition bill that triggered the protests in early June.
In the speech, Ho describes the bill as ""well-intended"" but says it was ""hijacked"" by radicals who have used it as ""propaganda to undermine the Hong Kong government's authority to protect the right of one of its citizens even in her death"". She was referring to a case in which Taiwanese authorities were unable to prosecute a Hongkonger accused of killing his girlfriend in Taipei before he fled to Hong Kong.
Ho says the protests have had a ""damaging impact"" on Hong Kong's economy and livelihoods. And she defends ­the use of tear gas and rubber bullets as ""an effective way to create a distance between the police and protesters, and to avoid close physical confrontation and resulting injuries"".
Ho, co-chairwoman and executive director of casino operator MGM China Holdings, is also a standing committee member of Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the top advisory body. Wu, founder of the first mainland-Hong Kong joint venture, Beijing Air Catering, is a standing committee member at national level.
Hong Kong-based China analyst Johnny Lau Yui-siu said the speech was in line with the central government's recent propaganda efforts.
""China has not been able to gain the upper hand in global opinion on Hong Kong despite having a huge propaganda machine and access to various international platforms,"" Lau said. ""Despite that, Beijing is still eager to fight the [propaganda] war.""
Beijing has escalated its rhetoric against the Hong Kong protesters through both state media and social media. The foreign ministry sent letters to dozens of foreign media outlets in August calling for ""impartial"" and ""objective"" reporting on the protests.
But the efforts to expand the propaganda campaign overseas have backfired at times. Facebook and Twitter last month took action against what they said was coordinated efforts by the central government and those associated with it to spread disinformation about the protests in Hong Kong.
Yik Chan Chin, an assistant professor at Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou, said Beijing's propaganda drive was not likely to gain much global support. ""The perception has already been formed,"" she said.
On Friday, Chen Xu, China's envoy to UN institutions in Geneva, said Beijing was ready for any ""undesirable or uninvited rhetoric"" on issues like the Hong Kong unrest or the treatment of Uygurs in Xinjiang when the UN human rights body meets for three weeks starting tomorrow, according to Associated Press.
Meanwhile at a Mid-Autumn Festival celebration in Washington, ambassador to the US Cui ­Tiankai reiterated that Hong Kong was facing its gravest situation since the handover from Britain to China 22 years ago, and that Beijing would not allow any conspiracy to split the country to succeed."

Their faces wrapped in masks and T-shirts turned home-made ­balaclavas, eyes protected by ­goggles and arms covered in cling film, the hordes stood at the ­junction of Harcourt Road and Tim Wa Avenue, waiting for their cue.
""Advance now!"" one young man standing on the metal barricades separating them from ­police shouted into a megaphone. Immediately, the protesters pushed forward, counting ""one, two; one, two"" almost in lockstep.
It was after 3.30pm but energy levels remained high. Many in the crowd had camped overnight to prepare for the day of reckoning - some said mourning, pointing to their funereal white and black outfits - as they tried to surround the legislature and block all roads leading to it.
Their singular mission: vent their anger against the extradition bill that they said would mark the death of Hong Kong.
While the morning began peacefully, both sides grew restive as the afternoon wore on. When police began firing tear gas and rubber bullets as the protesters surged forth, the ­response was calm, as if the youngsters knew ­instinctively what to do. Makeshift first aid stations popped up, towels were whipped out and volunteers went around giving saline to those who had their eyes burnt by the tear gas and pepper spray.
Earlier, the spirit of camaraderie among many who said they did not know those in the crowd beyond their immediate circle of friends was palpable. Someone shouted: ""Anyone has asthma medication?"" and the plea was repeated and echoed one by one throughout their ranks. Aid came within minutes, and with applause from the appreciative crowd.
""In the absence of a leader, we all hope to go the extra mile and be more devoted in our protest,"" ­23-year-old Bevis Lo said.
""Scrap it! Scrap it!"" the protesters shouting, chanting these slogans on and off, and clapped in rhythm to keep the atmosphere upbeat. ""No retreat if it's not scrapped!""
In scenes reminiscent of the Occupy days in 2014, one ­conspicuous difference from five years ago was the near absence of obvious leaders in the crowd. If egalitarianism had found a home in Hong Kong, it was in the spirit of the young protesters.
It also appeared to be a lesson the young protesters had learned from Occupy, a new tolerance ­towards different views and ­different camps, the protesters told the Post repeatedly.
""We all share the same goal, but sometimes we might have done something that others do not totally agree with - such as how and where to place the ­barricades,"" said a 24-year old ­student managing a first aid ­station who only wanted to be identified as R.
""This tolerance is definitely what we learned from the past experience.""
And unlike five years ago, the protesters - a majority of whom seem to be in their early 20s - were noticeably more leery of cameras.
They repeatedly reminded each other to put on face masks ""to protect themselves"", reluctant to have their pictures taken, or have their identity revealed while being interviewed.
Over the past week in the lead-up to the protests, tens of thousands of Hongkongers exchanged tactics on how to block lawmakers from scrutinising the extradition bill through several encrypted channels on Telegram.
Harcourt Road and Lung Wo Road were successfully taken over at about 8am by protesters with barricades, while at least six ­private cars blocked Queensway by intentionally stopping in ­different locations - strategies executed smoothly after being discussed in encrypted channels.
Protesters also appeared to have clear understanding of ­division of labour. At least one person would always be spotted standing on a barricade at each junction to monitor the police, as others ran supply booths and manned first aid stations.
""There are some hiccups at the very beginning but we soon knew how to play our own roles,"" Lo said.
After the Occupy protests of 2014, the movement soon splintered. Acrimony, leadership ­tussles and blame games ensued while others grew cynical about the effectiveness of civil disobedience to fight for democracy.
But a 31-year-old freelancer, who only gave her name as NC, said the lack of a clear leader or ­organiser this time actually ­allowed people from a broader swathe of society to make ­common cause again.
The Civil Human Rights Front - which organised Sunday's march - studiously avoided ­taking the lead in the protests. Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, the front's convenor, thanked Hongkongers for taking action, even without a ­central organiser.
Occupy student leader ­Nathan Law Kwun-chung said it would only be reasonable for the young protesters to protect themselves from being identified.
""A lot of them have lost their confidence over the judicial ­system of Hong Kong,"" he said.
Jas, a 24-year-old nursing ­student, said she took the day off to stand as one with the protesters for this very reason.
""I do not know whether this would make a difference or not,"" she said. ""I only know that if I do not resist now, there might not be a second chance in future.""
Yesterday was her birthday. The party had to wait, she said, ­because the protest could not."
South China Morning Post,2019-11-16,"Churches on front line Amid the social unrest, pastors can be found in the most heated situations ap",1698 ,"
For Reverend Yeung Kwan, ­Sunday usually means putting on his clerical collar, preaching at services, teaching Sunday school and, sometimes, seeing those who need marriage counselling.
But for the past five months, the senior pastor of the Hong Kong Reformed Presbyterian Hon Wah Covenant Church in Tsuen Wan has done considerably more.
On Sunday afternoons, the 50-year-old swaps his collar for a frontline photographer's vest, packs his camera, goggles and breathing mask and sets off for flashpoints where intense clashes between police and anti-government protesters are taking place.
He has been at the scene of protests almost every weekend, capturing images for media ­outlets and a Facebook page he set up recently with other ­Christian photographers.
""Keeping a record is so important,"" says Yeung, one of the few photographers who took pictures of a woman hit in the eye by a projectile on August 11, in an incident which sparked a furore over ­alleged police brutality.
There were about 884,000 Protestants and Catholics in 2016, according to government ­estimates, or about 12 per cent of the city's population.
Their presence has been ­unmistakable at the ongoing protests, now in their sixth month.
Some church workers, with helmets and vests bearing the word ""Pastors"", have appeared regularly at the front line, as they try to be a buffer between police and protesters. This is a sight not seen in the 2014 Occupy protests.
The pastors have been seen speaking to protesters and ­officers, appealing for calm. Some remain on standby to help passers-by, such as elderly people trying to find their way home when public transport is disrupted.
Many religious leaders also attend peaceful protests in their personal capacity.
From as early as May, many churches and Christian organisations appealed to the government to withdraw the extradition bill which triggered the protests over fears it would result in fugitives being sent to the mainland, which is among jurisdictions the city has no exchange arrangement with.
The Baptist Convention issued a rare statement condemning the bill in June, and followed up with a second calling it ""evil in nature"". Many Christians involved in spreading the faith were concerned that the bill threatened their mainland missionary work.
The bill was formally withdrawn last month.
The Christian presence at the protests was evident right from June, when demonstrations against the bill began peacefully.
Protestants and Catholics alike were seen leading the crowds in singing the hymn Sing Hallelujah to the Lord, which for a while was an anthem of the ­movement and seemed to have a pacifying effect on the protesters and police.
The hymn-singing faded out as the protests turned increasingly violent and police responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets and using other crowd-dispersal methods. A new, secular anthem, Glory to Hong Kong, filled the air, along with the chant: ""Five demands, not one less!""
Although the bill was withdrawn, the protesters have four other demands: calling for a commission of inquiry to look into allegations of police brutality; an end to referring to protesters as rioters; amnesty for all protesters who have been arrested; and ­universal suffrage.
Christians have remained ­involved, but many church leaders and members of their flock - including those who support peaceful rallies - are disturbed by the escalating violence.
There is an ongoing debate, including over the WhatsApp messaging app, between Christians who support the protesters and those who question whether it is right to tolerate vandalism and violence by radicals.
After more than a century of providing the city with religious, educational, medical and social services, churches find themselves grappling with defining their role in politics.
Some disenchanted young Christians are said to have stopped attending churches that are reluctant to discuss politics. Churches that sympathise with protesters, as well as those who support the authorities and police, have lost members too.
The increasing violence has affected pastors and those who have been going to the protests, hoping to be peacemakers.
Reverend Wong Siu-yung, 45, pastor-in-charge of the Church of Livingstones in Mong Kok, recalls events on July 21, when he was leading a team of pastors near where protesters had gathered outside Beijing's liaison office. His group tried to get ­people to stay calm, but did not succeed for long.
""It became clear that it was not realistic, because we could only delay the clashes for less than 30 minutes,"" Wong says. ""Pastors were getting hurt too.""
He stopped leading the group after that, although he continues to go on his own to speak to those at the front line.
Some of the other pastors went on to join Protect the Children, a group of social workers, church workers and elderly people who go to protest venues and try to stay between police and young demonstrators.
One issue centres on whether churches should shelter protesters fleeing from police, a topic that has left Christians divided.
Those who support the idea believe it is a way for Christians to put their faith into action by being ""good Samaritans"", while those against say they do not want churches ""shielding rioters"".
According to Reverend Kwok Man-chee, 60, the debate has become common among church workers. The chairman of the Evangelical Free Church of China, which has 35,000 members and runs more than 50 churches, a college, hospital and seminary, says: ""I have been personally involved in resolving disputes.""
Some churches which have taken in protesters, including the Chinese Methodist Church, have been criticised by mainland media for sheltering ""violent rioters"".
Church of Livingstones pastor Wong says there used to be a list on social media informing protesters of churches providing ""rest stations"", but it is no longer available. ""But does that mean the number of churches that open their doors is smaller? I don't think that is the case,"" he says.
On November 11, the Catholic Church found itself in a spot when police entered the Holy Cross Church in Sai Wan Ho, to arrest protesters taking shelter after ­violent clashes in the area.
The Catholic diocese of Hong Kong, which oversees 40 churches, 33 chapels and 27 halls, issued a statement expressing regret about the incident, and said unlike in the past, its churches could no longer protect people who seek refuge.
The city's churches have traditionally kept out of the political arena, focusing instead on serving religious and social needs.
Protestant churches run three tertiary colleges, seven hospitals, 180 middle schools, 199 primary schools and 260 kindergartens while the Catholics operate 248 schools and six hospitals, according to the 2017 Hong Kong yearbook and the Catholic diocese website respectively.
Churches have been criticised, especially by non-believers and young people, for being out of touch with politics and society. The debate over church, politics and whether to support civil ­disobedience was stirred by 2014's Occupy movement.
Several leaders of the movement, ­including pro-democracy activists Joshua Wong Chi-fung, Benny Tai Yiu-ting and Chan Kin-man as well as retired pastor Chu ­Yiu-ming, are Christians, ­although their involvement was not related to the churches they attend.
""Society has changed. People are getting richer and they don't just want services. They want to build a fair and righteous society, and this is particularly what the young generation wants,"" says Reverend Yuen Tin-yau, 68, former president of the Methodist Church and former chairman of the Hong Kong Christian Council.
""But Hong Kong churches respond to this aspect very slowly - they don't know what to do.""
Reverend Lo Hing-choi, president of the Baptist Convention, which has 80,000 members in the city, says Christians began to hold forums exploring the relations ­between churches and politics in recent years.
In September, he met Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng ­Yuet-ngor with leaders of two other major protestant groups, the Evangelical Free Church and the Christian and Missionary Alliance Church. Lo says he told Lam, who is Catholic, he was concerned about what he called the excessive use of force by police.
""Many people said: 'Why don't you condemn the young people also?' My answer is, let's first set up an independent commission to find out the causes of their actions,"" he says.
""We have to understand the reasons. Just saying they are wrong will not solve the problem.""
But others in the Christian fold feel churches should take a stronger position against violence.
Pastor Andrew Ho Po-sang, 62, executive director of Elim Development, which runs Christian bookstores and a publishing company, says he loves young people, but pastors need to tell them violence will not achieve anything, and nor will political systems like democracy solve all problems.
""The heart of the matter is the matter of the heart, not political systems,"" he says, explaining that it is more important to change people, rather than the system.
Pastor and photographer Yeung, meanwhile, has set up a Facebook page featuring photos from the protests by a group of Christian and pastor photographers. The page, White Night, has more than 12,000 followers.
""The fourth estate is so important. Without it, Hong Kong will be in a chilly winter,"" Yeung says.
While he and other Christians have made their presence felt in the protests, other Christian leaders say the churches have been passive in responding to the crisis.
""I don't see anything showing Hong Kong churches leading the movement,"" says Kwok, of the Evangelical Free Church.
The important role of churches is to give hope to Hong Kong, he says, recalling a rare scene he ­witnessed which moved him.
""A young couple who are teachers in high schools came to talk to me after Sunday service,"" he says. ""They were so heartbroken after seeing students being beaten by police. At that very ­moment, a senior police officer and his wife, who were in the congregation, happened to pass by, so I invited them to pray together. As we prayed, we all wept.
""That is what churches should be,"" he said. ""It is not about trying to convince you with my political views."""
South China Morning Post,2019-08-09,"Don't enter unless crime occurs, mall owner tells police Protesters call off plan to swarm one of Wh",546 ,"
The owner of several major ­shopping centres has asked police not to enter its malls unless a crime has taken place, after ­anti-government protesters threatened to disrupt businesses at one location.
Wharf Real Estate Investment Company's (Reic) decision partly prompted protesters yesterday to call off a plan to swarm the ­Harbour City centre it manages in Tsim Sha Tsui.
The move came after another developer faced a backlash earlier for allegedly mishandling clashes between protesters and the force at one of its properties.
Organisers had wanted to stage protests to force major firms to support their demands for the full withdrawal of the now-suspended extradition bill, and the ­setting up of an independent commission of inquiry to investigate the police's handling of the ongoing demonstrations.
Notices placed at Harbour City and other locations managed by Wharf Reic, including Times Square in Causeway Bay and ­Plaza Hollywood in Diamond Hill, read: ""We will do our best to ­ensure customers' safety in the mall. Police, please do not enter unless crimes happen.""
Protesters had removed the Chinese national flag from a ­pole outside Harbour City near the Star Ferry Pier and thrown it into the sea twice last weekend. The area where the pole stands is also managed by the property company.
In a press briefing yesterday to announce the interim 2019 results of Wharf (Holdings), Stephen Ng Tin-hoi, the chairman and managing director of both companies, dodged questions on whether there were plans to protect the flag.
But Ng said the notices had been put up to ensure everyone's safety in the shopping centres.
""We see some things happening in some places,"" he said. ""We think we need to protect people who come here as patrons or workers. We need to be responsible for their safety. For everything else, it will be done in accordance with Hong Kong's law.""
Doreen Lee Yuk-fong, Wharf Reic's vice chairwoman, said on Tuesday that police intervention should be avoided if possible.
Hours after Harbour City put up the notices, protesters ­announced online at around 12.30am yesterday their planned ""Summer Happy Hour"" protest in the evening would be cancelled.
They said the decision was made after listening to the views of online activists, who said a protest might have an adverse effect, and they should target the New Town Plaza in Sha Tin instead.
""Apart from accepting your suggestions, the event has been cancelled because Harbour City has made clear its stance on how to handle police,"" organisers said.
The Sha Tin mall is owned by Sun Hung Kai Properties (SHKP), and its management was accused by protesters of allowing police to enter the mall to arrest demonstrators last month. The operation ended in clashes that injured at least 22 people.
Hundreds of residents later besieged the mall's customer ­service centre to demand an ­explanation, despite SHKP ­insisting it did not call police, and was unaware of their deployment and subsequent dispersal operation on its premises.
The Post has reached out to police for comment on the Wharf Reic notices.
SHKP said it would adopt measures to safeguard shop ­employees and customers, ­including using text messages to notify outlets about the latest ­situation at the malls and revising its emergency response system."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-07,"1,000 rounds fired during day of chaos Police used tear gas, rubber bullets and other non-lethal amm",902 ,"
Hong Kong police fired nearly 1,000 rounds of ammunition during the chaos that gripped the city on Monday, almost equalling the total amount used over the past two months.
Revealing the figures yesterday, police said protests had escalated into an organised attempt to destroy the city, echoing comments made by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor in her Monday press conference.
Officers also arrested 148 people - 95 men and 53 women - during the protests that day for various crimes including unlawful assembly and assaulting police officers, with the youngest aged only 13.
After calling a citywide strike aimed at crippling traffic and business on Monday, protesters gathered on the streets and besieged police stations in at least 10 districts throughout the day.
They were seen setting fires and throwing bricks, stones and petrol bombs at police stations. One police vehicle parked inside a complex was hit by a petrol bomb and set on fire.
Senior Superintendent Kong Wing-cheung of the police public relations bureau said a total of 21 police stations had been vandalised by protesters.
He said officers fired more than 800 rounds of tear gas, 140 rubber bullets and 20 sponge-tipped rounds in at least 10 areas including Admiralty, Tsim Sha Tsui and Wong Tai Sin. In June and July, police fired 1,000 rounds of tear gas, 160 rubber bullets and 150 sponge-tipped rounds.
""We saw a practical need on this. The violence, its frequency and extensiveness has been escalating,"" Kong said. ""The number of violent incidents on Monday exceeded those that took place in the whole of June.""
He added that seven officers had been injured as protesters threw bricks and shot metal balls with catapults.
Police also deployed two purpose-built anti-riot armoured vehicles for the time on Monday to handle conflicts in Mong Kok. The Mercedes-Benz Unimog U5000 armoured vehicles, bought in 2010, are equipped with a powerful sonic capability and its exterior can be electrified to shock anyone who touched it.
Kong said the trucks were a defensive tool for transporting officers and gear and removing obstacles from roads.
Chief Superintendent John Tse ­Chun-chung said the initial peaceful protests had evolved into ""organised events to destroy Hong Kong"".
He said reasonable force was needed to restore law and order across the city, and dismissed claims officers had taken out their anger on protesters and reporters by using excessive force to subdue them.
""It takes two to tango. Both police and the public have a role to play in restoring Hong Kong's safety and stability,"" he said, when asked how officers could still function if they were seen as the enemy.
""Definitely our officers do not show the [same anger as] the rioters,"" he said. ""In fact, we take care of their behaviour. We have psychologists talk with them whenever they are not working, to make sure they are calm enough to carry out their duties.""
He said a small number of officers had been removed from the front line after being verbally and physically abused during clashes between police and members of the public.
Tse also apologised to the media if any reporters had been injured in recent protests. Before the press conference began, an executive committee member of the Journalists Association read out a statement condemning the police for abuse of power and mistreating reporters.
At a separate press conference yesterday, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said the government's top task was to restore harmony in the city.
""The pressing issue is to restore law and order,"" he said. ""We must have law and order before we can look at how Hong Kong should move forward.""
Security minister John Lee Ka-chiu called for protesters to stop using violence.
""If the police are not attacked, or if any public meetings are orderly and peaceful, then there is actually no need for police to take any enforcement action,"" Lee said.
Lee also called the recent protests the ""most widespread, most damaging and most serious"" since Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule in 1997.
Cheng Sui-on, who leads the Fire Services Department, said firefighters were dispatched to 21 cases of arson on Monday.
Candy Kwok Wai-ying, assistant commissioner of transport, said 200 sets of traffic lights were damaged, with more than 70 still out of service yesterday.
Kwok said the outages were concentrated on main roads in various areas, such as Hennessy Road, Nathan Road and the Tsuen Wan section of Castle Peak Road. Workers had been sent to fix the lights, Kwok said, urging motorists to be careful.
Meanwhile, in a joint statement yesterday, the groups Civil Rights Observer, Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor and Amnesty International Hong Kong urged police not to deploy water cannon trucks or armoured vehicles against protesters. They said the public were unfamiliar with the new vehicles, which could intensify emotions.
The groups also accused the police of abusing the use of tear gas, and said officers should not actively attack protesters and should consider the impact of their actions on local neighbourhoods.
On protest violence, Civil Rights Observer spokesman Wong Ho yin said: ""It is a vicious circle, because the government didn't heed [protesters] views but sends police to suppress them.
""Then the protesters step up action and then the police use more force. The police should exercise restraint in the first place.""

South China Morning Post,2019-08-02,cheng 'fast-tracked riot charges' Legal sources say justice minister took firmer line to deter other,1007 ,"
Hong Kong's justice secretary gave a verbal agreement rather than conventional written advice to police to charge protesters with rioting this week, the Post has learned, in a move viewed as ­eagerness to ""fast-track"" prosecutions and send a deterrent ­message to demonstrators.
Two legal sources also said Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah signed off on using the riot offence as a holding charge, instead of prosecuting the ­accused on a lesser charge of ­unlawful assembly, for which they were originally arrested.
Revelations of the unprecedented hardline action came after anonymous prosecutors issued an open letter on Wednesday accusing Cheng of applying political considerations in her decisions to prosecute. Her spokesman called the accusations groundless.
But despite the rioting charge being laid on 44 protesters - the first such batch to face the prospect of up to 10 years in jail if found guilty - the city was bracing for a ninth consecutive weekend of multiple demonstrations. Kicking off today will be a rally by about 2,000 civil servants, while a planned citywide strike on Monday would bookend the weekend.
On the eve of the civil servants' protest, the government warned that those who flouted the rules of political neutrality and loyalty to the chief executive and administration would face consequences.
It was ""totally unacceptable"" for civil servants to compromise themselves politically, it said, signalling that engaging in actions such as penning anonymous open letters or joining strikes or assemblies would damage public confidence in the service.
The prosecutions of the 44, arrested in Sunday's protests, and the anonymous letter by prosecutors sparked debate in the legal fraternity, with concerns mounting on why the cases were given priority over the white shirt perpetrators of mob violence in Yuen Long a week earlier on July 21.
The legal sector also made waves yesterday when the usually cautious Law Society called for an independent inquiry, adding its voice to a growing list of individuals and mainstream institutions appealing for such a move to mend rifts in society.
Baptist University president Professor Roland Chin Tai-hong was the third university chief to issue a statement on the way ahead, calling for a ""truth ­commission"".
""Hong Kong citizens cherish freedom of expression and freedom of the press, and this combination has cultivated generations of truth-loving people. We must not shy away from the inconvenient truth about what has happened, which has shocked us to the core over the last several weeks,"" he wrote in a letter to the university community.
Chinese University chief Professor Rocky Tuan Sung-chi declined to endorse the idea in a meeting with students.
After a relatively quiet Wednesday when a storm hit the city, protesters emerged again yesterday, including a flash mob of several hundred working in the finance industry in Central, and demonstrators at the Sha Tin mall that was the site of violent clashes between protesters and police a fortnight ago.
Two separate pro-government groups protested outside the headquarters of Cathay Pacific Airways and its majority shareholder Swire Pacific - at the airport and in Admiralty respectively - after one of its pilots was among the 44 charged with rioting on July 28 in Western district.
No plea was taken and their cases were adjourned to September for further investigation. The protest was among the most recent in nearly two months of anti-government demonstrations sparked by the now-abandoned extradition bill.
Even as the DOJ sought to quash accusations by the anonymous group, questions began emerging on why the police still had not gone after the 100 attackers of protesters and bystanders at Yuen Long MTR station on July 21 with all the available CCTV evidence. Only 12 were arrested and all had been released on bail with no one charged.
Asked about the seemingly different sense of urgency, a police spokesman said: ""The police attach great importance to the related cases and take a cautious approach to handle prosecution work. The force will continue to deal with lawbreaking acts in an impartial manner and take appropriate follow-up action in accordance with evidence.""
Eric Cheung Tat-ming, principal law lecturer at the University of Hong Kong, said the apparent disparity in attention being paid could create the ""reasonable suspicion of political motive"".
""With all the information surfaced but no charges laid, how is that neutral and fair?"" he said.
Critics said the first large-scale slate of prosecutions for rioting - rather than the lesser charge of unlawful assembly - could have a serious deterrent.
""It will send a signal that violent protests may have legal consequences,"" Bill Li On-yin of the Progressive Lawyers' Group said.
Rioting carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail, while unlawful assembly sentences are capped at five years.
During recent protests, many of which ended in violence, police had repeatedly warned protesters they were taking part in an unlawful assembly. The force had not mentioned protesters were rioting since clashes near the legislature on June 12.
In a meeting with police, according to the sources, justice secretary Cheng and top prosecutor David Leung Cheuk-yin supported the force's decision to use the rioting charge against the 44. The sources also said Cheng had directed that all prosecutions arising from protests in the past two months must be cleared by her.
In Wednesday's anonymous four-page letter, written on a DOJ letterhead, the authors said the department should control criminal prosecutions and be free from any interference, as laid out in the Basic Law.
""Two of the most important principles of prosecution are: before each prosecution is made, we must consider whether there is reasonable chance of conviction, and whether the prosecution is in the public interest,"" it read.
Former public prosecutions chief Grenville Cross criticised those behind the letter, calling it a ""shocking development"" as they had compromised their position."
South China Morning Post,2019-11-14,"city crippled for a third straight day Protesters disrupt train services and traffic, with schools a",945 ,"
Hard-core protesters crippled Hong Kong for a third straight day yesterday as they disrupted traffic and train services, forcing schools and businesses to close while ­major universities took the ­unprecedented step of ending term early in a bid to defuse the ­escalating violence.
After two days of the worst clashes between protesters and police over the past five months of a hardening political impasse, the city woke up to more gridlock with the Cross-Harbour Tunnel barricaded as early as 6am, roads blocked and trains slowing down as protesters wreaked havoc at several stations.
The radicals again put up barricades and carpeted roads with bricks in multiple places, including the Central financial district, Mong Kok, Kowloon Tong, Yuen Long and Tuen Mun.
Their actions continued throughout the day and, at night, a flash mob appeared at the Cross-Harbour Tunnel toll booths and set them on fire, as panicked attendants fled in fear. By nightfall, the mobs had taken over roads in at least 10 districts, putting up barriers of bamboo and bricks mounted like Lego blocks and setting objects on fire.
Throughout the day, fights and scuffles once again broke out. Outside Sheung Shui MTR station, a 70-year-old man who was among residents clearing bricks littered by protesters was hit in the head after his group and a black-clad crowd engaged in a brick-throwing skirmish. The retiree, fighting for his life in hospital last night, was among 58 people, aged one to 81, injured yesterday.
At Chinese University, where protesters and police engaged in a 16-hour stand-off and bitterly clashed at a bridge, riot officers were nowhere to be seen yesterday. Protesters had regained control of the bridge which stands over Tolo Highway and reinforced barricades with more furniture, bins and poles. Bags packed with petrol bombs were lined along the bridge in case the police returned.
The highway was empty of traffic as protesters gained control of the major expressway connecting the New Territories towns to the rest of the city. ""U-turn or you pay your price - this is the warning from students of Chinese University,"" protesters chanted at any passing car, threatening to throw bricks at drivers who refused to leave the highway.
Protesters took over a college on campus and used its kitchen to serve meals. They converted the stadium into a rest area and a field was used to practise hurling petrol bombs.
A male protester, aged in his 30s, insisted police had no right to enter the campus and should pledge they would not return ""so students can ease their minds"".
But the High Court last night dismissed an injunction application by student leader Jacky So Tsun-fung to ban police from entering the Sha Tin campus, ruling that officers were entitled to enter any premises to ""prevent a breach of the peace"".
Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu also insisted no place in the city was beyond the long arm of the law. ""Universities should not be a place which breed ­violence,"" he said.
At a police briefing, Chief Superintendent John Tse Chun-chung described the violence of the protesters at Chinese University as a bad omen for Hong Kong.
""We have strong suspicions that the school was used as a weapons factory,"" he said.
Senior Superintendent Kong Wing-cheung said 1,576 rounds of tear gas, 1,312 rubber bullets, 380 beanbag rounds and 126 sponge-tipped rounds were fired on Tuesday, while protesters hurled ""hundreds"" of petrol bombs, and at Chinese University, at least three flaming arrows.
Since the unrest sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill began in June, police have ­arrested more than 4,000 people, with 39.3 per cent students and nearly half of those from tertiary institutions. On Tuesday, 142 people were arrested.
Mainland students at Chinese University and other foreign students have left amid the growing violence. By yesterday, more than 80 mainland students had left the university, evacuated across the border with the help of Marine Police. Taiwanese students at the university also received a note from the student association and Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council advising them to leave Hong Kong and return home. Dozens of students signed up for the plan.
Across the city, many shops were forced to close as staff could not get to work on time because of the transport disruption. Apart from the rush-hour service suspension on three key railway lines, the closure of train stations and the cancellation of last night's Happy Valley race meeting, banks also shut a record 250 branches.
The Hospital Authority said some hospital and clinical services, including elective surgeries, could be affected as staff could not get to work on time. A lecture to top Hong Kong officials by Zhang Xiaoming, chief of the State ­Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, was postponed.
At the height of transport disruptions, train services on the entire East Rail line, Kwun Tong line, Tsuen Wan line, and part of the West Rail line were suspended and 70 bus services ground to a halt.
The MTR said the East Rail line had to shut because two trains at Sheung Shui and another at University station were set on fire by protesters early yesterday, while Kowloon Tong station was vandalised with a petrol bomb thrown on its tracks.
At lunch time, protesters again descended on Central with a few vandalising the Bank of Communications branch on Pedder Street.
Protesters are planning to cause mayhem again today.

South China Morning Post,2019-06-25,Beijing rules out discussion of HK issues at G20 summit Foreign ministry takes tough stance as prote,556 ,"
The public backlash and mass protests against the Hong Kong government's now-suspended extradition bill would not be brought up or allowed to be ­discussed at the G20 summit in Osaka, Beijing made clear yesterday, even as protesters from the city planned to take their case to an international audience there.
The stern stance from the ­foreign ministry follows a ­dramatic week in the city, during which millions marched and young activists held large ­protests that crippled government ­operations.
The protesters were demanding the government completely withdraw the unpopular bill, which would allow the transfer of fugitives to the mainland and ­other jurisdictions that Hong Kong does not have a deal with.
""I can tell you for sure that the G20 will not discuss the affairs of Hong Kong. We will not allow the G20 to talk about Hong Kong matters,"" assistant minister of foreign affairs Zhang Jun said yesterday.
When asked what might ­happen if United States President Donald Trump insisted on talking about Hong Kong, Zhang said: ""We will not allow any country or anybody to meddle in the internal affairs of China by any means.""
President Xi Jinping is set to meet Trump on the sidelines of the meeting of leading and emerging economies in Japan. Trump had earlier called the ­city's protesters ""very effective"" despite declining to voice support for their specific demands.
Protesters hope to take advantage of the summit to increase international pressure on the ­local and national governments.
Andy Chan Ho-tin, the ­convenor of the banned Hong Kong National Party, had on ­Sunday called on Hongkongers to join him in staging rallies and ­protests in Osaka.
Chan said the actions were ­organised by the Free Indo- ­Pacific Alliance, a group that ­represents exiled ­minorities, ­including Tibetans.
The Civil ­Human Rights Front - which ­organised the two massive marches earlier this month - will hold a rally tomorrow, two days before global leaders meet at the G20, to urge the international community to put pressure on Xi and Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor over the ­extradition bill saga.
""We appeal to the millions of Hongkongers who have come out in the two historic Sunday marches to come out again, to send a clear message to the world: ­withdraw the extradition bill,"" the front's convenor, Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, said.
The rally - named the ""G20 Free Hong Kong"" assembly - will begin at 8pm at Edinburgh Place in Central.
Sham said the front had no plans to protest in Osaka, but slammed the foreign ministry's earlier statement calling for no interference in Hong Kong affairs by global leaders as ""ridiculous"".
""It's like a person who has serious violent tendencies and hits members of his family, but tells his neighbours not to interfere in his internal family affairs. Is this ­reasonable?"" he said.
He also demanded the government address protesters' ­demands, including withdrawal of the bill and an independent ­inquiry into the ""excessive use of force"" by police during clashes outside the legislature on June 12.
Meanwhile former Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief Joseph Yam Chi-kwong, now an adviser to Lam in the Executive Council, said China-US tensions and the situation in the city were ­worrying and called on the ­finance sector to stay united to win the confidence of Hongkongers and overseas ­investors."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-24,MTR acts to bar protesters from stations Rail giant granted court injunction to prevent activists fr,707 ,"
Hong Kong's embattled railway operator secured an injunction from the High Court last night to prevent anti-government ­protesters from besieging and ­vandalising its train stations.
Mr Justice Anderson Chow ­Ka-ming granted an interim ­injunction order in favour of the MTR Corporation after hearing submissions from its lawyers.
In a late-night statement, the MTR said the injunction would ­restrain people from ""unlawfully and wilfully obstructing or interfering with the proper use of the stations and trains of the railway network"" as well as the high-speed rail terminus.
The interim injunction, effective until 30 August, also forbids people from ""damaging any property or trains and using any threatening, abusive, obscene or offensive language or wilfully interfering with the comfort or convenience of any MTR staff at any station"".
The MTR made the move as state media issued a warning to the rail operator against any attempt to facilitate what they called ""rioters"" in destabilising ­actions, otherwise the company would run the risk of ""derailing and slipping into the abyss"".
There was chaos again at Kwai Fong station yesterday, after the MTR ­decided to suspend services at 9pm to head off a repeat of the previous night's protest.
But even after the station was closed, protesters already inside stayed behind to besiege the control room, vandalising the premises and demanding to be allowed to use trains. That was after the MTR issued a statement strongly condemning protesters who stormed Kwai Fong station on Thursday night, vandalising facilities such as the entrance gate and hurling expletives at rail staff.
The rail operator said their ­actions had undermined the safety of MTR employees and ­passengers.
About 200 protesters swarmed the station to demand the MTR Corp explain why police were able to fire tear gas inside the station on August 11, resulting in the temporary closure of two exits.
""In light of recent repeated ­instances where stations' facilities were vandalised, MTR staff ­harassed and the safety of staff and passengers threatened ... the MTR Corp is taking all necessary action to uphold safety, including taking appropriate legal action and making suitable regulation of station and train service operations if the situation so warrants,"" it said.
""We support proper enforcement of the law against these ­illegal activities and reserve the right to take suitable legal action and seek suitable legal redress from the courts, including, if ­appropriate, injunctions to ­ensure that the safe and proper operations and use of our network can be ­assured.""
Transport minister Frank Chan Fan also weighed in, saying various MTR stations had been ­attacked and suffered damage, with staff abused by protesters.
""Due to these effects and safety threats caused to residents, their staff and passengers, the MTR Corp is handling the ­injunction work,"" he said, adding that the measure was mainly to ban or prevent illegal actions from ­interfering with passengers' ­journeys.
The rail firm took a tougher stance against protesters, with ­operations director Adi Lau ­Tin-shing holding an urgent meeting with unions yesterday after announcing that services could be stopped and the station immediately closed without prior notice in the event of ""fights, vandalism or other acts of violence"".
The MTR followed the example of the Airport Authority, which secured an injunction to stop anyone from ""unlawfully and wilfully obstructing or interfering with the proper use"" of Hong Kong International Airport. Yesterday, the injunction was indefinitely extended by the High Court.
The MTR Corp, in which the Hong Kong government has a 75 per cent stake, has come under ­increasing pressure to get tough on protesters as Beijing expressed dismay at its softly-softly ­approach to dealing with their ­actions at stations.
Mainland media has launched scathing attacks on the firm, criticising it for being lenient with protesters and providing an escape route for those who attack police, causing havoc in its stations and then taking train rides to safety.
However, MTR staff have also been unhappy with the company's response to police actions in station premises. They have complained about the use of force against protesters."
South China Morning Post,2019-10-08,Lohas Park sales fall flat as protests dampen mood Buyers keep an eye on social unrest as 20 of 101,380 ,"
A batch of new flats at a project in Tseung Kwan O failed to attract buyers yesterday as increasingly violent anti-government protests continued to rattle sentiment in the world's most expensive ­housing market.
By 8pm, Wheelock Properties had sold only 20 of 101 flats in the latest batch at its Grand Marini project in Lohas Park.
The flats sold were mainly one- and two-bedroom units at HK$7 million to HK$8 ­million, ­according to Sammy Po Siu-ming, the chief executive of Midland Realty's ­residential ­division.
""It's lower than expected,"" Po said. ""Buyers remain watchful and are observing how the social [unrest] is developing.""
The protests in Hong Kong, which were initially against the now-shelved extradition bill but have now switched to calling for broader ­democratic reform, have come on top of the US-China trade war, which had already drained appetite for property in the city.
Yesterday's property sale also marked the first such event after the law ­banning protesters from wearing face masks was introduced on ­Friday.
Wheelock went ahead with its scheduled sales plan on Chung Yeung Festival, a public holiday, when most MTR stations were closed after repeated ­vandalism by protesters.
""Buyers and property agents can't even go out to the sale or to work,"" said Vincent Cheung, managing director of Vincorn Consulting and Appraisal.
""Market sentiment has ­definitely been hit by the violent clashes. But I can only tell how much confidence has been lost after public transport returns to normal.
""Investors, including occupiers, care if the city is safe. After some more time, say two weeks, we will see if the anti-mask law stops people protesting. Buyers will be concerned if the new rule is not effective and ­wonder what else the government can do.""
The number of Hongkongers who believe home prices in the city will fall in the next 12 months has doubled to 56 per cent, ­according to a Citi Hong Kong ­survey of 500 people released late last month.
In the secondary market, homeowners are slashing prices by more than 20 per cent as buyers are reluctant to commit to big purchases and banks reduce the valuation of properties as the demonstrations head for a fifth month.
Wheelock's other projects in Lohas Park proved very popular before the unrest began in June."
South China Morning Post,2019-06-30,Huge lockdown ahead of handover anniversary Massive lockdown ahead of ceremonies to mark 22nd annive,696 ,"
Thousands of riot police are on standby and an unprecedented lockdown has begun to ­discourage any major disruption by extradition bill protesters ahead of one of the most ­important official events of the year for Hong Kong - the July 1 ­anniversary of the city's handover to Chinese sovereignty.
Sources told the Post yesterday that around 5,000 riot personnel would be ready for any trouble, while the government announced the Hong Kong ­Convention and Exhibition ­Centre in Wan Chai would be sealed off from today, given that protesters were planning to target the flag-raising ceremony nearby that would also be scaled down for the first time.
A government source said the authorities were preparing for a wide range of scenarios at the flag-raising ceremony in Golden ­Bauhinia Square and the cocktail reception after that at the convention centre to mark the 22nd ­anniversary of the handover.
San Tsz-kin, police deputy ­district commander for Central, would only say: ""We have ­received information that someone will disturb the flag-raising ceremony, therefore the police have made some appropriate ­arrangements after conducting risk assessments.""
But force insiders, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were prepared for the possibility of violence by protesters demanding the complete withdrawal of the now-suspended bill, which would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to the mainland and ­other jurisdictions with which Hong Kong does not have an ­extradition deal.
Police yesterday were already limiting access to the flag-raising venue, while security was also tightened around the convention centre as well as the legislative and administrative headquarters in Admiralty.
Measures were also being taken to head off any future siege of the Arsenal Street police headquarters after it was surrounded by protesters who trapped officers ­inside for hours and vandalised the building twice in a week.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, who has not ­appeared in public since June 18 when she apologised for her ­government's mishandling of the unpopular bill, is among the Hong Kong and mainland officials, business leaders and other ­dignitaries attending the July 1 event.
Lam, whose office issued a photograph of her morale-boosting meeting with police union leaders on Friday, has doubled down on her refusal to completely withdraw the bill or exonerate protesters arrested for earlier clashes with police.
Protesters in turn have called on the public to gather at Golden Bauhinia Square at 9.30pm today to rehearse and sing the national anthem overnight, before staging a protest there at 6.30am ­tomorrow to disrupt the ­official ceremony.
The government has not only scaled back this year's ceremony, with students and uniformed groups who took part in previous years staying away, it has also said the celebration could be moved indoors in the event of a rainstorm - which has never happened since the handover in 1997.
The Civil Human Rights Front, which organises the annual pro-democracy march on July 1 from Victoria Park to government headquarters in Admiralty, is ­expecting a massive turnout this time.
The group organised two mass rallies against the extradition bill on consecutive Sundays this month, the second of which drew an estimated 2 million people ­onto the streets.
In response to the sieges at ­police headquarters, top brass met on Friday night to discuss counter-strategies.
""A robust plan will be in place,"" a source said.
Another source said police had studied different strategies to stop protesters from besieging its base, including an option to set up a cordon before the arrival of demonstrators.
In the two sieges on June 21 and June 26, officers stood ­passively behind glass doors and gates as protesters sealed off all entrances, pelted the building with eggs, and painted obscene graffiti on the walls.
Officers took no action during the 15-hour siege by thousands of protesters on June 21.
The six-hour siege on June 26 ended after officers standing by at the headquarters and nearby streets chased away the remaining protesters at about 3am the following day, when their ­numbers had dwindled from hundreds at the peak."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-25,Pro-establishment supporters rally against RTHK Protesters claim station is biased and should revers,471 ,"
The city's public broadcaster RTHK and journalists from other media outlets became the target of hundreds of pro-government protesters who picketed the station's premises in Kowloon Tong, hurling insults and surrounding reporters for an hour yesterday.
Politihk Social Strategic, the organiser of the rally, claimed more than 10,000 surrounded broadcaster RTHK's headquarters in the afternoon. Police estimated peak attendance at 1,200.
""In the past, RTHK has always been biased. We demand RTHK hand over extra airtime to the citizens,"" said Tang Tak-shing, the group's chairman. ""We want diverse voices of citizens and no more anti-government messages. When all of the media is watching the government, RTHK should represent the voice of the ­government."" He said the group would form a ""citizens' production committee"" to create programming to fill the extra airtime.
Journalists have become a target of pro-establishment supporters during protests against the now-suspended extradition bill. They have been accused of filming only police brutality and barely reporting on violent behaviour of anti-government protesters.
Ng Man-yee, head of RTHK's corporate communications and standards, received a letter detailing demands of the protesters. ""We have heard your demands,"" Ng said.
The broadcaster invited members of the public to express their opinions through RTHK's Community Involvement Broadcasting Service, RTHK Television Programme Commissioning Projects and radio phone-in ­programmes.
Earlier in the day, Politihk Social Strategic urged protesters not to bring sticks or metal rods and to hold a peaceful rally.
But the situation quickly descended into chaos as the mostly elderly crowd began to surround individual reporters and photographers, hitting cameras and swinging punches. A photographer said his camera lens was licked by a protester.
""Black reporters, you know the law yet you break it, where is your conscience?"" the protesters shouted at the reporters.
""[You] reverse black and white and support those rioters, let me say now, 80 per cent of the media is black media,"" said one protester, declining to give his name. ""You call the police black cops, but the gentlest police in the world are in Hong Kong,"" he said.
Tang said the journalists at the scene had provoked protesters. ""And anyway ... not all of them are members of our group, so I cannot be responsible for their actions,"" he said.
Earlier, the Hong Kong Association of Media Veterans published a letter addressed to RTHK director Leung Ka-wing in local papers in which it criticised the behaviour of two RTHK female reporters at government press conferences.
""The two women reporters screamed at and interrupted [Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor]. They were not asking questions as journalists, rather behaving like judges,"" the letter said."
South China Morning Post,2019-07-02,How peaceful principles gave way as protester anger reached boiling point,672 ,"
In 2014 at the height of the Occupy protests, Labour Party lawmaker Dr Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung tried to dissuade a group of young protesters from breaking into the Legislative Council complex with metal barricades - but to no avail.
Yesterday, the mediation efforts of the social worker at the very same venue came to naught again. This time, a much bigger crowd of protesters used a metal cage trolley and iron poles to shatter the glass exterior of the building. Cheung was left standing helplessly.
Glass doors at the entrances of the legislature were smashed in a violent showdown. As the holes in the doors grew bigger and a metal shutter was pried open, protesters flooded into the building, making their way into the legislative chamber, spray-painting graffiti and defacing the emblem of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
What moved them to such violent acts and whatever happened to the peaceful and non-violent principles the city had long embraced, as witnessed in protests over the past two decades?
Observers and protesters alike pointed to a real and perceptible shift among the demonstrators: that violence could be a means to achieve an end, even if the outcome was chaos and the cost was their arrest, and, in an extreme case, even their lives. At the same time, a much bigger proportion of Hongkongers appeared to be no longer opposed to violence.
""Young protesters' anger against the government reached boiling point today,"" Cheung said. ""They argued they had no choice but to escalate their protests given the inaction of Chief Executive Carrie Lam ChengYuet-ngor.""
Lam made her first public appearance in two weeks as she delivered a speech at the reception to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of the city's return to China. Despite offering an apology in person earlier over her handling of the bill, she refused to budge on any of the protesters' demands, such as holding an independent inquiry into the police's use of force in earlier anti-bill protests.
Cheung told the Post the recent suicide cases that appeared to be related to the bill were one of the trigger points. ""These protesters believe they should be held responsible for the three victims as they have failed to force the government to address their cause,"" he said.
""They are sad, angry, guilty and in despair. They have a strong desire to sacrifice themselves regardless of the consequences. This is very different from five years ago. It is very sad and a really dangerous sign.""
While the majority of Hongkongers still preferred peaceful protests, Cheung emphasised it was no longer just a small group of people advocating physical clashes. ""We are talking about thousands here,"" he said.
A number of pan-democratic lawmakers, who had been trying to be peacemakers, had succeeded at times in stopping protesters from escalating their actions over the past weeks. But yesterday, they found themselves outflanked and shouted down as the crowd grew more agitated.
Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting knelt before the angry protesters - almost all wearing helmets and masks and with cling film over their limbs - and begged them to calm down.
Roy Kwong Chun-yu, his party colleague who used to be popular among the protesters in the movement, was called ""useless"" when he tried to reason with them.
When lawmaker Leung Yiu-chung stood between the protesters with the metal trolley and the glass door, a protester in helmet and goggles tackled him to the ground. ""They questioned what could the legislature still achieve when even 2 million people have failed to budge the government,"" Leung said, referring to the anti-bill march on June 16. ""Sadly, I could not answer.
""These young people are in despair and they have no hope towards the government any more.""
While the vast majority of participants during the Occupy protests had emphasised ""love and peace"" in their demands for universal suffrage, the threshold for confrontation and violence seemed to have been lowered, five years on.

South China Morning Post,2019-07-16,"How shopping centres turned into battlegrounds As the city reels from chaotic scenes in Sha Tin, pro",1469 ,"
As riot police advanced towards hundreds of protesters gathered on the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday night, few could have imagined the scenes of chaos and bloodshed that would follow.
Shocking images of bloodied faces, a severed finger, head wounds, a police officer kicked from an escalator and viciously assaulted by youths as he lay on the ground, and protesters ­pepper-sprayed and beaten with batons painted a stark contrast to the peaceful demonstration that had taken place earlier in the day.
In total, 28 protesters and officers sought help from accident and emergency departments in the city's public hospitals.
Protesters and local councillors blamed police for the chaos, claiming demonstrators departing the shopping malls had been directed one way, only to meet more advancing officers head-on.
A police source said the force just wanted the protesters to leave peacefully, but once a torrent of bricks, helmets and umbrellas rained down from above, officers were forced to react.
Another police source said ­officers were angry and frustrated at what they called their management's decision to persist with a tactic of tolerance, even as frontline officers suffered so much ­verbal abuse during the earlier march. ""Some protesters even threw dog food in front of officers to insult them,"" the source said.
Police top brass simply ­wanted a positive show of public relations, leaving frontline officers to bear the brunt of the city's anger, he added.
Since last month, more than 10 officers have resigned, according to a third police source. It was unclear whether the ­resignations were related to the protests.
Earlier in the day, around 3pm, thousands of protesters, young and old, from all walks of life, gathered at a playground near the temple of Che Kung - a military commander from the Song ­dynasty known for suppressing uprisings. They were there to demand the complete withdrawal of the now-suspended extradition bill that could have resulted in the transfer of fugitives from Hong Kong to any other jurisdiction, including the mainland.
The first protesters arrived at the march's destination, a bus ­terminal next to Sha Tin MTR ­station, about 90 minutes later. As they began to disperse, a shout went up: ""Police pepper-sprayed protesters on Yuen Wo Road!""
Two witnesses said the action had been incited by protesters throwing traffic cones at officers stationed near Yuen Wo Road Sports Centre.
About 20 officers then rushed the protesters without warning, using pepper-spray indiscriminately, the witnesses added.
""The protesters were not wearing any [protective] gear,"" Claris Wong, 19, said, referring to the demonstrators' regular uniform of masks, goggles and helmets. Wong was sprayed on the arm, causing slight inflammation.
One after another, protesters ran towards the sports centre to back up their comrades. They took metal railings and used them to block off all five lanes of Yuen Wo Road, fearing police armed with guns, batons and long shields would pursue them. Any hope the demonstration could continue peacefully was gone.
Some 40 metres apart on the intersection of Yuen Wo Road and Sha Tin Rural Committee Road, the stand-off between police and protesters began.
Protesters spent the next two hours discussing strategy - should they stay or should they go? While they deliberated, dozens of riot police closed in from the south side of Sha Tin Rural Committee Road at 7.30pm. Half an hour later, more officers came in from the north. Now, the protesters' only way out was onto Yuen Wo Road towards Sha Tin Town Hall.
But at 8.30pm, officers approached from there too. Protesters, cornered on all sides, fled into three connected shopping malls: Lucky Plaza, Sha Tin Centre and the scene of the bloodiest clashes, New Town Plaza.
As officers chased down and subdued several protesters, others on higher floors of the malls pelted them with helmets, bottles and other items, forcing them to take cover under their shields.
The first police source said the force persisted with a ""restrained and tolerant"" approach, seeking only to disperse protesters and avoid violent clashes. But the assault from above left them little choice, he added. ""A bag with a brick and unknown powder ­inside was hurled down at one point,"" the source said.
Sha Tin District Councillor Wai Hing-cheung said residents of estates built above two of the malls had complained officers chased protesters into communal areas. ""These are private properties. Even if some protesters did take refuge on the podium, did the police have the right to enter? Some of those harassed were residents,"" Wai said.
The Police General Orders ­allow officers to enter and search any premises without a warrant, if they have reason to believe a ­person to be arrested was inside, ­according to the Community Legal Information Centre of the University of Hong Kong.
The second police source said 3,000 officers were deployed in total on Sunday, more than the 2,000 originally planned. He said the force had enough resources to arrest hundreds of protesters blocking roads under the least heavy offence of unlawful assembly. But police management let them go. ""This led to running ­battles in the shopping centres and the bloody clashes in New Town ­Plaza,"" he said.
He was saddened by the decision he felt had left the Hong Kong police force looking ""useless"". ""Crimes took place in front of our officers but we took no action and let them go. It's very sad.""
At around 9.50pm, officers chased protesters all the way into New Town Plaza. To their ­surprise, they were outnumbered. Surreal scenes followed as protesters surrounded small groups of officers and assaulted them - kicking, punching and attacking them with umbrellas as others hurled objects from floors above. Officers scrambled to hold on to their shields, many falling to the ground under the ­onslaught. Officers again used pepper spray.
In one extreme case, a plain-clothes officer was assaulted by dozens of protesters as he lay on the ground, until a journalist came to the rescue. A witness said the officer was taking an escalator to an upper floor when he realised a group of protesters was lying in wait. He tried to retreat but was kicked from behind. He fell and was jumped by the crowd.
In another case, an officer had part of his finger bitten off.
Some protesters also sustained injuries as they fought off officers. One was seen bleeding from the face, another with T-shirt completely torn.
More riot police arrived and it was not until around 11pm, with most protesters leaving, that ­officers finally retreated.
The Heung Yee Kuk rural body, which is headquartered in Sha Tin, condemned the protesters' ""beastlike"" behaviour and said it was dangerous to throw umbrellas and helmets from above.
Billy Chan Shiu-yeung, another Sha Tin District Councillor, condemned the police violence.
Chan said at around 8.30pm, he asked officers how protesters should leave. ""More than one officer told me to take the MTR, and that it was safe,"" he said. But at the station, located next to New Town Plaza, he saw officers stopping anyone from taking the train.
The force would also not allow protesters to leave the mall through a nearby exit, he said, leaving everyone confused. ""The officers looked like they had lost their mind. There were shoppers and other passers-by who just wanted to leave,"" he said. ""Some were children. They had just had dinner and wanted to go home.""
As police engaged in running battles with protesters inside New Town Plaza, officers outside ­arrested 33 people near Sha Tin Town Hall, on suspicion of taking part in an unlawful assembly.
Legal sources said one was a first-aider surnamed Mak, a registered nurse. He was wearing a vest clearly identifying him as a medical worker when he was arrested.
Democratic Party lawmaker Roy Kwong Chun-yu, who was at the scene slammed ""ridiculous"" police tactics. ""The clearance operation in the mall was an international laughing stock,"" he said.
""It was unnecessary for them to disperse and pepper-spray the crowd. They scared children to tears and were waving their batons at the passers-by ... is this something [Chief Executive ­Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor] wants to see?""
New Town Plaza had earlier claimed they did not call police, but netizens were unconvinced. A clip that seemed to show the mall's staff leading officers into the centre was widely circulated online. Users of popular online forum LIHKG called for a boycott of all shopping centres under the mall's management company, Sun Hung Kai Properties. The company had not responded to inquiries related to the clip.
As calm returned to Sha Tin the day after the chaos, one thing was certain: far from being ­deterred, the protesters are galvanised to prepare for their next march, and the next.

South China Morning Post,2019-08-20,'Great Firewall' exposes divisions over HK protests 'Great Firewall' exposes the divisions Media-sav,867 ,"
Hong Kong's summer of protests looks very different on either side of the ""Great Firewall"" that ­encircles the mainland internet.
Yesterday morning, the top trending topic on Weibo, China's highly regulated version of ­Twitter, featured a Shanghai ­tourist who was ""harassed and beaten"" during the massive protest on Sunday evening. It has had 520 million views.
A prominent video on the ­topic from Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily showed the man, surnamed Ma, telling reporters about protesters accosting and accusing him of photographing their faces, under the tagline: ""Is this the 'safety' that rioters are talking about?""
But in Hong Kong, the focus was on the peaceful Sunday demonstrations, which organisers said drew 1.7 million people despite heavy rain.
On LIHKG, the online forum where protesters discuss and organise their actions, one hot topic celebrated Weibo posts on Ma that mentioned a taboo - Beijing's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. The topic cheered the ""first time Weibo allowed public discussion of June 4"", referencing posts about Photoshopped ­images of Ma in a shirt calling for justice over the crackdown.
Since the protests began in early June, triggered by a now-shelved extradition bill, there has been a clear dichotomy between how the movement has been portrayed online. While Hong Kong protesters use social media to organise and rally the world to their cause, mainlanders are used to a counter-narrative fuelled by state ­media and censorship.
As the city enters an 11th week of anti-government protests, this dichotomy has created antagonism and conflict online. It has seen ugly exchanges playing out across social media between young Hong Kong activists and mainlanders, including from internet trolling groups.
The protesters, tapping into experience from the 2014 ­""umbrella movement"", have formed a grass-roots public relations campaign, with protest art made to go viral and packaged content about police violence and government ineptitude.
Encrypted app Telegram and LIHKG had been ""very important and effective"" for their ­on-the-ground coordination and strategy discussion, with platforms such as Facebook used to spread information, said Michael Chan, an associate professor at Chinese University's School of Journalism and Communication.
""Through Facebook, they can easily disseminate news, video clips and other media about the protests among 'friend' networks that transcend national boundaries and reach sympathetic audiences around the world,"" he said. In contrast to the protesters' ""young, dynamic and creative movement"", mainlanders were not as well versed in the language of international liberal discourse, said Florian Schneider, a senior lecturer in modern Chinese politics at Leiden University in the Netherlands.
That includes the state media-endorsed Diba forum, a fiercely nationalist group that prides itself on internet trolling and targeted harassment.
""The social media efforts from mainland China, with their nationalist outlook and law-and-order rhetoric, look like crude CCP propaganda and are unlikely to get much traction among foreign media users,"" Schneider said. ""[It] works well [ on the mainland], where nationalism is often the default mindset for making sense of politics.""
Chinese state media have led the charge online, with news agency Xinhua posting a cartoon on Facebook depicting Hong Kong protesters as cockroaches and broadcaster CCTV posting a poem on Twitter likening demonstrators to Nazis.
Yuan Zeng, a lecturer at the University of Leeds in Britain, said the Chinese leadership had been ""strategically institutionalising social media"" into the party's propaganda machine with strict censorship and state media-led narratives. She said it had been effective and created a ""dangerous ideological divide"" between mainlanders and Hongkongers.
""You can observe an 'information curve' on the topic of Hong Kong during the past months: from no mention at all at the beginning to dry official statements, to today's all-round bellicose propaganda campaign,"" she said. ""These grass-roots campaigns [like Diba] are of course state-sanctioned. State media also use social media to echo and endorse such campaigns, which are largely aggressive.""
Users on both sides have also been vigilant about potential infiltration of their groups by outsiders. Hong Kong protesters have been communicating in Kongish - a mix of phonetically romanised Cantonese and English that is difficult to understand without knowledge of Hong Kong youth culture and language.
One post in Kongish on LIHKG said if there was a suspected ""ghost"" or infiltrator, they should be asked if they could understand something in the language. ""If he cannot read and understand, then you will know if he is a man or a 'ghost',"" it said.
The protesters have also been getting better at using encrypted apps and services.
As the protests continue, misinformation and disinformation may continue to plague the protesters in particular. Schneider said cherry-picked instances of bad protester behaviour and false information could influence public opinion about the movement, which was key to maintaining its momentum."
South China Morning Post,2019-09-30,"violence, chaos and a warning shot Violence, chaos and a warning shot as protests go on Admiralty, W",859 ,"
Rioting protesters set many parts of Hong Kong's bustling commercial streets ablaze yesterday as the city saw a 17th straight weekend of unrest.
Chaos and violence engulfed Admiralty, Wan Chai and Causeway Bay, with riot police battling mobs of protesters for hours. Amid the mayhem, a plain-clothes officer fired a live-round warning shot skywards to drive away protesters near him.
As of 10.30pm, 25 people had been taken to hospital with injuries and 100 people were arrested.
Yesterday's protests were ­noticeably more violent than those the day before, an ominous sign ahead of National Day tomorrow, when China will mark the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule.
Protesters have called for a general strike today and vowed to go out in full force tomorrow to spoil Beijing's celebrations. Sparked by a now-abandoned extradition bill, the protest movement has broadened, and the central government is a clear ­target.
The day began with thousands of protesters, defying a police ban, gathering in Causeway Bay to march to government headquarters in Admiralty. Police warned them it was an illegal assembly and they were obstructing traffic, and just before 2.30pm they fired the first round of tear gas at the crowd.
Many people ran into nearby shops for shelter but quickly regrouped, and the outnumbered riot police eventually pulled back while the protesters pressed on to Admiralty. A National Day billboard was removed from the ­Pacific Place footbridge and burned in the middle of the road.
Emotions ran high as protesters reached the barricaded government headquarters, with some throwing bricks and petrol bombs into it. Police used water cannon to disperse them, and fired tear gas and rubber bullets.
A 39-year-old Indonesian journalist was said to have been hit in the right eye by a projectile and was in a stable condition in hospital.
Some protesters headed for Wan Chai, venting their anger on the city's railway operator, the MTR Corporation. The company, whose majority shareholder is the government, has frequently been targeted by protesters who say it has colluded with the police. The MTR closed several stations in anticipation of trouble, including Wan Chai.
A mob of protesters smashed the windows at an entrance to the Wan Chai station, throwing at least two petrol bombs inside, and other objects. Unable to force open the shuttered gate, they eventually set the whole entrance on fire, creating a thick plume of black smoke.
Soon, fire broke out in many other places, from Admiralty to Causeway Bay. Some protesters tried to torch another MTR entrance in Causeway Bay and burned rubbish in the middle of the road near the Methodist Church in Wan Chai.
A block away, a huge bonfire was lit at the junction of Fleming Road and Lockhart Road, with riot police watching from the other side. The protesters tried to throw petrol bombs at them but most landed instead in the middle of the road. A shuttered shop around the corner briefly caught on fire.
Police also stepped up their use of force.
Tear gas was fired at far more frequent intervals than the day before, which marked the fifth anniversary of the largely peaceful Occupy protests in 2014. They also pepper-sprayed many protesters at close range, including lawmaker Eddie Chu Hoi-dick, who was not wearing a mask. The Special Tactical Squad, also known as Raptors, chased protesters up and down the streets, wrestling them to the ground to make arrests.
Just outside Pacific Place on Harcourt Road, police took away at least 37 suspects, and they also rounded up a few dozen on Queensway. The operation continued well into the night.
Later in the evening, scuffles broke out between protesters and people who argued with them.
In Causeway Bay, a man in black was kicked and punched by a group of protesters and his shirt was torn. He was knocked to the pavement and suffered head wounds and was eventually escorted away. The protesters accused him of being a ""gangster"" from Fujian.
In another incident, a man dressed in white was taken to ­hospital after he was beaten on the ground by a gang of protesters, who went on to stamp on him.
Also in Causeway Bay, a crowd surrounded a taxi, accusing the driver of speeding, saying he almost hit one of them. Police arrived and escorted the driver away but the crowd then smashed the taxi's windows, vandalised its interior and destroyed the engine.
Many shops and restaurants with owners considered to be pro-Beijing were also defaced and vandalised.
After another weekend of chaos, attention will now turn to tomorrow, when Beijing celebrates the founding of the ­People's Republic of China.
Yesterday, President Xi Jinping presented honorary medals to 42 Chinese and foreigners, including former Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, for their contributions to the country.
It was the first time the awards were given out, and Tung was the first person from Hong Kong to receive one - for his outstanding contribution to the ""one country, two systems"" principle that promised the city would retain its unique way of life after returning to Chinese rule.
But as Hong Kong's biggest political crisis continues, its future is far from certain."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-29,"Police to ban rally, march after violence escalates",531 ,"
Hong Kong police will ban a rally and march on Saturday by the ­organiser of three record-breaking mass protests overthe past two months, citingheightened safety concerns after last weekend's escalation ofviolence, the Post has learned.
The Civil Human Rights Front would be informed today of the ­rejection of its application, a ­police source revealed.
The move will likely spark more chaos and turmoil over the weekend, as the event would mark the fifth anniversary of the announcement of the electoral reform package by Beijing that was eventually rejected by Hong Kong.
The rally and march were supposed to call for genuine universal suffrage instead of having pre-vetted candidates for the chief executive and to reiterate the five key demands of the anti-government protests of the past two months, including the withdrawal of the now-shelved extradition bill and an independent inquiry.
The front planned to gather at Chater Garden in Central at 3pm and march to the liaison office, Beijing's representative body in the city, in Western district.
""Both the rally and the march will be objected to. The risk is too big. You can see the number of petrol bombs the protesters threw last weekend,"" the source said.
Clashes in Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan last weekend led to 86 people being arrested on suspicion of various offences, including illegal assembly and assaulting police. Police deployed water cannon for the first time and at one point an officer fired a live round into the air after several officers were chased and beaten by a mob wielding iron pipes and rods.
The ban would mark the first time the front had an entire event taken off the calendar.
Since the start of the extradition bill protests, which have since morphed into an anti-government movement, the front has organised key events that signalled the widespread opposition to the bill. On June 9, it estimated 1 million turned out to march against the bill and a week later, on June 16, it estimated 2 million protesters took to the streets. ­Police estimated 240,000 and 338,000 respectively.
Both events were peaceful. Most recently, in the aftermath of a series of weekend protests that descended into violence and mayhem, the front again organised a peaceful rally at Victoria Park on August 18 that it said attracted 1.7 million people; police estimated 128,000 people.
Some 23 protests since early June had turned chaotic or violent, according to figures cited by police in a letter issued on Monday to object to the Confederation of Trade Unions' plan to stage a rally at ­Cathay City this week.
The banning of the front's event could set in motion a plan by a group of protesters calling for a general strike on Monday if the government did not accede to their five demands by Saturday.
The planned industrial action would be the second strike organised in the city within a month. It would coincide with the launch of a two-week class boycott by students from 10 universities.
In a joint declaration, activists called on people to join a two-day strike and attend rallies in Tsim Sha Tsui, Admiralty and Central from next Monday if the five demands were not met by Saturday.

South China Morning Post,2019-07-08,YOUNG AND OLD UNITE IN KOWLOON MASS rally Moderates turn out in force in display of solidarity with,568 ,"
Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement against the extradition bill received a shot in the arm to keep the pressure on the government to completely withdraw the unpopular legislation, political commentators said after yesterday's mass rally in Kowloon.
The fact the older generation had turned out in force to support youngsters spearheading the movement meant that the recent protest violence, widely condemned across the city, had not turned public opinion in favour of the administration, they said.
Speaking after the protest in Kowloon that organisers said was attended by more than 230,000 people, Dr Cheung Chor-yung, a senior teaching fellow at the City University's department of public policy, said: ""By whatever measure, the turnout was huge.
""Some people are getting more sympathetic to the protesters because they see that the government is too stubborn and has not responded to the demands by the demonstrators despite rounds of protests, be they peaceful or ­violent.
""The general public may not support the mob that stormed the legislature, but that does not mean they would support the Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor government's handling of the issue.""
Political analyst Dr Ma Ngok, of Chinese University, said: ""The public have not distanced themselves from the young protesters. It is clear that people have more sympathy and understanding ­towards their ­action.""
Ma added that the coming ­rallies in other districts would ­further weaken the government's credibility and legitimacy if it ­refused to respond to the protesters' demands.
Yesterday's march was the latest major protest sparked by anger over the government's handling of the extradition bill.
It was also the first major protest organised in Kowloon.
The organisers claimed 230,000 people took part, while the police put the estimate at 56,000.
The Tsim Sha Tsui tourist area was on the verge of lockdown yesterday with landmarks swamped by protesters, shops shut, and the cross-border high-speed rail terminus turned into a no-go zone.
Police made their presence known along the march route, from Salisbury Garden at the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront to the express rail terminus in West Kowloon, to avoid a repeat of the ugly scenes of last Monday when a mob broke into the legislature and went on a rampage.
While the violence was widely condemned, it appeared the July 1 storming had not dispelled public sympathy for the protests against the now-suspended bill, which would have allowed for the transfer of fugitives from Hong Kong to jurisdictions with which the city has no such arrangement, notably the mainland.
The demonstrators, many dressed in black and wearing masks, carried banners calling for the full withdrawal of the bill, as well as the release of protesters ­arrested during previous clashes.
Some protesters chanted ­slogans in Mandarin, in the hope mainland visitors would ­sympathise with their cause. Some tourists said they realised the protesters were only exercising their rights, while some shop owners believed the impact on business would be ­acceptable.
A 73-year-old protester, surnamed Hung, said he could understand the youths' anger.
""The ideal case was that we wouldn't need to storm [Legco],"" Hung said. ""But the students and the citizens could bear no more. They felt that the government would not respond to their ­demands.
""The government won't take you seriously If you are too peaceful. Sometimes force is needed."""
South China Morning Post,2019-09-15,Hong Kong has no future if independent judiciary undermined,468 ,"
Three months of protests in Hong Kong have led to more than 1,300 arrests. The first cases are now being heard by the courts. It is of paramount importance that the city's independent judiciary is allowed to get on with its job of dispensing justice freely and fairly.
Sadly, the courts are already coming under attack from both supporters of police and protesters. On Thursday, a pro-government group staged a protest outside the Court of Final Appeal attended by about 100 people. It called for Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma Tao-li to step down, alleging that the legal system is biased in favour of anti-government protesters and treats them leniently. There is no evidence to support these accusations which show ignorance of the way the courts works.
One focus of complaints from such critics is the granting of bail. The majority of more than 600 charged so far over the protests have been freed pending trial. This is not surprising. Suspects are presumed innocent until found guilty. If the court is satisfied they will not flee Hong Kong, commit further crimes or interfere with prosecution witnesses, bail should be granted. This is in line with normal legal procedures and has nothing to do with politics.
It is not reasonable to pick out this or that decision and compare it with another. Judicial decision-making is complex, whether granting bail, delivering verdicts or passing sentences. Each case depends on its own circumstances. and requires an expert application of the law. Criticism of the judiciary is often ill-informed and politically motivated. Judges are human and capable of making mistakes. But there is an appeal process to review their rulings and correct errors.
It will take many months for the protest cases to make their way through the system. They will, no doubt, take place in a politically-charged climate. Anti-government protesters are also targeting members of the judiciary, focusing on those who have denied bail to demonstrators. This is misguided. Judges are not members of one political camp or another. Their role is to rule impartially on the law.
The courts came in for unfair attack and abuse when handling cases arising from the 2014 Occupy protests. Some judges were even threatened. Hong Kong cannot afford to go through that again.
It must be understood that the courts make decisions based on legal principles applied to the facts of each case. It is inevitable that some protesters will be jailed, some given non-custodial sentences and others freed. That is evidence that the legal system is working.
Hong Kong can be proud of its judiciary. The courts must be supported and their decisions respected. Criticism should be rational and informed. The city is already facing extraordinary challenges. If its independent judiciary is undermined, Hong Kong has no future."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-06,City gripped by anarchy Carrie Lam warns of 'a very dangerous situation' as protesters go on the ram,1010 ,"
Defiant protesters unleashed chaos and violence across the city yesterday in an unprecedented escalation of radical action against the government and ­police, even as Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor toughened her stance and warned they had gone beyond protests to attack the nation's ­sovereignty.
After calling a citywide strike aimed at crippling traffic and daily business, protesters throughout the day and into the night ­besieged police stations in Tin Shui Wai, Tai Po, Sha Tin, Tsim Sha Tsui , Wong Tai Sin, Sham Shui Po, Tuen Mun and Tsuen Wan, launching arson attacks at some of them.
Police fired tear gas in flash points stretching across seven ­districts, saying they were using ""minimal force"" to disperse ­radical protesters who blocked more than a dozen main roads and three major tunnels, set up barricades, started fires, and ­attacked law enforcers with petrol bombs, bricks and other ­projectiles.
More than 80 people were ­arrested, nine of them in Wong Tai Sin, which was caught up in six hours of clashes between protesters and police, who fired multiple rounds of tear gas and sponge ­grenades.
Protesters again targeted the disciplinary service quarters near the police station, where officers' families live.
In a shocking escalation in North Point, protesters were ­attacked in the middle of the road, in full public view, by about a dozen men with bamboo poles.
They fought back with metal rods and hurled objects at them, later outnumbering the attackers and chasing them into a building on Fung Yuen West Street.
Angry protesters besieged the building, and broke a window of a flat where two men brandished knives at them.
""Hong Kong has been the ­safest city in the world,"" a grim-faced Lam said earlier in the day at her first press conference in weeks.
""But this series of extremely violent acts is pushing Hong Kong to a very dangerous situation; some extreme activists have altered the nature of these [protests], resorting to violent means to express their aspirations.
""They removed the national flag, threw it into the sea, and called for a revolution to liberate Hong Kong ... These actions have challenged national sovereignty, threatened one country, two systems, and will destroy the city's prosperity and stability.""
Lam made it clear there would be no compromise, repeatedly referencing the popular protest slogan, ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times"", along with almost daily violence and lawlessness, as evidence that the movement had gone beyond its original opposition to the now-abandoned extradition bill and escalated into an anti-national campaign.
""Do we have to gamble with the stable lives of 7 million people and the city's future?"" Lam said. ""Our society is becoming unsafe and unstable. This approach, which some people said was to bring collateral damage, will push Hong Kong onto a path of no ­return.""
For ordinary Hongkongers, it was a day to be met with fortitude as trains were delayed and buses stopped on the roads.
MTR services ground to a halt during the morning rush hour as protesters blocked doors to stop trains from leaving. Eight MTR lines were hit hard, and the railway operator arranged for 15 shuttle buses to ferry stranded commuters.
Tempers flared, and at ­Fortress Hill station, a man ­became distressed, yelling that his pregnant wife was about to go into labour and angrily waving aside protesters who offered to help.
Video clips showed a black van ramming through barricades set up by protesters outside the Cross-Harbour Tunnel's Hung Hom exit, and a taxi mowing down picketers trying to block Harcourt Road in Admiralty.
Shops and businesses across the city closed early, and workers were given the rest of the day off to avoid any chaos heading their way.
Airport services were hit hard as well, with about 250 flights cancelled as air traffic controllers called in sick and airline staff joined the strike.
Protesters first took to the streets for what they billed as peaceful rallies in seven locations during the day, but before long it was apparent many were out to target police officers and their ­stations.
They vandalised multiple stations, throwing bricks, eggs and other projectiles at the windows and building fronts, spray-painted obscene graffiti on the walls, and yelled insults at officers who mostly remained barricaded ­inside.
The mobs used wooden crates, branches and rubbish bins to start fires at the gates of several police stations. At the Sha Tin ­police base, the fire became large enough to force officers from higher floors in the building to spray water on the flames.
For the first time in two months of mass protests that were triggered by the government's now-abandoned extradition bill, police fired tear gas early in the day, their patience running low under an endless barrage of attacks and abuse.
At the first of daily press briefings that police will hold from now on, it was revealed that they had fired 1,000 rounds of tear gas since the first clashes erupted on June 9 and arrested 502 people in total.
The protesters played cat and mouse with police, retreating with each firing of tear gas and advancing again, the aim being to draw police out at multiple locations simultaneously to frustrate and wear them down.
Tear gas was also used outside the Tin Shui Wai police station, where an angry crowd accused police of sexual violence after a young woman's underwear was exposed while being taken away by several policemen on Monday morning.
Senior Superintendent ­Yolanda Yu Hoi-kwan insisted ­officers had not behaved inappropriately, and blamed the woman for putting up a fight and resisting arrest.
At the press conference with Lam, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po appealed for an end to the protests, warning the economy was in trouble because of both the ongoing US-China trade war and internal instability.
Hong Kong stocks saw their longest declining stretch in more than two decades, with the Hang Seng Index dropping 2.9 per cent to 26,151 points.

South China Morning Post,2019-09-16,rival mobs rampage in vicious street fights Black-clad protesters inflict savage beating on unarmed,520 ,"
A 49-year-old man was attacked and seriously injured by anti-government protesters in Wan Chai, as street fights between opposing groups erupted in various parts of Hong Kong yesterday.
People traded blows and verbal abuse, with outbreaks of violence throughout the night mainly around North Point and Fortress Hill, where several injuries were reported.
Earlier, there were waves of violent clashes between police and anti-government protesters.
The ugliest incident, recorded on a video that went viral online, showed an unarmed man dressed in a blue shirt and trousers being attacked by a mob of black-clad masked protesters.
It was said to have occurred at about 4.30pm on Gloucester Road, near the junction of Marsh Road in Wan Chai. The man was reported to have confronted the protesters before he was attacked.
In the video, at least six protesters can be seen kicking him in the chest and back, punching his back and hitting him with umbrellas.
The man is seen shouting out and kneeling down, as if in surrender, covering his head with his hands. But his attackers continue raining blows on him, cheered on by others who watch and clap.
At one point, the man appeared to lose consciousness and was seen lying on the ground. A bag he had been holding was taken away.
Separate television news footage showed him bleeding from the mouth.
The Hospital Authority later reported that a 49-year-old man was sent to Ruttonjee Hospital in Wan Chai for treatment. Police sources confirmed he was the victim on Gloucester Road. He was said to be in a serious condition.
There were more scenes of violence last night. A group of middle-aged men, some in white shirts, were seen armed with a folding stool and a sledgehammer at Fortress Hill MTR station.
Some chanted ""Fujian people, beat the cockroaches! Go police!"", using the derogatory term for anti-government protesters. Inside the station, several men in black were punched.
Near North Point MTR station, a man in white was seen ­lying on the ground with his head bleeding. On the pavement near him sat another man dressed in white, bleeding from the mouth. When approached by reporters, he said he did not understand Cantonese.
A number of members of the media, including two Post video journalists, also became targets while covering the violence in North Point. One was punched in the face.
At about 8.20pm, near the junction of North Point Road and Chun Yeung Street, a group of unmasked men confronted journalists and abused them.
Some in the group were wearing white T-shirts, and one of them tried to push the journalists away.
Riot police stepped in to separate the men from the journalists.
With Hong Kong into its fourth month of anti-government protests, there has been more violence on the streets in recent days.
On Saturday, pro-Beijing groups gathered to sing the national anthem and wave national flags at a rally in Amoy Plaza shopping centre in Kowloon Bay, after cleaning up a ""Lennon Wall"" of stickers put up earlier by the anti-government protesters.
Black-clad protesters confronted the pro-government individuals and, as tempers rose, arguments and fights broke out."
South China Morning Post,2019-09-03,Defiant students in show of unity Thousands of youngsters join general strike by skipping class on f,980 ,"
Tens of thousands of defiant ­university students, school pupils and Hongkongers from all walks of life went on strike yesterday, giving the city's embattled ­government an ultimatum to meet their demands or face ­escalated protest action.
On the first day of the new school year, students across the city skipped classes to attend ­rallies, ignoring top officials' warnings, and piling pressure on the government to meet the five key demands that protesters have been pushing for over 13 weeks of mass demonstrations.
They want Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to formally withdraw the now-abandoned extradition bill that first sparked the current crisis, set up a commission of inquiry to investigate police conduct in tackling the protests, grant amnesty to those who have been arrested, stop characterising the protests as riots, and restart the city's stalled political reform process.
The strike was held as police announced that 1,117 people had been arrested since the protests erupted in June.
Police arrested four protesters yesterday morning at Lok Fu and Lai King MTR stations for blocking platform screen doors to stop trains from leaving.
Protesters had threatened to paralyse the railway network as part of their ""non-cooperation"" movement, but were deterred by police patrolling stations.
Officials also ramped up their rhetoric against escalating violence, with transport and housing minister Frank Chan Fan describing protesters' actions over the weekend as ""barbaric"".
Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung left open the possibility of Lam invoking sweeping emergency powers that would allow her to ""make any regulations whatsoever"" that she might ""consider desirable in the public interest"".
""We are studying which laws could render help to the work of police and assist with their operation ... We keep an open attitude about it,"" he said. ""There are certain factors for our consideration. The use of laws must be lawful, ­rational and reasonable. It must be made in the best interests of Hong Kong in accordance with its actual situation.""
Chan said the airport injunction was ""seemingly not working well"" and the government would have to work on its strategy.
The Bar Association condemned protesters for defying court orders and obstructing operations at the airport and MTR stations, warning it would lead to a ""descent into lawlessness"". But it also reiterated its calls for a complete withdrawal of the bill and the establishment of an independent inquiry into police actions.
The strike started in the morning with six students in yellow helmets, goggles and masks kneeling in front of St Francis' Canossian College, the Wan Chai alma mater of the city's leader, urging her to meet all five demands, which she has rejected so far.
Pupils and alumni from Shau Kei Wan Government School, Shau Kei Wan East Government School and Salesian English School formed a human chain on a 650-metre slope leading up to the Island Eastern Corridor.
""We hope more students can be aware of the seriousness of the extradition bill,"" said Form Six pupil Yannis Ho Tsz-yan, referring to the controversial legislation which would have allowed the transfer of fugitive suspects from Hong Kong to the mainland and other jurisdictions.
A school boycott rally co-arranged by youth-led group ­Demosisto at Edinburgh Place in Central drew 4,000 pupils from 230 secondary schools, despite the pouring rain, the organiser said. Demosisto vice-chairman Isaac Cheng Ka-long condemned what he called a climate of fear created by police officers standing on guard outside schools such as La Salle College. Police said they were responding to residents' concerns about safety, and left after checking the bags of alumni at the scene.
""It takes an enormous amount of courage for students here to come out today. Many are here because of the unprecedented violence last weekend when officers beat up passengers at Prince Edward MTR station,"" Cheng said.
He was referring to officers from the elite Special Tactical Squad storming into the station on Saturday night - police said they were going after radical protesters who were vandalising the premises and fighting with commuters, but they were in turn accused of indiscriminately beating people on a train.
Thousands of students from across the city held a mass rally at Chinese University to kick off a two-week class boycott. A sea of protesters in black, many of them wearing masks and helmets, flooded the University Mall, a large open space on campus. Organisers said 30,000 took part.
Student representatives read out a joint statement, declaring: ""We will carry on with our beliefs and continue our fight. Be it bullets, be it white terror, be it the totalitarian regime, whatever ­obstacles stand in our way shall never be enough to break our ­determination.""
Political commentator Ma Ngok, an associate professor at the university, added his voice to support the students, saying on the stage: ""You don't know when you will lose your job for writing on Facebook or saying 'Hongkongers, add oil' a couple of times.""
Some protesters vandalised University MTR station, damaging ticket vending machines and turnstiles.
In another show of defiance, thousands of Hongkongers from all walks of life joined a separate rally that was held at Tamar Park in Admiralty as part of the two-day citywide strike. It was organised by representatives from 21 sectors and supported by the Confederation of Trade Unions. Organisers said 40,000 turned up.
As night fell, protesters occupied roads outside the government headquarters at Tamar, prompting police to use pepper spray to disperse them.
Demonstrators gathered outside Prince Edward MTR station again to protest. Officers used ­pepper spray and tear gas against protesters besieging Mong Kok police station nearby. Dozens of arrests were made.

South China Morning Post,2019-08-23,Sales of gas masks soar as Taiwan stores supply city Some shops in Taipei have run out of stock whil,698 ,"
Sales of gas masks have soared in Taiwan, with some shops reportedly running out of stock in the past month as Hongkongers snap up supplies on the island to protect themselves during protests. 
A sales manager at Taipei-based Ceachain Enterprise, a wholesale and online supplier of protective equipment, said the company had triple-digit growth in sales of gas masks and filters compared with the same time last year.
""We are running out of stock of [one model] and it will take three months to get more from the manufacturer,"" she said, adding that other models that were just as effective were still in stock.
Since June, police in Hong Kong have fired more than 1,800 rounds of tear gas during protests triggered by the now-shelved ­extradition bill. Health experts warn that improper use of the crowd-control agent could turn it into a deadly weapon.
Supplies of gas masks ran out in Hong Kong last month and courier companies have reportedly stopped delivering the ­products from the mainland, prompting some protesters to turn to Taiwan.
""Because demand is growing daily, we finally decided to allow individual buyers to purchase and pick up the products from our company as long as they make their orders by phone a day in ­advance,"" the Ceachain manager said.
Another wholesaler in Taipei said that not many people bought the respiratory equipment before the protests started but sales at his company had skyrocketed in ­recent weeks.
""We sold out of more than 3,000 units in just one month - that's already three times more than we ordered from manufacturers for all of last year,"" he said.
At Fusheng Chemicals and ­Instruments, also in Taipei, a sales employee said that almost everybody who went to the shop bought multiple sets of the equipment, with each set including a face mask, two filter cartridges and a pack of filter pads.
""They told me they need to take them back to Hong Kong for their friends and themselves ­because they couldn't find new supplies there,"" the employee said, adding that the company did not send orders to Hong Kong.
""We have prepared 10 sets for a Hong Kong customer who is supposed to come to get them soon.""
One customer, a 27-year-old office worker from Hong Kong, said he was buying the equipment for his friends.
""No tear gas was used in the last protest but [Hong Kong Chief Executive] Carrie Lam and the ­police have not guaranteed they won't use it on the August 31 ­protest, so it might be safer for us to buy them here to prepare in ­advance,"" he said.
He said he was not on the front line of the protests and had not encountered tear gas, but some of his friends who scuffled with ­police came away with severe coughs and eye inflammations.
""We tried to buy or order the gear locally, but couldn't find supplies in Hong Kong,"" he said.
Huang Chun-sheng, head pastor of the Che-Lam Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, said the congregation had started collecting supplies of respiratory equipment for the protesters after hearing reports that none were available in Hong Kong.
""We have been told online stores like [mainland online shopping website] Taobao and couriers like SF Express have faced mounting pressure for selling or shipping those products to Hong Kong and have stopped the ­services,"" Huang said.
""Some enthusiastic supporters in Taiwan started to donate the products and asked us to arrange to have the equipment sent to those in need in Hong Kong.""
Taobao is owned by Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post.
So far, his church had sent more than 1,000 sets of the equipment to Hong Kong, either through the post or via personal couriers. ""We do this out of humanitarian concern, especially after reports that many innocent people were injured during the protests,"" Huang said.
Beijing has accused Taipei of fanning the unrest in Hong Kong by supplying protective gear to protesters.
This week, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office, lashed out at Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and her government, accusing them of ""playing an extremely ­disgraceful role"" in Hong Kong's unrest and demanding they ""withdraw their black hands from Hong Kong"".
Ma also warned Taiwan against offering asylum to Hong Kong protesters."
South China Morning Post,2019-11-11,radicals play cat and mouse with police Flash mobs trash mainland-linked firms and MTR stations amid,911 ,"
Radical protesters played a cat-and-mouse game with police yesterday as they staged flash mob ""shopping tours"", blocked roads and trashed train stations and mainland-linked businesses amid festering anger over the mysterious death of a student.
As calls spread online for demonstrators to go on mall marches, scuffles broke out between protesters and police by mid-afternoon in at least seven districts. Large shopping centres were soon swept up in a frenzy of confrontations and clashes as shoppers tried to dodge the chaos or, in some cases, joined in to hurl abuse at riot police.
While calm returned to most of districts by early evening, in Mong Kok, groups of radicals obstructed traffic with barricades and started throwing bricks and projectiles at police, leaving the roads studded with blocks. A water cannon was deployed to disperse the crowd in Mong Kok while about 15 rounds of tear gas were fired successively in Tsuen Wan as tensions ­escalated.
Yesterday's mayhem, after Saturday's peaceful vigil in memory of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology student Chow Tsz-lok, comes just two weeks before district council elections, which many fear could be postponed if the violence persists.
Protesters gathered at night outside the car park in Tseung Kwan O, where Chow fell and suffered a severe brain injury, and began a stand-off with police as they pointed laser beams at them.
The violent core began their rampage at Sha Tin MTR station in the early afternoon, vandalising turnstiles and smashing glass doors, before damaging a Maxim's cafe and Maxim's Palace restaurant, overturning tables and chairs and breaking china.
The station was immediately closed, while elsewhere in Tuen Mun, Tsuen Wan, Kowloon Tong, Tai Po, Tseung Kwan O and Causeway Bay, black-clad protesters appeared for flash mob runs through malls. In several places, such as Causeway Bay's Times Square, they found riot ­police waiting for them.
The 24th straight weekend of protests had noticeably smaller numbers of protesters but bystanders in the malls often cheered them on. Protesters, and their supporters, repeatedly chanted ""rapists"" at officers for the first time, echoing an allegation made in a media report that stunned many over the weekend. The report said a teenager had an abortion after she claimed she was gang raped inside a police station in Tsuen Wan. Police said their investigations did not match her accusations but that they would continue their inquiries.
The new chant along with ""Take revenge!"" were the key slogans of the day, the latter being a line protesters began using after Chow, a 22-year-old computer science undergraduate died on Friday, days after he fell four metres in a Tseung Kwan O car park near the site of a police dispersal operation last weekend.
The circumstances of his fall remained unclear but many blamed the police. Some have accused officers of pushing him while others said they delayed an ambulance, charges the force has denied. Police said CCTV footage showed him walking around the car park alone, soon before he fell.
A Tuen Mun resident who was out to lend support to the protesters and gave her name only as Jessie, said the force needed to be rebuilt at all ranks as she argued an independent probe to look into their actions - one of the protesters' five demands - was no longer sufficient.
""It would have worked in the early days because I think it was only some police abusing force,"" said Jessie, who works in property management and was arrested in August for unlawful assembly in Tuen Mun.
The force was mired in another controversy yesterday when four alleged undercover officers found themselves under attack at Festival Walk in Kowloon Tong where protesters had already been damaging shops.
As they backed away, one was hit in his right eye. One by one, the four pulled out retractable batons from their bags. Two months ago, the force gave all off-duty officers the right to carry such batons.
Even though the black-clad protesters were in smaller groups, spread thinly over the districts, the mayhem they caused forced buses to be diverted and traffic to seize up on multiple roads.
In Tsuen Wan, fewer than 40 protesters went into Citywalk shopping centre and began trashing a Starbucks, operated by Maxim's in Hong Kong, and smashed the cash registers. The Maxim chain has been a regular target for protesters after Annie Wu Suk-ching, the 71-year-old daughter of the company founder, lambasted them.
Police also made arrests in the malls, pointing guns with rubber bullets and cans of pepper spray at bystanders. In Tsuen Wan, a small band of elderly men and women, some wearing swimming goggles and wraparound sunglasses, formed a line to protect protesters against the police.
In the evening, about 2,000 mourners showed up at Chater Garden for a prayer meeting to mourn Chow's death.
Auxiliary Bishop Joseph Ha Chi-shing said afterwards that he understood people were emotional, but it was dangerous to think of revenge. ""We shouldn't do things that are opposite of what we want to achieve,"" he said. ""We should first seek the truth, then we should let the judicial system punish whoever was wrong.""
A call for a citywide strike - the third - could disrupt traffic today. Seven lawmakers are also due to appear today at Eastern Court for allegedly interfering in a May 15 Legislative Council meeting.

South China Morning Post,2019-08-27,A shattered district picks up the pieces Tsuen Wan residents and businesses reflect on night of pand,859 ,"
When a police officer fired his gun at 8.05pm on Sunday on Sha Tsui Road - a major thoroughfare in Tsuen Wan lined with jewellery stores and restaurants - not many in the crowd realised at first it was a shot from a revolver.
The sound was similar to the firing of tear gas canisters or ­rubber bullets, no longer alien acoustics to Hong Kong protesters so inured to the physical clashes between protesters and police embroiled in the city's worst ­political crisis since the handover.
""Run!"" masked protesters and local residents, some in flip-flops and shorts, shouted. ""A real gunshot has just been fired.""
The single shot was to deter a mob that had used metal rods to strike a dozen officers who were vastly outnumbered, on a day that witnessed a shocking escalation of violence.
It also marked the first time a gun had been discharged since the protests triggered by the now-shelved extradition bill began 12 weeks ago.
A study of various video footage showed that as the black-clad protesters were charging at police, one officer fell to the ground - and appeared to drop his gun - and as the others backed away, mere ­seconds later, the warning shot rang out.
Almost immediately, five ­other officers had also drawn their revolvers to point at demonstrators, onlookers and journalists.
As in previous protests, the mayhem began after a peaceful march, from Kwai Ching to Tsuen Wan, attended by thousands.
From 5.30pm, as protesters massed and began building makeshift barricades and hurling bricks and sticks at police, tensions rose. By the time police ­began firing tear gas, petrol bombs were also being lobbed in their direction. More than an hour later, police had fired at least 70 canisters of tear gas, 24 rubber bullets and 31 sponge grenades at protesters on Yeung Uk Road.
By 7pm, the squad, which had steered two water cannon being deployed for the first time in the city, had dispersed the protesters - and subdued some of them.
But as the vehicles left Yeung Uk Road half an hour later, masked protesters began regrouping in Yi Pei Square, some 700 metres away, vandalising ­several mahjong parlours and hotpot restaurants with steel bars after prying open their iron gates and smashing the windows.
""Where are the Fujian folks?"" the angry mob shouted.
The protesters were apparently prompted by an earlier bloody incident on August 5, when a group of white- and blue-shirted gangsters, who had gatheredat Yi Pei Square, attacked anti-government protesters with rods and knives.
Earlier on Sunday, several men in blue T-shirts were also spotted hitting protesters on Chung On Street with sticks they had picked up from a taxi parked on the road.
After smashing the glass doors of the mahjong parlours, spoiling the metal shutters of other stores, the group of protesters - many wrapped in masks and balaclavas - headed towards Chung On Street, where they attacked a police van with rods and umbrellas.
Two officers, armed with batons and shields, later got out of the van. Realising they were outnumbered, the pair retreated to the junction of Chung On Street and Sha Tsui Road, where they joined a dozen of their colleagues who were also fending off tens of protesters along the road.
Several fully masked radicals on the front line hit and jabbed fiercely at the officers - who had been retreating - with metal rods, while those behind abettedby hurling projectiles such ashelmets and umbrellas.
During the fracas, an officer tripped over a water-filled barricade and was pounced on by protesters who struck his back. It was then the warning shot was fired.
A middle-aged man, dressed in a vest and shorts and with an umbrella in one hand, spread his arms and knelt before the officers, begging them not to shoot. He was kicked away by an officer. At least two officers were seen pointing revolvers at journalists on the pavement, even though there were no protesters behind them.
As the officers retreated along Sha Tsui Road, scores of angryreporters ran after them. ""Why are you aiming at ­journalists?"" they shouted.
In the aftermath of violence, most shops remained closed in Yi Pei Square yesterday, while others were filled with workers ­repairing the destruction, welding shopfronts and fixing signs.
An owner of a Chinese herbal medicine shop next to a vandalised hotpot restaurant, who only gave her surname Lau, said one of its surveillance cameras was destroyed with a brick. ""Our business has gone down by 50 per cent. I can't even cover the rent now,"" she said. ""And my old customers dare not to come.""
Residents, meanwhile, had mixed feelings about the clashes.
Housewife Doris Wong, 55, said she would avoid Yi Pei Square but still felt safe in the rest of the area, as the violent protesters were in the minority. ""Most of the protesters were peaceful and only a small group of them wereviolent,"" she said, adding thatthe police fired the gunshot only because they were under attack.
Calvin Wong, a 23-year-old student who lives in the district, called on the city's leader toresolve the impasse with protesters through political means.
""The government shouldactively find solutions ratherthan just keep on condemning the protesters,"" he said."
South China Morning Post,2019-10-31,"A tough lesson is coming, whichever way they go University staff will cause offence no matter what t",1872 ,"
Chinese University vice-chancellor Rocky Tuan Sung-chi found himself surrounded by students, some dressed in black, some masked, many upset and in tears.
They demanded that he and the university condemn police brutality in Hong Kong's ongoing anti-government protests, now in their fifth month. Some called him ""a disgrace to Chinese University"" for staying silent, while others pointed laser beams at him.
The October 10 meeting took a dramatic turn when a female student whipped off her mask and claimed she had been sexually abused in police custody after being arrested at a protest.
A week later, Tuan issued a statement saying ""any proven case of improper use of force or violation of human rights by ­certain police officers must be condemned"". He found himself under fresh attack immediately.
Infuriated police unions condemned him for being biased by failing to mention the havoc wreaked by protesters that led to their arrest. Adding fuel to the fire, Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily then criticised Tuan for paying heed only to students' voices.
Former Hong Kong chief executive Leung Chun-ying was more scathing, accusing him of ""cowardice"" and asking on Facebook: ""Vice-chancellor Tuan, are you sure you picked the right ­career?""
The chairmen of the governing councils of the city's eight publicly funded universities issued a statement saying universities should not be dragged into the ""vortex of politics"".
The protests have put Hong Kong's university administrators in the hot seat. They know their students are involved in increasingly violent protests that have shut down the MTR system and left banks, shopping malls, restaurants and public areas trashed.
Students make up about a fifth of the 2,711 people arrested since June. According to other figures, as of October 23, of about 540 ­students arrested, 58 were from Polytechnic University, 57 from Chinese University, 44 from Hong Kong University, 21 from Education University, 16 from Baptist University and four from Lingnan University.
For university administrators, taking their students' side risks offending the authorities, the police and possibly Beijing. But condemning the violence and disruption will anger students.
Unlike Tuan, most university chiefs have steered clear of ­controversy, refraining from condemning alleged police brutality or protesters' violence. Some have said nothing at all.
Yesterday evening, a group of students at HKU followed vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang home after a petition signed by 3,120 students, teachers and alumni failed to move him to address their demands, which included condemning police officers who allegedly resorted to inappropriate violence.
Earlier in July, some 300 ­students and staff also knocked on his door, requesting dialogue. He met them and seemed to ­defuse the situation.
Education sector lawmaker Ip Kin-yuen expects universities to face ""multiple challenges ahead from all fronts"" as Hong Kong's unrest continues with no end in sight. The job for university leaders will only get tougher, he said, because it is inevitable they will be caught between the interests of idealistic students and a management that also has other stakeholders to think about.
The Post put questions to the city's eight publicly funded universities and two private institutions, Hang Seng University and Shue Yan University. The University of Science and Technology (HKUST), University of Hong Kong, Chinese University, Education University, Baptist University, Lingnan University, and Hang Seng University replied. PolyU, City University, and Shue Yan University did not respond.
Students from these 10 universities announced a two-week class boycott from September 2, in a bid to pressure the government into meeting protesters' five demands.
These include the withdrawal of the hated extradition bill which triggered the ongoing protests. The bill would have allowed fugitives to be sent to the mainland for trial, and was formally withdrawn last Wednesday.
Protesters are still fighting for four other demands: an independent commission of inquiry into alleged police brutality; an end to referring to protests as riots; ­amnesty for those arrested and charged; and universal suffrage.
The universities that replied to the Post did not report a big impact from the boycott, although HKU, Hang Seng University, ­Chinese University and Baptist University advised faculties to be flexible in case of disruptions.
PolyU assistant professor of sociology Chung Kim-wah ­noticed a drop in the number of students when the boycott began, but the situation returned to ­normal after a few days.
It was not like in 2014, when students who took part in the ­Occupy protests stayed away. ""At the time, people took to the streets and camped outside for weeks,"" he said. This year has been different. ""This time, the battlefield is everywhere,"" he said.
So, instead of skipping classes, he said, students turn up dressed in black, ready to head out to a protest if needed. Some wear masks, in defiance of a government ban, while others have their full protest gear - including ­helmets and masks - to fend off police batons and tear gas.
Chung said some teachers allow students to record the lectures and share them with friends who skipped class.
The protests led universities to call off some events. In a rare move, HKU, Chinese University, Polytechnic University, Baptist University, Lingnan University and the Education University cancelled their inauguration ­ceremonies, which students sometimes use as a platform to make political statements.
Graduation ceremonies have so far been largely unaffected.
Since Sunday, however, PolyU president Teng Jin-guang has come under fire when he declined to shake hands with students who wore masks during their ­graduation ceremonies. Teng was accused of failing to respect people with different political views.
Similar tensions have also surfaced in other faculty interactions and among students themselves.
Earlier this month, a veteran lecturer at the Hong Kong Community College - a subsidiary of PolyU - was asked to move to a non-teaching role after students were enraged by his criticism of protesters in an article in a ­Chinese-language newspaper.
Chan Wai-keung, who had taught there for 14 years, called for heavier sentences for those who ignore the ban on masks. More than 100 students surrounded and heckled him in his classroom.
Two weeks ago, a Singaporean assistant marketing professor, Tan Yong Chin, had his office ­defaced and sprayed with pro-democracy slogans and messages condemning him, after he told his students not to use their presentations in class to broadcast their political statements.
The divisions in Hong Kong society over the protests are present among students too.
Fiona Chan, 21, a social work student at Baptist University, feels it is important the university takes a position against the police. ""The school needs to draw clear red lines and condemn police violence,"" she said, wearing a mask.
But Nicole Yeung Ho-ting, 20, a geography student at the same university, disagreed. ""This isn't what universities are supposed to do. They are only responsible for our education,"" she said.
She believed each allegation against the police should be scrutinised, but admitted she did not dare confront other students on the issue. ""If you say something others don't agree with, they can get very angry,"" she said. ""I only make my opinion heard through WhatsApp messages, not in person. I'm worried about getting hurt or doxxed.""
Some students also appeared to be stretched emotionally by the protests. Four universities said they had stepped up counselling services for their students, and some were providing legal ­support to those who needed it.
The demonstrations have ­become anti-mainland at times, with protesters targeting businesses perceived to be close to Beijing, trashing their premises as well as branches of state-owned banks. On campuses, this has affected some mainland students.
Nicholas Xu, 18, a Baptist University communications student from Liaoning province, said he appreciated the protesters' views on freedom but questioned their means of achieving it. ""I feel kind of afraid, because they're breaking stores that support China,"" he said. ""If I speak up, I'm scared I'll be bullied.""
The eight publicly funded universities admitted 12,322 mainland Chinese in the academic year of 2018-19 and they accounted for more than 70 per cent of non-local students. The number of mainland students in Hong Kong has been rising in the past five years.
The latest enrolment figures for 2019-20 had yet to be released, but HKU, Chinese University, Baptist University and Hang Seng University said their mainland student numbers appeared the same as in previous years.
Lawmaker Ip noted that students from the mainland might have received different information about the unrest in their media because Beijing has been portraying the protests as a separatist movement led by rioters.
Ho Lok-sang, an economics professor at Lingnan University, feared mainland students would be put off from studying in Hong Kong. ""If fewer elite students are willing to come, it will not only ­affect the quantity but also the quality of our students,"" he said.
Others remain optimistic. Chung, the PolyU sociologist, said the friction between local and mainland students was less ­intense than during the Occupy protests five years ago.
He said the incident which led to Community College lecturer Chan being relieved of teaching was an isolated event, though he wished the students involved could have stayed calm and ­resolved their differences.
Ho Lok-sang, an economics professor at Lingnan University, said the protests might be having an impact on academic freedom as students were effectively censoring themselves.
At universities, people respect freedom of speech, he said. But because more students side with the protesters, ""those who oppose will stay low profile"", he said. ""They know what to do. And that effectively becomes a form of self-censorship,"" he said.
The same pressure applies to professors. Chan spoke of the ""chilling effect"" his case had on others. ""Other teachers and scholars might now be in fear because they saw what happened to me,"" he said.
For those academics who decide to side with or show empathy towards the protesters, there is the fear of a price to be paid later.
An academic from Chinese University's social science department, who preferred not to be named, said he worried the protests might push Beijing to tighten its grip on Hong Kong's universities. He noted how swiftly things have moved for businesses deemed to have crossed Beijing's red line during the protests.
He also pointed to attacks by pro-establishment supporters on liberal scholars in recent years.
For now, some say the attack by People's Daily and others on Rocky Tuan is troubling. It leaves them wondering if a shake-up will happen.
The social scientist at Chinese University said morale was low among fellow academics troubled by how challenging their space to teach and create new knowledge had become. Should they throw in the towel and move to another city, he asked.
""It's all we talk about when we meet up for dinner these days,"" he said.

South China Morning Post,2019-08-10,Police dismiss rumours of plans for mass arrests,601 ,"
Police yesterday brushed off ­online rumours that orders had come from ""the highest level"" to arrest protesters en masse this weekend without attempts to ­disperse them.
The rumours emerged on Thursday after news broke that a hardline top officer, Alan Lau Yip-shing, was being brought out of retirement to help tackle the city's escalating protests.
Posts in online forums claimed the police would no longer try to break up crowds but ­instead arrest protesters right away and charge them with rioting, an offence that carries a maximum term of 10 years in jail.
But Jim Ng Lok-chun, the ­senior police superintendent in charge of operations on Hong Kong Island, said this was not the case. ""I could assure you that the information is not correct and the accusation is wrong. We have always tried to assist people to ­express their views peacefully,"" Ng said yesterday.
Ng spoke to the press after the police force barred four anti-government marches scheduled for the weekend in Wong Tai Sin, Tai Po, Sham Shui Po and North Point.
Ng said the bans were necessary because some protests had turned violent in recent weeks, and neither the organisers nor the police could guarantee public safety.
""These rallies often pass by somehigh-risk locations, such as police stations and government buildings. We have reasons to believe that these locations could easily become a target for radical protesters to attack,"" Ng said.
He also said the police had ­received intelligence that there would be mass assaults in North Point tomorrow.
Ng continued: ""Every weekend, these large public events have turned into violence almost every time. I can tell you, the ­security risk level for this weekend is extremely high.""
The Post was told police would mobilise more than 3,000 officers, mainly anti-riot squads, to strengthen security at an ­approved rally in Victoria Park ­tomorrow.
Police urged residents in North Point and Sai Wan Ho to take safety precautions in case ­officers fired tear gas to disperse protesters who were expected to ignore a ban to march from Causeway Bay to North Point.
Ng gave a resounding no when asked if the force planned to ban all similar rallies and was suppressing freedom of assembly. He pointed out that the police granted approval for rallies on a case-by-case basis.
""I can assure you that we do not have any political consideration when screening the applications. We look at factors such as location, nature and the number of participants,"" Ng said.
""It would be irresponsible for us to approve all applications and leave the protesters to go wherever they want.""
He said the force ­approved some 10 rallies this week, including a silent march by lawyers.
Separately, Lau, a former deputy police commissioner, ­yesterday met five regional commanders - each controlling 600 anti-riot officers who had been deployed since June to ­combat violent protests.
Lau, 57, also held a meeting with all district commanders. A respected veteran, Lau oversaw operations during the 2014Occupy protests and the 2016 Mong Kok riot.
In September, the contract for Commissioner of Police Stephen Lo Wai-chung was extended for 12 months. At that time, one-third of the force's senior management, including Lau, were within a year of retirement.
The extension was meant to smooth a transition to new management, with Chris Tang Ping-keung, then the senior assistant commissioner, replacing Lau.
Sources speculated that Lau was brought out of retirement to take the heat off Tang, now the deputy commissioner, with the police force preparing to use tougher tactics against protesters.

South China Morning Post,2019-07-03,"A plan hatched on the fly Small group took poll, with 80 per cent voting to break into Legco, but pr",1068 ,"
The storming of Hong Kong's legislature on Monday was not a grand scheme hatched by protesters after much debate but emerged from a small group discussion and was executed seemingly on the fly.
The picture of an almost spontaneous action that snowballed into shocking scenes of mayhem and violence emerged after the Post pieced together interviews with protesters and observations on the ground.
Unlike the previous actions of the anti-extradition bill movement, protesters broke into an unguarded Legislative Council on Monday night without first drawing up a road map on their online platforms. Instead, a group of about 30 on Harcourt Road made the decision at 11.30am on Monday to opt for more forceful measures.
A young man in a green mask was seen trying to gather other protesters, some of whom were still recovering from a clash with the police earlier in Wan Chai, to vote on the trajectory of further actions. ""Now, show your hands if you agree to escalate and go radical,"" he asked them.
Most of those in the group raised their hands. When asked if they wished to remain peaceful, no hands went up.
The decision was then conveyed to a larger group of about 200 protesters at Legco's protest zone at noon.
Random members of the group then threw up ideas on what they could do. Five proposals - replacing the Chinese national flag at Golden Bauhinia Square with a black flag, besieging a venue in Hung Hom that Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor was set to be at on Monday night, storming Legco, government headquarters or Government House - were then discussed and put to a vote.
A 26-year-old male protester, who declined to be named, said one proposal had the clear majority. ""Eighty per cent supported storming Legco,"" he said, adding that there was no concrete plan on how to execute the decision.
While some wanted to delay the action until more people showed up after joining the July 1 march, he said this suggestion was rejected. ""They said those who want to be peaceful would only try to stop you,"" he said.
Others also feared any further delay would only allow the police to get prepared.
University student Nick Yeung, 22, said protesters wanted to send a stronger message with more aggressive actions. ""We decided to occupy Legco and paralyse it to make the authorities face our demands,"" Yeung said.
As to why Legco was chosen and not other buildings, he said its proximity made it a natural target.
Yeung revealed several participants raised the issue of legal risks and broached the idea of taking more peaceful actions ""but such ideas were binned immediately"".
""We didn't discuss what would happen if we got arrested,"" he said.
Yeung did not take part in the planned storming and left to join the July 1 march.
Protesters were then seen assembling metal poles and scraps into a metal trolley. At 1.30pm, a handful of protesters were seen charging into glass panels near an entrance on Tim Mei Avenue with the metal cart and poles, while others stood behind in support.
This happened as about 40 police officers - some with riot shields, gas masks and rifles - stood on the other side of the entrance.
At 4pm, half of one glass panel that bore the brunt of the battering was gone, but protesters hung back and did not move into the legislature.
About one hour later, the protesters - now forming a larger group - then went to the entrances closer to Legco's protest zone, near Tamar Park. They broke glass panels and then proceeded to take down metal bars on a gate.
Again, police took no action against this group, which by now had grown in strength, merging with the hundreds gathered in the protest zone.
During the hours of trying to smash the glass doors and dismantle the metal barriers, several protesters admitted to not having any concrete plan. One said: ""This is an outpouring, after peaceful processions proved useless.""
Moments before protesters finally breached the main entrance at 9pm, some tried to persuade others not to enter the legislature. ""Come back! There're police inside and it's all locked down, there's no point in storming! It will just send you to jail!"" some shouted.
But some followed the sound of an air horn and moved inside, before others still broke more glass panels to create alternative entrances.
Some were then seen damaging Legco property, such as portraits of past and incumbent presidents, as well as spraying graffiti on walls.
There was further confusion after protesters found their way into Legco's iconic chamber. Some protesters proceeded to spray-paint slogans inside the chamber, such as ""Carrie Lam step down"" and ""release the protesters"".
They were also seen defacing the city's bauhinia emblem on the chamber wall. While some words on the emblem were untouched - ""Hong Kong Special Administrative Region"" - protesters painted ""of the People's Republic of China"" black. A colonial flag was draped across the podium in the chamber but was later removed.
At the end, protesters left four black and white posters of mug shots and a banner that read: ""There are no mobs, only tyrannical rule."" The four pictured were Lam, security minister John Lee Ka-chiu, justice minister Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah, and police commissioner Stephen Lo Wai-chung.
It became clear the protesters were not planning to occupy the chamber, however, as some were seen calling for others to leave, fearful of police moving in to disperse them.
After rounds of deliberation, four protesters who were determined to stay no matter the consequences, remained.
A masked protester read out a manifesto inside the chamber. ""So far three young people have died for the anti-extradition movement. Our hearts are with our home and we sacrifice our bodies to protect it,"" he said, referring to three people who had left messages about the bill before taking their lives.
The small group were eventually carried out by other protesters past midnight, after the police announced its plan to clear the area.
Baptist University assistant professor Edmund Cheng Wai said protesters who wanted to escalate their actions may have avoided putting them on online platforms, knowing it would not win majority support from the larger movement.
""The escalation on Monday was probably not what most had expected,"" Cheng said.
He said if the government did not change its approach to responding to the movement, the protests would continue to escalate in intensity.

South China Morning Post,2019-09-24,Flash mob stages singing protest at shopping centre,280 ,"
More than 100 pupils in school uniform and local residents took part in a flash mob singing protest at a shopping centre in Wong Tai Sin yesterday evening.
Organised by students from five secondary schools in the area, including Wing Kwong College and CCC Rotary Secondary School, the flash mob at the Lok Fu Place mall was part of the anti-government protests sparked by a now-shelved extradition bill.
""We're here to fight for the five demands [of protesters],"" said ­Angel Lai Hiu-tung, one of the ­organisers and a Form Six student at Wing Kwong College.
""Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor may have proposed a dialogue but we do not think she's serious about talking to the public.""
She was referring to the embattled leader's first open dialogue on Thursday with 150 members of the public selected through an application process.
The crowd sang the latest protest anthem Glory to Hong Kong and Chandelier by Australian singer Sia with modified lyrics that mocked police.
As they sang, a large yellow banner with ""Glory to Hong Kong"" written on it was unfurled from the third floor of the mall.
In references to the five demands, including the setting up of an inquiry into police actions during protests and the government retracting its characterisation of violent clashes as ""riots"", people waved placards with slogans such as ""We are not rioters"" and ""We support police in enforcing the law. Just kidding!"".
They were accompanied by a man playing the harmonica and a black-clad protester on the saxophone. Residents with young children were among those who sang and chanted slogans.
The protest was similar to one held on Sunday night at the Times Square mall in Causeway Bay."
South China Morning Post,2019-10-04,"Enforcing mask law not easy, warn police and legal experts",615 ,"
An anti-mask law meant to deter anti-government protesters would be difficult to enforce in the streets and could be challenged in the courts as a rights violation, ­police officials and legal experts have told the Post.
The government is expected to push through legislation under a colonial-era emergency law ­today, banning people from wearing masks at protests or public gatherings.
A chief inspector who has been at the front lines of the crisis since June, said a ban would ""unnecessarily stir up more trouble"".
""Right now, only when we ­arrest protesters will they remove, or be forced to remove, their masks,"" said the inspector who ­requested anonymity.
""But if the law is passed, a protester wearing a mask will be seen as provoking the police and asking for trouble. This will definitely cause more conflict.""
Another inspector said protesters would strive to find ­exemptions from the ban.
""What if the guy says he wears a mask because he has a cold and shows us a doctor's certificate? We'll have to give him reasonable doubt, and it will take a lot of time and energy to find out if he is really ill or not,"" the inspector said.
A chief inspector who works in a police station that has been ­besieged by protesters agreed that enforcing the new law would be hard, but he said it would also ­deter some from coming out. He said some young people would be reluctant to risk being identified.
""Many of them, especially ­students, feel empowered and confident in their masks,"" he said. ""Among those I arrested, many cried and feared the legal consequences once their masks came off in police cars or in stations.""
The pro-Beijing bloc in the city has urged the government to adopt a law similar to one in Canada that bans people from covering their faces during a riot or unlawful assembly. The offence carries a maximum term of 10 years in jail. However, exceptions can be made for religious or medical ­reasons.
Simon Young Ngai-man, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong, said the legislation could be subject to judicial challenge. He said if the reason for wearing a gas mask was protection, then a law that prohibited wearing one exposed people to inhalation of tear gas used by police.
""Not allowing people the freedom to protect themselves with such masks might amount to a violation of their right to liberty and security and freedom.""
Young cited Article 28 of the Basic Law and Article 5 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights.
He also said the ban might amount to inhuman treatment. In arguing against the possible challenges, the government would have to prove it was a reasonable restriction on rights necessary to bring protesters to justice.
Johannes Chan Man-mun, another law professor at the ­university, doubted whether an anti-mask law would be effective.
""The law also has a problem in assuming that protesters will commit violent acts and therefore need to be exposed [without masks],"" Chan said.
He said enacting the law would be controversial because it would increase the punishments for those who joined protests. The punishment for unauthorised ­assembly, he pointed out, was sometimes community service.
Bosco, a 16-year old student, said the ban would not stop the protest movement. ""We won't stop until our demands are met.""
It would be a double standard, he said, to ban protesters from concealing their identities when police officers were allowed to conceal theirs.
""We will continue to wear masks. Why should we follow the rules when the police - those who actually have power - do not act in accordance with the law?""
Some officers have come under fire for not showing their badge numbers during protests and have recently been seen ­covering their faces more often."
South China Morning Post,2019-07-14,police 'will stay on Defensive' at protests Source says force sticking to plan unless violence break,656 ,"
Police will play a defensive game when dealing with radical ­protesters despite the extradition bill demonstrations becoming more mobile and widespread, the Post has learned.
A force insider said that unless violence was involved or main traffic arteries occupied, police would not adopt a proactive approach against protesters to avoid unnecessary confrontation.
But a security expert called on all governmental departments to join hands in tackling the current situation instead of throwing police into the ring to fight alone.
""In times of peace, police are worth zero. But in times of need, they are heroes,"" said security consultant and former police superintendent Clement Lai ­Ka-chi.
A series of mass protests against the bill - which would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to jurisdictions Hong Kong did not have an existing agreement with, including the mainland - rocked the city in June.
Peaceful marches on consecutive Sundays were attended by an estimated 1 million and 2 million people respectively, while the police headquarters in Wan Chai was twice sieged by thousands of protesters.
After clashes with demonstrators blocking the Legislative Council in Admiralty on June 12 and following an 11-hour assault on the same building on July 1, police fired tear gas to disperse crowds.
Opponents of the bill, which Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor suspended on June 15, have now expanded the battlefield from Admiralty to all 18 districts of Hong Kong.
An estimated 230,000 protesters marched through the bustling tourist hub of Tsim Sha Tsui to the cross-border, high-speed railway station in West Kowloon last Sunday, marking the first mass rally to cross Victoria Harbour.
While the march was largely peaceful, many stayed behind after the procession ended and occupied the main streets of Mong Kok, confronting police late into the night.
A number of clashes also broke out at ""Lennon Walls"", which sprang up in at least 70 neighbourhoods this week, when protesters tried to stop government backers removing Post-it notes with messages of support for the movement against the bill.
The source said the force understood police community relations had chilled and wanted to avoid confrontations.
""We have tried our best to facilitate any protests and will not take action unless the protesters turn violent or occupy major roads as in Mong Kok last Sunday,"" the insider said. ""Hong Kong is not only made of the opponents. How about the road users?""
He also said the force had no plan to clear the Lennon Walls, saying officers would patrol and remove messages carrying personal data of their men. The colourful collages of Post-it notes echo back to the Occupy movement of 2014, when similar messages adorned a wall at the city's legislature.
Following recent fights at such walls in Yau Tong and Kowloon Bay, another police source said officers would deal with similar incidents on a ""case-by-case basis"". In addition to regular patrols, he said officers would be deployed in response to calls from the public.
Lai said the government should adopt a cross-departmental approach to deal with the unrest and to help minimise the community's hatred of police.
""Is it police's duty to remove rubbish bins from the streets or glue bricks on the pavements?"" he said, referring to protesters' use of bins and bricks as tools to block roads and as missiles to hurl.
But Lai agreed the force should change the old tactics of following the protesters closely, as the nature and sentiment of recent protests was no longer the same.
Keeping a minimal police presence could help ease the tension, he said.
""The recent crowds always outnumber the force. Police do not need to follow the protesters all the way, like babysitting, until they get violent. As long as the response is speedy enough, I do not see a problem,"" Lai said.
""If the protesters claim to be peaceful, then the force should trust them and let the crowd finish the rally."""
South China Morning Post,2019-08-01,Gun-toting officer 'feared for life while surrounded' Force defends sergeant who took aim at crowd a,596 ,"
A policeman who pointed a shotgun at a protesting crowd on Tuesday night feared for his life after he was surrounded and had his helmet snatched, the force said yesterday.
The sergeant aimed the gun, loaded with beanbag rounds, during clashes in which 23 other officers were also assaulted and splashed with corrosive liquid, it added.
Police were also investigating an attack near Tin Shui Wai police station early yesterday, when someone in a car with stolen plates aimed fireworks at people outside the complex, injuring six.
Hundreds of anti-government protesters surrounded Tin Shui Wai and Kwai Chung police stations for hours from Tuesday night, with clashes at the latter, sparking the gun incident.
The police force, suffering soured relations with the public amid the political crisis, issued two statements to condemn violence at the protests, stressing it had the ability to maintain order.
The Kwai Chung clashes flared as protesters waited for 44 suspects charged with rioting to be released on bail ahead of court appearances yesterday.
In a statement, the force gave its own account of how tensions there escalated. It said that at 9.30pm, when two police vehicles left the station, protesters threw corrosive liquid at officers nearby.
An hour later, officers were sent to Kwai Fong MTR station, where an assault was reported. When they returned, ""two officers were surrounded by a big group of radical protesters, who hurled objects and launched attacks"".
""One of them was assaulted by many people. In order to protect his life and personal safety, he raised a long gun loaded with beanbag rounds as a caution,"" it continued. ""The officer also had his helmet snatched.""
The officer's personal details and a supposed photo of his family appeared on social media hours after images of him pointing the gun were circulated.
The force said 24 officers were assaulted or had corrosives thrown at them in the fracas, with five sent to hospital.
Those facing riot charges were the first batch of protesters prosecuted since a series of demonstrations erupted in June against the now-shelved extradition bill.
The bill would have allowed the city to transfer suspects to jurisdictions including the mainland, where critics say fair trials are not guaranteed.
The Kwai Chung clashes were followed by conflicts in Tin Shui Wai, where protesters at the police station demanded the release of three men arrested for criminal damage at a ""Lennon Wall"" peppered with protest-related memos.
In a separate statement, police said they received multiple reports of someone driving past the police station and shooting several fireworks at the crowd.
Five of the injured were admitted to hospital and later discharged. Another refused to go to hospital.
A police source said the car's number plate had been stolen from another car.
In a joint statement, the Hong Kong Journalists Association and the Press Photographers Association strongly condemned ""deliberate attacks"" on the press by police during the Kwai Chung protest.
The groups noted that when officers dispersed the protesters, they were seen hitting an Apple Daily photographer on the head with a riot shield, chasing and beating a female reporter from RTHK who wore a reflective vest with ""Press"" written on it, and using pepper spray on reporters.
The associations said officers had ""lost control over their emotions and targeted the press"" on various occasions during the weeks of protests.
They would lodge serious representations with the government and seek advice on bringing legal proceedings against the force, the statement added."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-13,"airport chaos raises stakes Protesters bring international hub to a standstill, stranding thousands",785 ,"
Thousands of anti-government protesters crippled Hong Kong International Airport yesterday and forced the cancellation of all flights in an unprecedented ­disruption, even as Beijing raised the stakes by warning that ­escalating protest violence against police in particular was displaying ""signs of terrorism"".
Air travel was thrown into chaos as protesters changed tactics to go beyond the arrival hall and swarm over the departure hall to prevent passengers from checking in or clearing security, forcing the cancellation of all flights in and out of the city.
""All check-in service for departure flights has been suspended. Other than the departure flights that have completed the check-in process and the arrival flights that are already heading to Hong Kong, all other flights have been cancelled for the rest of the day,"" the Airport Authority announced at 4pm.
Airport officials said they hoped to resume flights from 6am today, after more than 180 departures were cancelled.
The impact was severe on one of the world's busiest airports, which handles 800 flights a day, stranding tens of thousands of travellers trying to fly out of the city or scheduled to arrive.
Many were furious at having to scramble for accommodation or alternative travel arrangements.
Henry Shi, a 24-year-old tourist from Taiwan, complained that protesters were being flippant about their plight.
""The protesters were making jokes like, 'the plane is not flying any more', and I feel that this is a little inappropriate because the inconvenience is something that affects the travellers,"" he said.
""We are willing to accept this protest and bear its consequences, but protesters shouldn't be using jokes to make fun of us.""
An elderly couple pushing a trolley stacked with luggage were cursed at and heckled by protesters who accused them of ""deliberately bumping into people"".
Others were more sympa­thetic to the protesters. ""I am very upset with the Hong Kong ­government's decision to close the airport,"" said Andy Chan, 30. ""We saw that protests have just been sit-ins and peaceful ­gatherings.""
It was chaos outside the airport as well, with traffic jams and utter confusion. Bus and train services were swamped, forcing hundreds of airport staff taking the rest of the day off to walk for ­almost an hour to the nearest transport facilities in Tung Chung town.
Many of the protesters had to walk the same route as well when they left the airport in droves, chaos achieved and mission ­accomplished.
They said they were upping the ante and spreading the word about their plight to the wider world after police cracked down hard on violent demonstrations on Sunday, even storming two train stations to chase after ­retreating protesters.
Many wore eye patches in a show of solidarity with a protester who was hit in the eye by what they claim was a beanbag round fired by riot police, although the force is not taking responsibility and there have been suggestions that it might have been a projectile fired from a fellow protester's catapult that injured her.
Transport minister Frank Chan Fan said the disruption had seriously harmed the reputation of the city and its airport, and appealed to the remaining protesters still camped at the airport to leave as soon as possible.
Weeks of protest violence, including repeated arson attacks on police stations, prompted the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office to characterise it as ""budding shoots of terrorism"", taking its condemnation to a new level.
But police played down ­Beijing's characterisation, with Senior Superintendent Steve Li Kwai-wah saying: ""Based on the current situation, we will handle it as violent protest.""
Hong Kong was rocked by some of the worst violence seen so far on Sunday, with police using tougher tactics as protesters rampaged across parts of Tsim Sha Tsui, Sham Shui Po, Wan Chai and Kwai Chung.
Police fired tear gas at protesters in Kwai Fong MTR station for the first time and charged into Tai Koo station as well, firing pepper balls at close range at the top of a steep escalator as they chased after retreating demonstrators.
They also deployed undercover officers to infiltrate protest crowds and make arrests in Causeway Bay.
While police came under severe criticism, with many accusing them of recklessly putting members of the public in danger, they insisted they were using ­acceptable and legitimate force.
""It is not a firearm and using it at such a close range will not have the effect most would expect,"" said Mak Chin-ho, assistant commissioner of police in charge of operations, when asked about the close-quarters use of the pepper ball gun in Tai Koo station.

South China Morning Post,2019-09-08,Relatives' group wants to provide a bridge between protesters and officers,506 ,"
A group claiming to comprise family members of police officers has stepped forward saying it hopes to see an end to worsening animosity between anti-government protesters and members of the force, as Hong Kong entered a 14th weekend of unrest.
Among other things, it held a rally on August 25 and said it agreed with the protesters' demand for an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality - something the force opposes and the government has dismissed.
Calling itself Police Relatives Connection, the group has been attacked by protesters and been regarded with suspicion by police as well, with both groups saying its activities might be a ploy.
A woman, who called herself Joey Li and said she was an ­officer's wife, insisted the group was genuine and was planning more activities after attracting 400 people to its first rally. ""We want to build a bridge between the two sides,"" she said.
In an interview with the Posttwo days after the masked rally, Li revealed her face and showed us her Police Sports and Recreation Club membership. She refused to be photographed, anxious not to be identified.
Some protesters have heaped scorn on the group on social ­media, accusing it of trying to take the heat off brutal ""black cops"". The force's personnel wing urged officers to tell family members to be wary of the group, and a police staff association warned ­members to beware of possible tricks by protesters.
Pan-democrat lawmaker Gary Fan Kwok-wai dismissed a social media post that said one of the group's organisers, with only her eyes visible in a photograph, was his wife.
Li, who was in her 40s and one of about 20 core members of the group, said she understood how the protesters felt as she had taken part in the anti-extradition bill protests herself and experienced having tear gas fired at her.
What she went through led to conflict with her husband, who has been a police officer for a ­decade. ""I could not help asking why police did this and that, and he would get irritated and impatient,"" she recalled.
Li said she and her husband supported an independent inquiry into the protest saga triggered by opposition to a withdrawn extradition bill which would have allowed fugitives to be sent to the mainland. They were also in favour of the inquiry looking into the use of force by ­police, she said.
""Let's say hundreds among the 30,000-strong police force made mistakes, on top of those in management who made poor strategic plans,"" Li said. ""But tens of thousands of staff would be stigmatised, and the reputation of the force built up over 175 years would suffer.""
She said if officers were free to state their preferences, more than half would support having an ­inquiry as that would provide an opportunity to clear their names.
Police associations have strongly opposed having an ­inquiry to look into the use of force by officers involved in increasingly violent clashes with protesters. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has insisted any investigation should be left to the Independent Police Complaints Council."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-11,"Protesters' network keeps them geared up and on the move Activists deny having sponsor, say online f",658 ,"
When they first took to the streets against the extradition bill, Hong Kong's protesters were unprepared and underdressed, but as weekly confrontations with police wore on they gradually stockpiled a small amount of protective gear.
Learning on the go and admitting the process was risky, protesters involved in gathering resources such as helmets and first aid kits have rejected claims their movement has been sponsored or financially motivated.
Lily, an artist in her 20s, says she wore ""zero gear"" when she joined the first extradition bill protest on June 9.
What began that day as a peaceful march, with an estimated 1 million people taking to the streets, descended into battles between protesters and police later that night.
Six weeks later, during clashes on Hong Kong Island where ­police deployed tear gas, pepper spray and rounds of rubber bullets and sponge grenades on protesters throwing bricks, Lily was wearing a helmet, a face mask and goggles, and her arms were wrapped in cling film.
""Even if you're not on the front line, there's a chance of being ­attacked or injured,"" she said, adding that the level of force used by police had escalated and prompted her to ""gear up"".
On LIHKG, an online forum popular among protesters, discussions about protective gear were commonplace immediately after clashes with police.
Some officers were spotted using a reflective material on their helmets and shields during a protest on July 13. Protesters imitated the tactic to hide their identities at the next rally on July 21.
Some showed others how to apply the material inside goggles.
A buyer's guide even sprang up, complete with user ratings and price ranges for protective gear. The guide gave surgical face masks - commonly used during the 2014 Occupy protests - a zero-star rating.
""They are useless and can only cover your face. Stop buying them,"" it reads.
On Telegram, another popular forum that allows users to remain anonymous, group chats range from discussions about designs for promotional materials to a group for Uber drivers who will take protesters home for free.
Before a planned rally, messages circulate on the mobile application, asking what resources are needed and where they could be collected. With fears that a march in Yuen Long might also turn violent, the list of requested items included walking sticks and pot lids.
Some people also set up makeshift stores selling protective gear at cheap prices. One group, called National ­Crisis Hardware, was seen setting up by the roadside during recent protests, selling gas masks and filters to protesters.
Walter, a recent university graduate managing a messaging board specialising in resources, said most items were donated by the public. ""The reality is that ­resources just appear as many people donate them,"" he said.
During a protest in Sha Tin on July 14, locals were seen tossing cling film and umbrellas from residential buildings. It was a scene Walter said he was glad to have witnessed.
""It lets people understand where the resources came from - Hongkongers.""
Early this month, some ­Hongkongers also donated HK$200,000 worth of food ­coupons for frontline protesters, following reports youngsters were saving money on food to buy protective gear instead.
Surpluses were also stored by trusted parties, such as NGOs and student groups, Walter added. A Post request to visit a storage facility went unanswered.
Other activists volunteered to transport the resources. Kate, a protester in her mid-20s, had been supporting the movement from the passenger seat of her friend's van.
""We never took money and never thought to,"" Kate said, adding she had not seen cash change hands between other activists either.
Protesters interviewed by the Post also rejected claims by the pro-establishment camp that they were backed by ­sponsors.
Lily said she had been buying items to donate with her own ­savings. ""If there is any sponsor, it is my boss, who pays me every month,"" she said."
South China Morning Post,2019-09-03,"Mass arrests of protesters could backfire on police in long run, academics warn",467 ,"
Mass arrests of anti-government demonstrators might help reduce violence in the short run but could backfire over the long term, two academics said.
Lingnan University's Samson Yuen Wai-hei, who has been observing protesters on the ground since the unrest erupted in June, found the police tactic of stepping up arrests had been in force since the middle of last month.
""It appears police are adopting a deliberate strategy of arresting as many frontline protesters as possible,"" he said.
Police held 159 people in ­connection with protests spreading across several districts from Friday to Sunday. In all, 1,117 ­arrests have been made since the protest movement began in ­earnest.
A police insider said the force had taken a harsher approach since the return of former deputy chief Alan Lau Yip-shing because leniency had failed as a deterrent.
""These people thought they were playing war games and were having fun all summer. They thought they did not need to bare any criminal liability,"" the insider said.
""Radical protesters particularly look for teenagers as 'warriors' and brainwash them.""
The source described protesters, aged 12 or 13, wearing full gear and carrying weapons, crying after being arrested as they finally realised the consequences of their behaviour.
He said mass arrests were needed to ""make things right"".
""The age card does not work. Whoever broke the law has to accept liability,"" the insider added.
On Friday, police arrested prominent pro-democracy activists and three lawmakers in a crackdown ahead of a banned major march in what became the 13th straight weekend of anti-government protests.
Among those arrested were Joshua Wong Chi-fung and Agnes Chow Ting, both from the political party Demosisto; Andy Chan Ho-tin, convenor of the now-outlawed Hong Kong National Party; and politicians Cheng Chung-tai, Au Nok-hin and Jeremy Tam Man-ho.
Tian Feilong, associate professor at Beihang University's law school in Beijing, believed the ­arrests of high-profile activists would force peaceful protesters to think twice about taking part in anti-government protests.
""People like Joshua Wong play a crucial role in orchestrating the protests despite the claim that the anti-government campaign is leaderless,"" he said.
""If 2,000 or 3,000 protesters are arrested in the near future, police may be able to stop violence on streets to a certain extent in the short run,"" Yuen said.
""But it could backfire in the long term because the move would anger peaceful protesters, with some of them turning ­radical.""
Edmund Cheng Wai, a Baptist University political scientist, also warned the police's latest strategy could turn sour and breed more anti-government hatred among protesters.
""Police officers are alsoprone to making mistakes if they take an increasingly high-handed ­approach,"" he said."
South China Morning Post,2019-07-18,protesters want to end march at city's top court Organisers calling for judge-led inquiry into use o,763 ,"
Organisers will go ahead with ­another massive anti-government march on Sunday, having secured approval in principle from police who had asked them to postpone it until August due to safety concerns in the light of ­escalating protest violence.
After a meeting with police yesterday, the Civil Human Rights Front said it was now waiting for a formal letter of no objection, the announcement coming before thousands of mostly senior ­citizens took to the streets in a ­silent demonstration in support of youngsters who have been leading regular protests against the government's now-sus-pended extradition bill.
Organisers said 9,000 had joined yesterday's peaceful, ­""silver-haired generation"" march from Chater Garden in Central to government headquarters in ­Admiralty, also calling for an ­independent, judge-led inquiry into the use of force by police against protesters.
A pro-establishment source revealed that after the bill was ­suspended on June 15, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng ­Yuet-ngor's political allies had ­advised her in a closed-door meeting to appoint a formal ­commission of inquiry.
Lam had made it clear that would not happen ""as long as she is the chief executive"", the source said.
The front, which organised two mass protests that drew ­historic numbers onto the streets in June, insisted the inquiry was critical, as it announced details of its Sunday march from Victoria Park in Causeway Bay to the Court of Final Appeal in Central.
""Only an independentinquiry can settle the rifts and confrontations within society,"" front ­convenor Jimmy Sham ­Tsz-kit said.
""The deep anger has ­originated from the government's decision not to respond to ­protesters' demands.""
Sham said organisers had ­chosen the city's top court as the finishing point to underline their hope that the judge-led inquiry would restore the rule of law.
With some users of popular online forum LIHKG threatening to escalate protest action on ­Sunday, Sham was asked if he would urge protesters not to ­remain on the streets after the march - given the pattern of ­violence after past rallies ended with fierce clashes between demonstrators and police. ""I would first call on Lam to respond to the people's demands,"" he ­said.
The front's latest protest is one of a series in the pipeline.
Community group Synergy Kowloon was planning to push ahead with another march next Saturday in Hung Hom, regardless of police objections after last weekend's protests in Sheung Shui and Sha Tin ended in bloody violence.
While the Hung Hom protest would be themed against the ­influx of mainland visitors in the district, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau Tang-wah said the issue could be resolved through talks.
""I hope they will make the ­resumption of peace their ­common demand,"" Yau said.
Asked if the tourism industry would be affected by protests spreading across different ­districts, Yau said the external macroeconomic environment, regional factors and Hong Kong's own development were all causing worries about the economy.
""There has been negative growth in Hong Kong's trade, ­retail and shipping this year ... and we need to be prepared,"" he said.
Separately, Secretary for ­Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah, before embarking on a four-day visit to Beijing, said many people were saddened by the recent ­protest violence.
""I hope people can set aside their differences in views and communicate frankly,"" she said, adding that the extradition bill ""will not be relaunched"".
Protesters are demanding the complete withdrawal of the bill, which would allow the transferof fugitives to the mainland and other jurisdictions.
Last Sunday's unprecedented violence in Sha Tin left at least 28 protesters, police officers and journalists injured. Police arrested 47 people after running battles with demonstrators at the New Town Plaza shopping centre.
There was no sign of tensions easing, as an angry crowd besieged the customer service desk at the mall for the third night in a row, accusing the management of inviting or enabling police to enter the premises to clear protesters.
They remained dissatisfied with mall owner Sun Hung Kai Properties, which had explained did not call police and was not aware in advance of the force's ­deployment and subsequent ­dispersal operation.
In a statement issuedyesterday, the property giant said it would raise concerns withpolice regarding the clearance ­operation.
""[The company] understands police have the right to carry out their duty inside the mall, but we hope officers can tend to the ­personal safety of civilians,"" the statement read."
South China Morning Post,2019-06-26,Lam adamant bill won't be withdrawn Confidential minutes show city leader set on declining protester,661 ,"
Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor is keeping a low profile to avoid fanning ­extradition bill protests ahead of the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, this weekend, but she is doubling down on her refusal to completely withdraw the now-suspended legislation, according to multiple sources.
""It is suspended indefinitely, so essentially the bill is dead,"" one source said yesterday about the unpopular legislation, which would have allowed the transfer of fugitive suspects to the mainland and other jurisdictions with which the city has no extradition deal.
Another source showed the Post minutes from a closed-door meeting that Lam held with business and community leaders after mostly young protesters laid siege to police headquarters in Wan Chai for 15 hours from last Friday to Saturday morning.
The notes had Lam indicating that she would not give in to ­protesters' repeated demands for an inquiry into the use of force by police, or exonerate those ­arrested.
She stressed the importance of supporting the police force, safeguarding the government's dignity, defending the city's rule of law, and embarking on a new start for Hong Kong after the conflicts caused by the bill.
""[We] have the duty to defend the rule of law, and will impartially and fairly deal with the illegal and violent acts committed on June 12,"" she said, referring to violent clashes between police and protesters trying to storm the Legislative Council headquarters in Admiralty.
As for the siege of police headquarters, on which she has not spoken publicly yet, Lam said: ""When police dignity is being trampled upon and authority challenged, society should strongly condemn such acts, and support the police in maintaining law and order and protecting citizens according to the law.""
With various groups planning another wave of protests against the bill starting from today, British foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, former Hong Kong official Helen Yu Lai Ching-ping and a group of local religious leaders and academics were the latest to join the chorus of calls for Lam to launch an independent inquiry into the June 12 violence.
Senior mainland official Li Fei, who chairs the Constitution and Law Committee under China's top legislative body, the National People's Congress Standing Committee, also commented yesterday for the first time on the mass protests triggered by the government's efforts to bulldoze forward with the bill.
""I cannot understand why violence has to be used every time they protest against the government,"" Li said.
The backlash against the government's handling of the bill has taken a toll on its relationship with its political allies as well as Lam's popularity.
According to the University of Hong Kong's latest ratings, Lam's popularity plunged to 32.8 out of 100 points last week, making her the most unpopular chief executive since the city returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
Government officials were ­lying low again yesterday, with sources having told the Post that they were reluctant to provoke more intense protests ahead of a much-anticipated meeting ­between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart, Donald Trump, at the Group of 20 leaders' summit.
Protesters were planning to petition consulates of the G20 ­nations in Hong Kong today in a bid to take their case to the international community.
The Civil Human Rights Front, which organised the last two mass rallies that drew historic numbers of protesters, planned to organise a ""G20 Free Hong Kong"" rally at Edinburgh Place, Central, tonight.
The front had five demands for Lam: step down; completely ­withdraw the bill; exonerate those arrested earlier; retract all references to the protest on June 12 as a ""riot""; and order an independent inquiry into the clashes that day.
Addressing the British parliament on Tuesday, foreign secretary Hunt urged the Hong Kong government ""to establish a robust independent investigation into the violent scenes that we saw"".

South China Morning Post,2019-11-26,"Protesters aim to maintain momentum With eyes already on next year's Legco elections, anti-governmen",832 ,"
The pro-democracy camp's crushing district council elections victory has left anti-government protesters pondering how to maintain the momentum until all their five key demands are met, as they next seek to break the pro-establishment bloc's dominance in the legislature.
Some protesters said they believed the democrats elected on Sunday should lay the groundwork for the Legislative Council election in September next year by spreading their political ideology at district level.
Others thought radicals would continue to block roads and vandalise MTR stations, as peaceful protesters had largely not turned their backs on the movement despite recent violent clashes with police.
""I felt exhausted a long time ago. But our five key demands have still not been met and there's no reason to stop at this moment,"" said frontline protester Wong, 31, referring to demands including the establishment of a judge-led inquiry into police actions since protests erupted in June, sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill.
Wong, a teacher, said he believed radicals would continue to adopt guerilla tactics, and that Hong Kong had been peaceful for the past week because protesters needed a rest.
In Sunday's elections, the pro-democracy bloc won 392 seats, up from 116 four years ago. In contrast, the pro-establishment side secured just 60 seats, down sharply from the 292 they had.
Social media was yesterday awash with posts urging protesters not to be so overjoyed by the election victory that they might forget about their four unmet demands. The only demand the government has agreed to is the complete withdrawal of the extradition bill.
Despite the pro-democracy candidates' stunning victory, their share of the vote was only 55.2 per cent. Independents took 3.9 per cent while pro-government candidates received 40.9 per cent. Wong said the figures showed protesters could not be too confident about the Legco election.
Henry Wong Pak-yu, a veteran protester who unseated the Federation of Trade Unions' Michael Luk Chung-hung in Yuen Long, also warned against being too optimistic about the Legco poll as 10 months was a long time. ""We must keep our fight going before the Legco election,"" Wong said.
Asked about the direction of future protests, Wong said residents in his constituency told him they understood the more radical behaviour was the result of the government ignoring protesters' demands. But even so, residents hoped for an end to such actions so their everyday lives would not be disrupted, he said.
Another newly elected councillor, registered social worker Katy Ng Yuk-ying, who has helped protesters, said the many seats the democrats had won would help them garner support for the Legco election.
One frontline protester, Cheung, 25, said the victory was a ""good way out"" for Hongkongers to take the matters they cared about to the authorities after almost six months of protests. ""My worry is that some of the candidates who won have no experience as councillors, and that officials may refuse to listen to them,"" he said.
Cheung, who regularly takes to the protests wearing helmet, mask and insulation gloves, said he was now leaning towards using peaceful means to press the government to comply with the remaining demands.
He said he wanted to find out if district councils could bring protesters' voices to the government, although he still supported radical elements as people had different roles to play in keeping the social movement alive.
Whether the pro-democracy bloc would win big in the next Legco election was of little interest to him because the legislature was fundamentally flawed with half of the 70 seats not directly elected. ""It does not really matter how many directly elected seats the democrats manage to win next year,"" he said.
Dozens of people gathered at the Urban Council Centenary Garden in Tsim Sha Tsui yesterday to show support for protesters holed up inside Polytechnic University, which has been surrounded by police following violent clashes between radicals and officers.
Among them was a 19-year-old PolyU student, who said he was happy with the election result as it paved the way for the democrats to win all five ""super seats"" in the legislature. Being a district councillor is the criterion to run for a ""super seat"".
""I do think the atmosphere of protest is cooling down, as I do not see any planned for the future,"" he said.
He said he hoped protesters would start planning to help democrats win more seats in the legislature as the pro-establishment bloc would be going all out to win.
He had no problem with more vandalism of MTR stations, adding: ""The election results have proved the public saw that we resorted to violence unwillingly ... I am not worried about losing public support.""
Another protester, Joseph, 26, said: ""To be honest, I do not want to see protest actions going to the next level. There's a huge cost for all of us ... some were injured.""
He said lunchtime protests in Central should continue, to keep the momentum going."
South China Morning Post,2019-11-10,"People want peace, pro-government activists say",399 ,"
A group of pro-government ­activists organised the first press conference of its kind to condemn violent acts by protesters and said that many Hongkongers just want their city to return to peace.
The event, held yesterday, was styled on the citizens' press conferences that have been held by anti-government protesters.
Two speakers, Jacky Ko Chung-kit and Man Shek Fong-yau were outspoken supporters of the government and police. A third speaker, who only gave his surname as Wan, said he was ­attacked in an act of vigilantism.
""Normal people must be furious about incidents such as these ... Anyone with a conscience would never allow incidents like this to happen,"" Man said.
The anti-government protests in Hong Kong were sparked in June over a now-withdrawn extradition bill. The movement, now in its sixth month, has snowballed into increasingly violent clashes between police and protesters.
Man was a police officer and is now part of a pro-China ­community group. He talked about harassment suffered by his family because of his pro-police and pro-government views.
On October 15, two young men wearing masks went to the school of one of Man's daughters, who is a form four student. They waited for her to appear and then poured a box of leftover food, soup and cigarette butts over her. They told her it was because of her father and left, Man said.
""This was an assault and act of violence. She was a child who did not participate in the protests. I strongly condemn this attack and it was an act of cowardice by the rioters,"" he said.
Wan, a resident invited to speak at the conference, said he was the victim of vigilantism by protesters on September 14, when a pro-China flash mob clashed with protesters at Amoy Plaza in Kowloon Bay. He saw a protester wearing a mask and went to remove it. Wan was then surrounded by other protesters and beaten, he said.
""I saw a man wearing a mask, who was really arrogant. He was pointing and yelling at us. I couldn't bear it any more and went over to take off his mask,"" Wan said.
Ko owns a music school and became a ""protector of the Chinese flag"", a campaign started by mainland firm Sina after Chinese flags were thrown into the sea after being burned by protesters.
Hong Kong had been regarded as a diverse, democratic and free society where everyone could ­express their opinions without fear of retribution but that was no longer the case, Ko said."

""CHILE: The president declared a state of emergency as rioters destroyed rail services.
""UK: Curfew was set at 9pm for protesters and a record 2,800 radical protesters arrested only after a few days of citywide protests.
""SPAIN: The president ordered the cutting off of the app Telegram widely used by protesters and issued a no-bail for those arrested radicals.""
What has our chief executive done after more than four months of mayhem? Well, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has done something, like banning the wearing of masks during protests. That becomes another excuse for more protesters to wear masks and cause more destruction across the city. But didn't Apple shut down an app used by rioters to track police deployment after being asked politely by the government and police to do it? They might reactivate it, though, because US senators Ted Cruz, Ron Wyden and Marco Rubio and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, among others, have been pressuring the tech company, just so rioters can wreak more havoc in Hong Kong - all in the cause of freedom and democracy!
Didn't Washington force tech giants such as Apple to leave back doors in their products for US law enforcement and intelligence agents to break into when ""necessary"", however defined? What American politicians call law enforcement and national security becomes persecution and oppression in Hong Kong. Got that?
Many foreign protesters have been celebrating our rioters and imitating their tactics. But sorry, the only reason they get away with it is the sheer incompetence and pussyfooting of our officials; you can't count on that with your government.
Protests, often violent and deadly, have sprang up across continents - in Barcelona, Paris and London; from Chile to Iraq and now Lebanon. You think Hong Kong's unrest may have something to do with this global wave of mass discontent, and the volatile state of the world and its economy?
Compared to the severe responses of many of those governments, Lam and her police chief have been about as scary as pussycats. That's why the protests drag on and get more violent by the week. Yet, Washington picks on Hong Kong alone, accuses it of committing atrocities and repression and is about to pass a law to penalise the city and its government - just to encourage more protest violence."
South China Morning Post,2019-07-22,"As mayhem intensifies, is this the new normal_ With protesters now having trained their sights on th",961 ,"
After clashes between protesters and police last night that left streets blanketed in tear gas and buildings defaced by expletives heaped at Beijing, political watchers saw no endgame in sight, with one warning Hong Kong was entering a ""new normal"" on how it viewed law and order.
An academic also revealed a survey conducted on the marchers who took part in the protest found that 80 per cent of 1,000 people polled said they understood why protesters would resort to violence. They had little choice given the government's inaction, those surveyed said.
The rallies over the now-suspended extradition bill have become a weekly affair but last night the demonstrations descended to an unprecedented level of mayhem as protesters trained their sights on the central government.
Just before nightfall, protesters who had begun their march at Victoria Park in Causeway Bay splintered into different directions to occupy main roads in Central while others advanced ­towards the liaison office in Western district to pelt the building with eggs, deface the national emblem and spray-paint the walls with expletives against Beijing.
The rally was earlier ordered by police to end at Southorn Playground in Wan Chai, but many demonstrators defied the order and marched westwards towards the city centre, targeting not just the liaison office but the Central and Western police stations.
After hours of a stand-off with defiant protesters, groups of whom brandished metal poles and bricks, police fired several rounds of tear gas.
Edmund Cheng Wai, a Baptist University political scientist, ­noted the growing trend of the escalation of protesters' actions, usually at the end of peaceful marches.
""Occupation of roads has become the new normal of peaceful protests as they went on, which is a sign of defiance of law and order,"" he said. ""[Yesterday], many protesters saw the police's demand that the march end at Southorn Playground as an unreasonable restriction.""
Echoing Cheng's views, a government source said: ""Now many people don't see the occupation of roads as a big problem. It poses a huge challenge for the police.""
Cheng said the boundary of what was lawful had become blurred among a growing number of people, including those who were not involved in violence. He noted a substantial proportion of marchers endorsed the escalation of actions in light of the government's failure to respond to their demands, even as they avoided any forceful acts themselves.
He and academics from Chinese University and Lingnan University have conducted surveys on people who took part in the July 1 march, the Sha Tin protest on July 14, and the one yesterday.
""We found that more than 80 per cent who took part in [yesterday's] march agreed that it is understandable protesters take radical actions if the government is bent on going its own way. The findings are similar to those in the previous marches,"" Cheng said.
Yesterday marked the third mass protest organised by the Civil Human Rights Front, following the marches of June 9 and 16, which it said had attracted 1 and 2 million protesters respectively.
While the latest march was much smaller, with an estimated 430,000 people taking to the streets, the intensity of the battles with police heightened as more remained on the streets after the march was supposed to end.
The mayhem followed violent clashes on June 12, when protesters surrounded the legislature, and on July 1 when they stormed the building. Protesters also clashed with police in Sheung Shui and Sha Tin over previous weekends. At least 48 people were injured in the clashes in Sha Tin.
Ma Ngok, a political scientist at Chinese University, said he saw no endgame in sight as he expected it to become a persistent campaign like the yellow vest movement in France.
""The anti-bill protests are spontaneous, unpredictable and will wear the police out,"" he said.
""[Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor's] administration has hinted it would not respond to the protesters' demands and has hoped to drag it out. It is proven that such tactics have not dampened the movement but instead provoke even more people.""
Ma said ordering an independent inquiry to look into police use of force - one of the protesters' demands - might not dissolve the crisis once and for all, but at least it could help reduce the tension.
But Ma said the city was still far from a breakdown in law and ­order as most protests were still peaceful. ""It is still far from what's happened in France,"" he said, referring to the yellow vest protesters who have been demonstrating every weekend for months.
Cheng said the protesters had bottom lines, such as not storming private properties or targeting sellers of luxury goods. ""Up to now, protesters only target the government and police,"" he said.
But he said it was worrying that protesters were now shifting their targets to the facilities of Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong. ""The stakes and risks are becoming higher as Beijing sees such moves as challenges to national sovereignty,"" he said.
Civic Party leader Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu urged the government to respond to the protesters' calls as he admitted pro-democracy lawmakers' hands were tied.
""The pan-democrats acknowledge in this new era of movement, we are not the leaders and politicians cannot take up the role of leaders like they did in the old days,"" he said.
A source from the pro-democracy bloc, who asked not to be named, also questioned what he described as the police's ""incomprehensible"" strategy.
""If they have rigidly ordered the march to end in Wan Chai, then why would they allow the protesters to easily advance as if they are inviting people to breach the line?"" he said. ""Do they want to prevent escalated protests, crush or make mass arrests? We have no idea what they are planning."""
South China Morning Post,2019-07-21,Police hunting hundreds of core protest radicals Police hunt hundreds of core protest radicals,913 ,"
Police are trying to track down more than 700 core extradition bill protesters believed to be behind recent violent confrontations, including bloody clashes in a shopping centre last Sunday and the 11-hour trashing of the legislature on July 1, the Post has learned.
Force insiders said most of those wanted were under 25 and included secondary school pupils and university students.
One source said several had fled Hong Kong.
""They are local residents. Investigations show they left the city to study overseas,"" he said.
Meanwhile activists in Taiwan had earlier said more than 30 protesters, including some involved in storming the Legislative Council building, had turned up on the self-ruled island.""
Among those who have left the city is Brian Leung Kai-ping, 25, who was the only protester to deliberately reveal his face in the main chamber of Legco on July 1, as he urged others to stay after storming the building.
The sources said the core figures had been taught how to use face masks, helmets, gloves and goggles to hide their identities, how to daub surveillance cameras with paint and to use hand signals for on-site communication, making it difficult for police to trace them and gather evidence.
As well as being used to protect protesters from pepper spray, umbrellas served to build barriers to prevent officers from filming them in the act, one source said.
""After attacking police cordon lines, those hard-core protesters normally retreat and use the ­umbrella-wall as a screen to change their clothes and then leave the scene to avoid being identified by police,"" he said.
He said officers had to collect security camera footage along the protesters' escape routes and find images of the suspects when they had removed their masks.
Although police have used image recognition software to track down suspects, the source said ­officers would still have to pore over footage with the naked eye to cross-check and ensure they did not miss crucial evidence.
The Post was also told the core protesters had divided into two groups, one of which comprised 200 to 300 hard-core radicals.
""They are called martyrs and are deployed on the front line,"" another source said.
""They provoke police on site and use force and violent acts to attack police cordon lines and fight with officers.""
After attacking, he said, they retreated, changed their clothes and left before others moved in.
The other group numbered more than 500 people. They were called wo, lei, fei in Cantonese, meaning ""peaceful, reasonable and non-violent"".
""They are not involved in fights or clashes. Their roles are to deliver resources such as helmets, saline solution, plastic wraps and goggles, as well as bricks and railings, to the front line, "" he said.
Calling the recent confrontations organised and premeditated, the source said he believed those behind them had scouted sites and identified the location of security cameras and areas where they could hide provisions.
Towards the end of recent marches, radical protesters usually turned violent, acting by unlawful means to provoke and confront police, he said.
""Normally these core protesters wearing face masks cut in line near the end of a public procession and mingle with the crowds,"" he said.
""Once they reach their designated location, [the martyrs] gear up before charging police cordon lines.""
The Post was told that police were first tracking down ""martyrs"" while trying to identify those behind the core protesters.The sources said the wo, lei, fei group would be the next target and that they would face arrest for aiding and abetting criminal activities.
They also disclosed that the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau and the Hong Kong Island, Kowloon West and New Territories South regional crime units had been tasked to investigate recent clashes.
A series of mass protests against the bill - which would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to jurisdictions Hong Kong did not have an existing agreement with, including the mainland - have rocked the city since June.
Peaceful marches on consecutive Sundays, on June 9 and 16, were attended by an estimated1 million and 2 million people respectively, while police headquarters in Wan Chai was twice besieged by thousands of protesters, on June 21 and 26.
After clashes with demonstrators blockading Legco in Admiralty on June 12 and following the storming of the same building on July 1, police fired tear gas to disperse crowds.
Opponents of the bill, which Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor suspended on June 15, have now expanded the battlefield from Admiralty and Wan Chai to other districts of Hong Kong.
An estimated 230,000 protesters marched through the bustling tourist hub of Tsim Sha Tsui to the cross-border high-speed railway station in West Kowloon on July 6, the first mass rally to cross Victoria Harbour.
While the march was peaceful, many stayed behind after the procession ended and occupied the main streets of Mong Kok, confronting police late into the night.
Last Sunday, a peaceful march in Sha Tin drew an estimated 115,000 people before a confrontation started and then descended into violence that left 28 people injured, including 13 police ­officers.
Since June 12, when police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds to disperse violent protesters outside the government complex in Admiralty, more than 120 people have been arrested in connection with the extradition bill protests, as well as for releasing the personal information of officers online."
South China Morning Post,2019-09-04,App to offer protesters greater privacy Telegram will update security and unveil digital coin that h,886 ,"
For the anti-government protesters in Hong Kong, privacy is a ­priority. The steps they have taken to protect their identities include wearing masks, paying for single-trip MTR fares with cash and using encrypted messaging apps.
Telegram, the most widely used app by protesters to organise and share information, is moving to provide additional layers of anonymity to its users - from a new security setting that would conceal their mobile phone ­numbers, to the launch of its own cryptocurrency.
The planned security update to Telegram would allow protesters to cloak their mobile numbers, preventing authorities from ­discovering their identities in the app's large group chats, according to a recent Reuters report, which quoted a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
The app's new digital coin, called the Gram, will be released within the next two months, The New York Times reported last week, citing three investors who spoke on condition of anonymity because they had signed non-disclosure agreements with ­Telegram. This cryptocurrency can be stored in a Gram digital wallet, which will be made ­available by Telegram to its more than 200 million users worldwide.
These developments show how technologies to avoid surveillance and persecution are not only becoming more sophisticated, but also how there is a broader awareness about the extent ofdigital snooping.
Telegram's initiatives come at a time when local police have made 1,140 arrests since the ­protests began nearly four months ago.
In June, Ivan Ip, who servedas administrator for a Telegram group that shared information about the protests, was arrested for conspiracy to commit public nuisance. The case involved ­plotting with others to storm the Legislative Council complex and block neighbouring roads. Ip said he merely shared information online and did not join the protests.
Created in 2013 by Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov, ­Telegram allows users to search for other users by uploading phone numbers. It will soon offer an ­option to disable that matching system. Telegram did not ­immediately respond to a request for comment via the app.
Telegram has become ­popular in Hong Kong because it allows a group chat to have up to 200,000 members - nearly 800 timesmore than WhatsApp's maximum of 256. Marketed as a secure messaging app, it has an encrypted ­""Secret Chat"" function that makes such messages accessible only on the device first used to start the chat.
First-time installations of ­Telegram in Hong Kong surged in July, when the app gained about 110,000 new users, according to app analytics firm Sensor Tower. That was up from 26,000 usersin the same month last year.
The decentralised messaging system that has made Telegram widely adopted by protesters is also why it has become popular with certain terrorist groups, such as Islamic State (IS), and white nationalist groups in the US.Telegram has moved to shut down public channels thatpromote violence.
The app has also run afoulof certain governments. Iran blocked Telegram soon after ­protests started there last year, while Russia banned the app ­because it did not comply with laws that ­required encryption keys to be stored and handed over to the country's security service.
A larger worry for governments, however, could be when Telegram's own cryptocurrency, the Gram, is made available to its users. Telegram plans to deliver the initial batch of Grams to ­investors by October 31, or return their money, according to legal documents cited by The Times in its report last week.
Telegram raised a total of US$1.7 billion for its Gram, which would allow users to store them in a digital wallet available on the app. Like bitcoin, Gram runs on blockchain technology - a form of decentralised database - which automatically updates transactions across a network of computers. That means anyone who owns such digital currency can use it to make payments or ­transfer money across borders, anonymously. This could also mean Telegram has the potential of becoming a fundraising ­platform for social movements and militant groups.
Some human rights activists said cryptocurrency can help drive social movements andpreserve freedom in a connected world.
""In my view, bitcoin is a similar phenomenon to democracy and the internet, technologies which respectively smashed the tyranny of political power and corporate control of knowledge,"" wroteAlex Gladstein of Human Rights Foundation, in a recent ­article for the non-profit advocacy group Coin Center.
Whether Telegram's launch of its cryptocurrency could help the protest movement in Hong Kong will depend on several factors, ­according to Steven Stalinsky of the Middle East Media Research Institute, which had studied how groups such as IS used cryptocurrency.
""If Telegram is the most popular app that people in Hong Kong are using for communications [during protests], I would expect they would also use it for money.""
Genesis Block, a cryptocurrency automated teller machine vendor, provided protesters on July 1 with water bottles and umbrellas, funded by international donations of bitcoin cash, according to a Forbes report. The bottles were labelled with a QR code that allowed recipients to donate bitcoin cash to help fund further supplies.
Some local merchants have also accepted cryptocurrency since the protests began."
South China Morning Post,2019-11-16,"inside the campus 'weapons factories' Protesters say they have to defend themselves, and hold tutori",777 ,"
Near the 50-metre outdoor swimming pool at Polytechnic University, a thick scent of motor oil and lighter fluid filled the air, as ­protesters practised throwing petrol bombs they had made.
On a bridge at Chinese University in Sha Tin, where protesters had set up a makeshift checkpoint guarding against entry to their campus, bags and boxes of petrol bombs were placed on the ground, ready to be deployed at any moment.
In Pok Fu Lam, at the University of Hong Kong, student union offices were piled high with bags of clothing, food and first aid ­material, but also items such as thinner, oil and lighters. There were notes pinned to a wall showing how to make petrol bombs and nail traps for roadblocks.
On a footbridge at the campus where protesters had set up an ­inspection point, materials for petrol bombs and dozens of finished versions of the explosive were scattered on the ground. ""We are using petrol bombs only when attacked by police. It's the last resort to protect the campus,"" Hui, a 19-year-old student protester - but not from HKU - said.
Such scenes have taken over universities in recent days, as protesters and police clash, with tear gas fired on campuses for the first time. Student demonstrators accused the force of invading school grounds, while police said they were entering to arrest criminals.
Yesterday, the fifth straight day of citywide protests that have crippled transport routes, City and Chinese universities ­confirmed that flammable and dangerous chemicals were stolen from laboratories, raising ­concerns they would be used for making explosives.
On Tuesday at CUHK, officers fired more than 1,000 rounds of tear gas at protesters, who they accused of hurling hundreds of petrol bombs. At the university's No 2 bridge, a chain spanning more than 1km was formed by protesters, who passed petrol bombs and other supplies to the front line.
Others amassed bows and ­arrows from the campus sports ground.
Over the night, dozens of protesters attended tutorials on making petrol bombs, where they were taught how to mix ingredients and which type of bottles to use. Most protesters wore gas masks as they took turns through the night guarding the bridge, while at least three checkpoints were set up around the campus to search bags and demand the ID cards of those entering.
One of the protesters who guarded a checkpoint said the ­inspection was needed to prevent undercover officers from infiltrating their ranks. ""As long as those who want to come in are not carrying any guns or batons, they are all free to visit,"" he said.
A 15-year-old school student, who wanted to be called Nicole, said she had been a frontline protester since August. On Tuesday, she helped make about eight ­petrol bombs at CUHK for the first time. ""We used some [mixture of] naphtha and motor oil, pouring this into a glass bottle till it was nearly full, and then inserting a large piece of gauze.
""When we made these [petrol bombs], of course we wanted to use them. But it's a [defensive] tactic so if police don't come in we won't be using them,"" she said.
Another 15-year-old school student, who had been at CUHK since Monday, said it was ""easy"" to make petrol bombs as there were formulas to follow. Most raw materials including motor oil were either brought in by other protesters or donated by people from outside.
The number of petrol bombs seen yesterday at CUHK was ­significantly fewer, and protesters were placing cling wrap around those that remained to avoid ­contents from vaporising.
There were similar scenes at PolyU, where protesters told the Post there were hundreds of petrol bombs on campus and a security checkpoint set up at an entrance. At one of the footbridges on ­campus, a group of students were making nail traps to puncture car tyres.
Another PolyU student, ­surnamed Tsang, 21, was stuffing a torn-up cloth into a glass bottle filled with vegetable oil and lighter fluid.
But she denied university campuses had turned into what police described as ""weapons ­factories"".
""Making petrol bombs is our basic way to defend ourselves. We cannot just sit around empty-handed while police are storming campuses without warrants and throwing tear gas,"" Tsang said, ­referring to the fiery clashes at CUHK.
""I'm not brave enough to light and hurl petrol bombs at police,"" Tsang said. ""But I do help to make them."" She added that she learned this while watching ­others at PolyU.
""I can't deny the fact that I am afraid of being arrested when I'm on the front line, or if I get caught making petrol bombs. But when you're with others who are also being tear-gassed, you become one with them and push through.""

South China Morning Post,2019-09-26,Maxim's staff given guidelines after outlets are targeted Catering firm also seeks to distance itsel,499 ,"
One of Hong Kong's largest food and catering firms has issued emergency guidelines to staffand apologised to customersafter ­restaurants under its ­ownership were targeted by ­anti-government protesters in Sha Tin's New Town Plaza during a rally on Sunday.
Protesters targeted the ­Maxim's Group after its founder's daughter, Annie Wu Suk-ching, called protesters ""rioters"", and said they did not represent Hong Kong.
""Some reports have said Wu is a manager at the company. We hereby state that Wu does not hold any position at the company, nor is she involved in any managerial decisions,"" Maxim's said in a statement.
On Sunday, protesters marched around the shopping centre in Sha Tin, targeting businesses with mainland connections, or those known to have criticised the protests.
They ­painted graffiti on store fronts and jammed the ­restaurants' digital table booking systems.
Cafes and restaurants owned by Maxim's were adorned with stickers saying ""support high-ranking officials and police"" and ""777"", which ­refers to the number of votes Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng ­Yuet-ngor received in the 2017 election.
The firm owns or operates ­several well-known chains, including the local operations for Starbucks, upmarket bakery and cafe Cova, and restaurants Jade Garden and Peking Garden.
In its statement, the restaurant group thanked frontline staff and said it had issued ""emergency guidelines and assistance"" to ­affected employees, but did not elaborate on what the guidelines included. ""In light of recent social incidents, we hope all parties can ­resolve their differences and the community can return to ­normal,"" the statement said.
Snack chain Best Mart 360 was also targeted during the rally ­because online rumours claimed it had ties to the alleged Fujianese gangsters accused of attacking protesters in North Point.
""It has come to our attention that there are rumours online ­associating our company with the Fujian gang or triads,"" the firm said in a statement. ""We would like to vehemently deny any links to any form of violence.""
The company said it respected freedom of speech and everyone's right to voice their opinions.
Neither company would say how much Sunday's protests had cost them, or comment on the protesters' actions.
Shopkeeper Wing Li, 39, who works in New Town Plaza,­w­orried the protests would affect his income but said he was not scared of protesters.
""Of course it impacted our business, because people usually come out to shop on weekends, so it's a double whammy, but I'm not super against the protesters ­because most them are rational,"" he said.
Some shoppers, such as Emily Fung, have visited the mall less ­often since protests began in June.
""I now go to the mainland or leave Hong Kong on weekends to escape the chaos,"" the 59-year-old Sha Tin resident said.
Zeng Xueying, 23, a Shenzhen resident who works in e-commerce, said: ""I'm worried about my safety. I used to come to Hong Kong to shop every week, but now only once every three to five weeks."""
South China Morning Post,2019-07-19,Rival rallies planned for weekend Pro-establishment camp will call for residents to support police a,722 ,"
Hong Kong is bracing for another weekend of protests with the pro-Beijing camp set to stage its ­second major rally tomorrow to mobilise middle-of-the-road ­residents to condemn violence and support police, a day before yet another massive march against the embattled ­government.
Organisers of the pro-establishment ""Safeguard Hong Kong"" rally steered clear of lending unequivocal support to the city's beleaguered leader, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, only asking people to ""give her more time"" to recover from the worst political crisis facing Hong Kong.
""I think she's suffered quite a lot, and she's been rethinking the way forward,"" said lawyer ­Kennedy Wong Ying-ho, co-organiser of the rally and a ­member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the nation's top advisory body.
The rally was announced as police, in a rare move, asked a small community group organising a separate march against mainland tourists in Hung Hom on July 27 to answer 32 questions on their planning and security ­arrangements for ""detailed analysis"", after earlier protests in Sha Tin and Sheung Shui descended into violence between protesters and officers.
The anti-government protests on Sunday and next week are among a series of actions in the pipeline, including a social workers' silent march from Wan Chai to the Chief Executive's Office in Admiralty on Sunday, and demonstrations in Mong Kok, Western district and Tseung Kwan O on the coming weekends.
Protesters have called for Lam to fully withdraw the now-suspended extradition bill - which she had said was already ""dead"" - that would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to the mainland among other ­jurisdictions.
The issue of violence erupting after protests took centre stage again yesterday, as organisers pledged to maintain peace and order during their marches.
University of Hong Kong president Zhang Xiang had to address the issue as well, at a forum he held with hundreds of students, alumni and staff. Zhang had angered scores of them when he issued a statement on July 3 condemning the violence sparked during the storming of the legislature two days earlier, as protesters felt he was unfairly singling them out and not police.
Zhang's clarification last week that he was decrying violence committed ""by any party"" during the protests failed to pacify his young critics, who have accused police of using excessive force.
In a press conference yesterday, pro-establishment politicians also denounced violence in the city. They said their rally at ­Tamar Park, near the city's legislative and administrative centre, was to underscore and protect Hong Kong's stability.
Starry Lee Wai-king, chairwoman of the city's largest pro-Beijing group, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, urged people to distance themselves from violent protests.
""We respect peaceful assembly and we resolutely oppose violence and extremism, because Hong Kong will eventually suffer from that,"" Lee said.
Kennedy Wong said the livelihoods of ordinary Hongkongers had been affected by protests in different districts. ""We appreciate the passion of young people, but every society has its core values, and for Hong Kong, that's rule of law,"" he said.
The pro-Beijing rally did not include a call to support Lam as a key message.
Asked whether they still supported Lam, Wong insisted that he would not comment on whether Lam had done ""the right or wrong thing"" in the past weeks.
""We should give her more time, I think she's suffered quite a lot, she's been rethinking on the way forward,"" Wong said.
Chaos erupted as tens of thousands of government supporters gathered in the same park on June 30 to show solidarity with the city's embattled police force.
There were multiple confrontations as rally goers got into physical scuffles with small groups of extradition bill protesters.
Pro-police demonstrators targeted journalists on multiple occasions, including verbally abusing and threatening two ­female reporters from the Post, prompting four media organisations to issue statements condemning the aggression.
Wong yesterday said while they would arrange about 1,000 marshals to maintain order at the rally, he could not guarantee there would be no chaos.
""Tamar Park is an open space, everyone can go there,"" he said.

South China Morning Post,2019-10-27,"medical staff condemn the police More than 1,000 gather for rally and accuse officers of inflicting",629 ,"
More than 1,000 medical professionals and their supporters held a peaceful rally in Central last night, accusing police of brutalising protesters, as the city marked the second straight Saturday of anti-government demonstrations without major violence.
Doctors, nurses, health care workers and others gathered at Chater Garden at 6pm for the 3½-hour, officially approved rally under the theme, ""respect human rights, keep police powers in check"".
They were united in condemning police, accusing them of inflicting ""severe injuries"" on protesters, but pledged to maintain their professionalism and treat all equally, regardless of background and political persuasions.
This was the 21st consecutive weekend of demonstrations first sparked by the government's now-withdrawn extradition bill, which would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to the mainland and other jurisdictions. The massive public backlash against the bill has developed into a widespread anti-government movement, which is now demanding action against police as well as universal suffrage.
While volunteer first-aiders on the front lines have been caught in the crossfire during clashes between protesters and police, some have accused officers of obstructing them from helping the injured. Police in turn have arrested some of them, questioning their professionalism and accusing them of colluding with protesters.
Medical professionals at hospitals have also been frequently critical of police action.
""We can see protesters sent to hospital with various degrees of injuries caused by police, like head injuries, laceration wounds and bone fractures,"" nurse Lau Hoi-man, one of the organisers, said before the rally, recalling protesters' complaints about receiving delayed medical attention after being arrested.
""Police have also entered clinical areas and even women-only patient rooms,"" he said after the rally. ""This is an invasion of patient privacy. This has also led to a breakdown in trust in the public health care system.""
Organisers showed photos of injuries sustained by protesters and played a voice recording they said was from an onlooker at a protest who was too afraid to seek treatment at a public hospital after his right index finger was broken on October 20 by a projectile fired by police. ""We were getting dinner at Mong Kok on Sunday ... police were firing tear gas at the time. I had no protective gear so I ran,"" the man said, claiming that he was hit while fleeing.
Fearing his case might be reported to police, the man said, he had his injury attended to at an ""underground clinic"".
Opposition lawmaker Joseph Lee Kok-long, representing the health services constituency and a registered nurse himself, accused police of creating an ""unsafe environment"" in public hospitals where patients dared not come forward for treatment.
""The Hong Kong government has used the need to stop violence as an excuse to let police run amok, ignore the law and beat up protesters with batons. Officers have gone into hospitals, invaded patients' privacy and made arrests in wards, as well as arrested first-aiders and therefore prevented injured people on the ground from getting the immediate medical attention they need,"" Lee said, ""We have to ask, is Hong Kong still a healthy and safe city?""
The city's doctors and nurses have held silent sit-ins at hospitals and put up Lennon Walls of colourful stickers carrying anti-government messages, while pro-police groups have accused them of siding with protesters and condoning violence.
Dr Arisina Ma Chung-yee, of the Hong Kong Public Doctors' Association, said she had faced a backlash from four police officers' associations over the group's statement condemning the shooting of an 18-year-old man in the chest with a live round in Tsuen Wan."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-07,"Rethink strategy for movement, pan-dems urge They say another strike will work better than more conf",685 ,"
Pan-democrat legislators have called on some of the more radical protesters in the leaderless anti-extradition movement to calm down and rethink their strategy, or risk playing into the government's hands.
NeoDemocrat lawmaker Gary Fan Kwok-wai also accused the government of fuelling the clashes between residents from both sides by branding the protests a separatist movement.
He was speaking a day after Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said in a press conference that the protesters were now calling for a revolution to liberate Hong Kong, which threatened national sovereignty.
""All of this is trying to justify the violent crackdown by police,"" he said. ""The protesters' attempts to besiege police stations or confront officers will definitely weaken the movement and even fall into the government's trap.""
Protesters in the movement unleashed chaos in an unprecedented citywide rampage on Monday. In addition to a mass strike, protesters besieged police stations in Tin Shui Wai, Tai Po, Sha Tin, Tsim Sha Tsui, Wong Tai Sin, Sham Shui Po, Tuen Mun and Tsuen Wan, launching arson attacks at some of them.
Fan believed that another strike like Monday's would work better than confrontations with police.
IT lawmaker Charles Mok, of the Professionals Guild, agreed that besieging police stations was a dangerous move, saying it was important for the movement to maintain widespread support.
""We should not fall into the trap of the local and central governments. They want to see this happen so we lose public support,"" he said.
Meanwhile, a local feminist who planned a peaceful demonstration in Tin Shui Wai found herself the target of accusations by online activists after dozens of protesters were arrested at the scene on Monday night.
Petula Ho Sik-ying, social work professor at the University of Hong Kong and co-founder of online platform Gender and Sexual Justice in Action, called for a protest at 1pm on Monday against the arrest of a female protester who was photographed with her dress pulled up and underwear exposed when police dragged her away, an act demonstrators called a sexual assault.
Police later insisted officers had not behaved inappropriately, and blamed the woman for putting up a fight and resisting arrest.
During the demonstration on Monday, riot police suddenly charged into the crowd and start arresting protesters outside the station.
An online post on LIHKG blamed Ho for telling protesters ""to hold firm and stand there like a peaceful gathering, but she was later let go while protesters and citizens were arrested"" - an accusation Ho rejected.
Following the arrests, police fired rounds of tear gas at about 2.40pm to disperse the crowds. Protesters fled, with some throwing smoking canisters back towards police lines. The violent stand-off continued late into the night, when 82 protesters were arrested.
Ho rejected the accusation that her appeal for a peaceful protest had led to the arrests.
""I did not ask anyone to stand there and wait for the police to arrest them,"" she said. ""It was so sudden when the riot police rushed out to arrest the black-clad protesters, who had done nothing.""
She also noted the leaderless movement was different from the Occupy movement five years ago, which was mainly led by student leaders and scholars who advocated peaceful protest. ""To sit down [and remain peaceful] was the approach [then]. But now, am I crazy to ask the protesters to sit down?"" she asked.
""We can't even escape from [police]. How would I ask people to stay there to wait for police to arrest them? We have to 'be water', meaning move around!""
But since the online accusation, Ho was subjected to a certain degree of harassment. Yesterday, while in Jordan, she was approached and scolded by an unknown woman. After that, a photo of her was posted on Facebook exposing her location, with a message asking people to confront her.
""I understand the frustration and anger of seeing so many people arrested in Tin Shui Wai. I also understand that people need an outlet to release their emotions, but they should not hunt me down,"" Ho said.

South China Morning Post,2019-07-04,Police track down protesters involved in mayhem,696 ,"
Police are trying to track down hundreds of protesters who stormed and vandalised the city's legislature and are preparing to launch raids to arrest dozens who have ­already been identified, the Post learned yesterday.
To locate the suspects, officers from the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau and Identification Bureau have worked for two days with government forensic experts at the Legislative Council building that was trashed on Monday.
""Thousands of pieces of ­evidence including helmets, face masks and iron bars have been collected from the Legco complex [on Tuesday and Wednesday],"" one law enforcement source said.
""Our experts will collect fingerprints from the evidence and carry out DNA tests on the evidence such as face masks.""
Another source said dozens of suspects have been identified and the wave of arrests would come ""in the near future"". He said police would seek legal advice from the Department of Justice before ­arresting and charging suspects. ""In addition to offences such as criminal damage and theft, riot ­offences will also be considered,"" the source said.
He said officers from the ­Organised Crime and Triad Bureau would work with other criminal units, to track down protesters who smashed into the Legco building and vandalised its interior, including the main chamber.
On Monday, about 10 protesters were detained after they charged police lines in Wan Chai before the annual flag-raising ­ceremony to commemorate the handover of Hong Kong. to ­Chinese sovereignty.
""They were arrested for unlawful assembly, possession of weapons and assaulting police,"" another source said. The ­suspects, who were protesting against the government's handling of the now-suspended ­extradition bill, were released on bail pending for further ­investigation.
Police also arrested the driver of a van suspected to have been hired to deliver helmets, goggles, face masks and gloves to the demonstrators.
The 35-year-old man's vehicle was among several delivery vans parked outside Sun Yat Sen ­Memorial Park at about 3am on Tuesday when police responded to a 999 emergency call.
The man was arrested about three hours after riot police fired tear gas to disperse thousands of protesters outside the city's legislature and government headquarters in Admiralty.
A police source made it clear that the man was not arrested for delivering helmets and other gear to the protesters. ""The man was arrested because weapons such as box cutters were seized along with controlled drugs in his ­vehicle,"" he said.
The man was granted bail and required to report to police this month. Detectives from Hong Kong Island regional intelligence unit were following up the case.
The other drivers were allowed to leave after police recorded their personal information.
At about 4am on Monday, hundreds of young protesters dashed onto Lung Wo Road, Tim Mei Avenue and Harcourt Road in Admiralty, setting up road blocks. At the same time, protesters stole iron poles and bricks from nearby construction site.
Clashes near the venue of the flag-raising ceremony started at about 7.30am when protesters ­attacked police lines, hurling ­objects including metal barriers and random objects.
Police fought them off with batons and pepper spray, ­dispersing the mob and arresting aggressive protesters.
From 1pm on Monday, ­protesters used a metal cart to smash through the legislature's glass door. For about eight hours, they also used metal bars to pummel the building's windows and doors while nearly 1,000 officers in riot gear stood guard inside.
The police retreated when protesters finally broke in at about 9pm, allowing the mob to tear down the portraits of political leaders, spray slogans on the walls and smash furniture.
At around midnight, about 3,000 officers in riot gear ­dispersed thousands of protesters gathered outside the government complex. The operation lasted for about an hour, during which no arrests were made.
Police leaders have promised to bring protesters, who broke the law, to justice.
At least 91 people were arrested over the Mong Kok riot in 2016. The courts prosecuted 64 of those cases and three suspects absconded, including former localist leader Ray Wong Toi-yeung."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-12,tear gas fired inside train station for the first time Police step up use of force as city is wracke,952 ,"
Police fired tear gas at protesters in an enclosed train station for the first time, stepping up the use of force, as Hong Kong was rocked by another weekend of violent anti-government demonstrations across multiple districts.
Casualties were reported on both sides as parts of Tsim Sha Tsui, Sham Shui Po, Wan Chai and Kwai Chung became smoking war zones once again yesterday, with protesters continuing their new hit-and-run strategy to stay one step ahead of police who responded to bricks and petrol bombs with barrages of tear gas and baton charges.
The ground-level concourse of the Kwai Fong MTR station was filled with smoke as riot police first fired tear gas into the premises at retreating protesters, then stormed inside and opened fire again.
The protesters had been heading towards the Kwai Chung ­Police Station nearby for another flash mob-style siege when they were driven back.
Tear gas was used after multiple warnings and MTR ­announcements that the station was closed and trains would not be stopping at Kwai Fong, except for additional ones arranged to pick up people already inside. A man in protest gear was seen lying on the platform, with blood running from his nose, while other protesters were helping him. ­Video footage also showed a stationary train at a platform with people still inside.
There was more trouble later at Tai Koo station, with riot police charging inside to grab protesters who had been moving from one station to another. Video footage showed officers at the top of a long, running escalator beating protesters down, while tear gas fumes filled the air.
One of those who fell to the ground during the skirmish was an elderly woman who has become a prominent fixture with her British flag at anti-government rallies that first began more than two months ago, triggered by the government's now-abandoned extradition bill.
Tensions remained high in North Point, a potentially dangerous flashpoint where hundreds from the city's close-knit Fujianese community, bolstered by clan reinforcements from the mainland and the Philippines, waited to confront any protester arriving in the neighbourhood.
But with police out in force and protesters staying away from North Point, there were only ­isolated incidents of Fujianese becoming belligerent and attacking some passers-by and journalists.
The tourist hub of Tsim Sha Tsui became a battlefield again as the police station came under attack for the second straight day, with protesters lobbing petrol bombs over the barriers protecting the building front.
Police fired tear gas at them from inside, and at one point at night, anti-riot officers from the Special Tactical Squad charged out to disperse protesters attacking them from the Park Lane Shopper's Boulevard, where they had blocked a key thoroughfare - the section of Nathan Road between Austin and Salisbury roads.
The Raptors, as officers from the squad are known, beat ­protesters with batons and made several arrests.
A female protester was treated by paramedics at the scene, her face bleeding after she was hit by a beanbag round, according to ­witnesses.
A policeman inside the station suffered burns to his legs after being hit by a petrol bomb.
The clashes intensified at night after a day of confrontations that mostly saw protesters blocking roads and engaging police in stand-offs, only to retreat and strike at the next location when ­officers fired tear gas or charged at them.
Protesters wearing gas masks and helmets were seen regularly darting across roads to pick up smoking canisters and throw them back at police with well-practised ease.
Yesterday's protests came after police rejected organisers' applications to host marches in Sham Shui Po, and from Causeway Bay to North Point, citing safety concerns.
Sham Shui Po and North Point had been on high alert since morning, with shops closed as the protesters were expected to march in defiance of the police bans.
The crowds gathered at the Maple Street Playground in Sham Shui Po and across the harbour at Victoria Park at about 2pm.
Those in Sham Shui Po marched towards Cheung Sha Wan and the local police station at about 3pm, while those at ­Victoria Park, who had permission only to remain there, headed out to take over roads in Causeway Bay and Wan Chai, throwing traffic into chaos.
One group also went to Golden Bauhinia Square in Wan Chai, and sprayed anti-China ­slogans on the base of the showpiece statue that is a popular tourist attraction for visitors from the mainland.
Others gathered at the junction between Lockhart Road and Fenwick Street at night, just a block away from police headquarters, which was heavily guarded by riot police and protected by water-filled barriers.
Police fired tear gas to disperse the protesters, who hurled petrol bombs in their direction.
In Causeway Bay, several protesters complained to the media that they were being arrested by police officers disguised as demonstrators.
Television footage showed several masked men dressed in black working together with uniformed police.
Despite the escalating confrontations, pro-Beijing politicians noted that the number of protesters on the streets appeared to be diminishing in general.
""It has become repetitive, so some of their supporters are tired of that ... The police are also ­making better plans, as it has become meaningless to engage in long stand-offs with smaller groups of protesters,"" National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee member Tam Yiu-chung said.
Fellow NPC delegate Maggie Chan Man-ki suggested the wider public was distancing itself from the violence. Warnings from Beijing as well as riot charges against those arrested were also having a deterrent effect, she said.

South China Morning Post,2019-09-24,Pupils make voices heard with rendition of anthem First student-led production of protest song is co,509 ,"
When Peter (not his real name) saw news reports of a young ­protester seriously injured in her right eye amid clashes between anti-government demonstrators and police on August 11, his heart sank.
""I was at the protest that day as a paramedic, and saw her earlier giving first aid to injured protesters. It could well have happened to me,"" the 15-year-old said.
Police have been accused of firing a beanbag round at the woman, but the force has rebutted this, with both sides locked in a legal battle for access to her hospital records.
Peter, who does not want to be identified, also recalled once treating a journalist who was wearing a press vest and covered in pepper spray.
""I'm worried about being in police's line of fire despite my attire identifying me as first aid personnel in the field,"" he said.
The intense emotions felt by Peter, who started out as a protester, led him to find his voice as part of the first student-led production of Glory to Hong Kong, a song composed by an internet user in August that has since become the anthem for the movement.
In the music video to be ­released today that was sung, directed and edited by about 20 masked students from St Paul's College in the Mid-Levels, Peter starred as a first-aider at major protest sites, while two other students John and Joseph (not their real names) played a ""radical"" and ""peaceful"" protester respectively.
In just one week and with the help of some alumni, the student musicians recorded the song - ­adapted for a three-part boys' choir with tenor, baritone and bass - at a studio in San Po Kong.
The team hopes their production can go viral, much like a professional music video done by 150 masked musicians and released on YouTube two weeks ago.
Video director and Form Six student Desmond Lau Kin-hei said he cast the students in their real-life roles in the protest so they could tell their personal stories to Hongkongers.
""We want to lead by example and hit back at derogatory labels like 'rubbish youth' that were thrown at young protesters,"" Lau said, referring to statements by top officials including Chief ­Executive Carrie Lam Cheng ­Yuet-ngor that described protesters as having ""no stake"" in society.
Form Six student Joseph joined the project and took up the role as a peaceful protester in the video because he believed in the importance of getting his message out. He attended only the lawful marches in June and July, and spent his summer holiday mostly writing long articles and promotional materials online.
""I was deeply moved when a classmate told me how he read one of my articles on the justified use of an appropriate degree of violence by radical protesters,"" ­Joseph said.
Form Five student John, who played the part of a radical protester, said the most extreme thing he did was to build barricades and roadblocks by removing roadside metal railings with a screwdriver. ""I know I won't stand on the front line because of the danger of being arrested, but I can still help where I can, including with this music production, which is a form of closure for me."""
South China Morning Post,2019-06-28,Condemnation for treatment of news cameraman at protest,265 ,"
Journalist groups yesterday condemned extradition bill protesters for harassing a television news cameraman covering their rally outside the justice minister's office compound.
The TVB cameraman was filming the protest outside Justice Place in Central yesterday afternoon when footage seemed to show a young protester shining a flashlight in his eyes and into the camera lens. Footage by another online news outlet showed a second demonstrator using a yellow umbrella to block the cameraman's lens while other protesters heckled him.
As the cameraman was led away, some protesters were heard chanting: ""Get away, rubbish. Why film us?""
The Hong Kong Journalists Association criticised the protesters for a ""serious infringement of press freedom"". ""We appeal to the people to express views in a rational manner and not to obstruct media reporting, and also to respect the reporting rights of journalists,"" it said in a statement.
The TVB network has been unpopular with some activists because the station's news coverage was perceived to be too conservative.
In a statement, the TVB news department expressed ""extreme regret"" over the treatment of its cameraman and urged Hongkongers not to ""obstruct the normal reporting by frontline reporters"". The station said its news reporting had been impartial, professional and objective.
The Hong Kong News Executives' Association ""strongly condemned"" the incident. ""Protesters should not treat reporters roughly when they are performing their duty,"" it said.
Some protesters at the rally were reported to have later apologised to the cameraman.

South China Morning Post,2019-07-19,Fences and bus stops gone before march Street furniture removed is similar to that previously used b,351 ,"
Fences and bus stop poles of the sort used by protesters to occupy thoroughfares in recent protests have been removed from ­roadsides in an area of Hong Kong Island ahead of another major ­extradition bill march on Sunday.
A small section of iron fences on Gloucester Road, in front of The Park Lane Hong Kong hotel and Victoria Park in Causeway Bay, was removed, with orange barricade tape left in its stead, stretching for about 100 metres.
A hotel staff said the fences were removed yesterday morning. While some activists believe the fences were removed to prevent protesters from using them as barricades, a police source said it was standard procedure to ­facilitate mass events.
""We do it from time to time whenever there is a mass rally. We removed the fences to widen the roads,"" he said.
It was unclear if more fences would be removed.
A spokesman for New World First Bus and Citybus said some bus stop poles were removed in light of the upcoming protests. ""For safety reasons, some ­movable bus stops have been temporarily taken away to avoid possible injury,"" he said.
The moves came after the Civil Human Rights Front announced details of its march on Sunday from Victoria Park to the Court of Final Appeal in Central.
The city has seen at least seven mass rallies since June. Protesters have removed rubbish bins, railings and road signs and used them as roadblocks or thrown them at police officers.
A police spokesman said in case of a large-scale public order event on Hong Kong Island, it would adopt crowd management measures in certain sections of roads and demand assistance from other government ­departments.
Steve Vickers, CEO of a risk consultancy firm and former head of the police's Criminal Intelligence Bureau, warned that the public order situation would probably worsen in the coming weeks.
""Protesting in locales such as Mong Kok or Yau Ma Tei only adds to the threat of violence, given the population density and the presence of triad societies - who may act as agitators for either side, or simply take actions to ­protect their own interests,"" he said.

South China Morning Post,2019-09-09,Lennon Walls and human chains link HK protesters to Europe in cold war,728 ,"
Decades after the struggle against Soviet rule in Central and Eastern Europe reached its climax, Hong Kong's protest movement is drawing inspiration from the ­people who helped bring that era to an end.
Thirty years after a wave of peaceful protests proved the last straw for communist rule in Eastern Europe and rattled the Communist Party of China so badly it sent troops to crack down on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, support for Hong Kong's protests has been strong in the former Soviet bloc.
While many of the city's pro-democracy protesters took inspiration from the Occupy campaigns of 2014, the colourful mosaics of handwritten protest notes that sprang up on walls across the city recalled an era that had passed before many of the demonstrators were born.
These so-called Lennon Walls first appeared in Prague in ­December 1980 after the murder of John Lennon and evolved into a forum for protests in communist-ruled Czechoslovakia.
""It is very easy for people in Central and Eastern Europe to see Hong Kong's struggle as striving for democracy [with] small Hong Kong standing against a great communist power,"" said Richard Turcsanyi, a researcher at the Central European Institute of Asian Studies at Palacky University Olomouc in the Czech ­Republic.
""This makes people think, 'This is just the kind of thing we did in the past'.""
Another inspiration from cold war Eastern Europe was the series of human chains known as the ""Hong Kong Way"". These were formed to mark the 30th anniversary of the Baltic Way on August 23, 1989, when the people of ­Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - then part of the Soviet Union - linked hands across the three ­republics in a show of peaceful opposition to Moscow's rule.
This example not only added another dimension to Hong Kong protests, Turcsanyi said, but changed the dynamic between the Baltic nations, Beijing and Hong Kong as Europeans sided with the city's protesters.
In Eastern Europe, support for Hong Kong has led to diplomatic tensions. Last week, Lithuania's foreign ministry summoned ­Chinese ambassador Shen Zhifei to answer allegations that his staff interfered in an event in ­Vilnius held in support of Hong Kong ­protesters on the ­anniversary of the Baltic Way ­protests.
Hundreds of Lithuanians joined hands in solidarity with the protesters, while pro-Beijing counterprotesters gathered at the scene, shouting: ""Hong Kong is part of China"".
A member of Lithuania's parliament claimed he saw Shen there, giving directions to the pro-Beijing chorus.The Chinese ­foreign ministry said its diplomats did not violate local laws and followed the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.
In Estonia, an article by ­Chinese ambassador Li Chao ­appeared in the Postimees news­paper to ""help Estonian people better understand the current situation in Hong Kong"".
Turcsanyi said Beijing's efforts to control the Hong Kong debate in Eastern Europe through its ­diplomats was perhaps as important to the host countries as it was in China, but the approach was likely to backfire.
""Perhaps ironically, but not unexpectedly, the heavy-handed approach is more counterproductive than not and makes China seem even more similar to Russia and its disinformation activities in the aftermath of the Crimea annexation,"" he said.
Last month, Czech Senator Pavel Fischer tweeted that peaceful protests in Hong Kong ""evoked the spirit of the Prague Spring of 1968"" - an uprising against Soviet rule that was ended by 500,000 Warsaw Pact troops and the crushing of Alexander Dubcek's reformist administration.
China's embassy in Prague responded in a statement: ""Hong Kong is Chinese Hong Kong. The Chinese government will never allow foreign forces to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs, and will never allow any foreign forces to cause chaos in Hong Kong.""
""I do believe that worries about the Soviet Union's collapse are in the minds of leaders in Beijing,"" Turcsanyi said. ""The Baltic Way replay in Hong Kong was certainly not overlooked.""
Martin Hala, a director of ­Sinopsis, a Prague-based project that tracks China's impact around the world, said: ""China could easily suppress the demonstrations in Hong Kong by overwhelming military force, just like the Warsaw Pact did in Czechoslovakia in 1968. But that eventually turned out to be a pyrrhic victory which contributed to the Soviet Union's collapse 20 years later."""
South China Morning Post,2019-07-31,"Protesters step up pressure with commuter chaos 'Non-cooperation movements' cause delays and jams, w",635 ,"
Commuters are bracing for more travel chaos following an ­escalation of ""non-cooperation movements"" by protesters on train services as ­thousands ­yesterday struggled to find their way to work across swathes of the city.
Demonstrators, angry at Beijing's response to the extradition bill crisis, prevented trains from leaving Tiu Keng Leng and North Point MTR stations during the morning peak period.
The blockade lasted for more than three hours across different stations and lines, sparking mixed reactions from passengers.
The next major protest would be on Monday, as protesters called for a citywide strike across all sectors.
In the first bout of direct action yesterday, demonstrators prevented a Whampoa-bound train from departing Tiu Keng Leng station at 7.50am by standing in groups between doors. It finally left at 9am. Tiu Keng Leng station sits on the Kwun Tong and Tseung Kwan O lines, connecting the densely populated east of ­Kowloon with business and shopping hubs.
At Admiralty, about 25 protesters wearing masks stopped train doors closing from around 9.30am. Some services were also later suspended between Causeway Bay and Tai Koo.
A scuffle broke out briefly between a passenger and protester on the train. The passenger was taken away by police. An elderly woman was also seen being escorted from the train, with protesters shouting apologies.
At the height of the disruption, traffic was jammed on roads across Hong Kong Island. Long queues of buses were moving slowly along the Island Eastern Corridor and Connaught Road from Central to Causeway Bay.
Appealing to protesters, Alan Cheng Kwan-hing, the MTR Corporation's general manager for special duties, said: ""We understand some people want to express their views, but we regret that they did so by disrupting the train service. We ask them not to obstruct train services and affect other passengers using the MTR.""
Referring to the possibility of MTR Corp staff downing tools, Cheng said there were so far no cases of train drivers going on strike.
""Only one or two drivers called in sick,"" he said.
At Tiu Keng Leng station, a 30-year-old clerk, surnamed Chan, said he had been on the platform since 8.15am and was supposed to be at work by 9am.
""I support the objectives of protesters, but it's not good that they are using this method to voice their demands as it inconveniences everyone,"" he said.
""I really hope this will blow over soon.""
As more passengers remained stuck on platforms at Tiu Keng Leng, the situation became more tense. Arguments and scuffles broke out, with both sides yelling expletives at each other.
A similar campaign took place last Wednesday in Admiralty during the morning rush hour. A Chai Wan-bound train left Admiralty station 18 minutes late.
Hong Kong has been rattled by protests and several other non-cooperative movements since early June. They were sparked by the now-shelved extradition bill, which would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions with which the city does not have such an agreement, including the mainland.
Protesters have demanded that the Hong Kong government completely withdraw the bill and release those arrested in clashes.
Transport minister Frank Chan Fan yesterday urged protesters not to disrupt railway operations, noting the MTR served more than 5 million people a day.
He said protesters' actions had created chaos and could cause safety concerns.
""I urge friends who want to ­express their opinions to do it through other ways and handle it in a peaceful and rational ­manner,"" Chan said.
Police would be restrained in handling the matter as long as opinions were expressed peacefully, he added.
Chan said the government had listened carefully to residents and Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor had clearly responded to the protesters' major demands."
South China Morning Post,2019-07-13,"The call of Kowloon It is the site of flashy neon lights and old shophouses, giving Hong Kong much o",1061 ,"
""This is a time for Kowloon people to be proud!"" Vivian Chiu Ma-yan, 34, a Facebook user, said on her page. ""Finally, this time we don't need to hop across the harbour to join a protest!""
She was referring to last Sunday's mass rally against the now-suspended extradition bill- the first one on the Kowloon side of ­Victoria Harbour.
While Hong Kong Island holds the administrative centre where government buildings and the chief executive's official residence are located, Kowloon contains much of the character of Hong Kong, with its old shophouses, arts and entertainment zones, as well as flashing neon signs in a stark contrast to the cold gleam of steel and glass across the water.
On Sunday, an estimated 230,000 ­marchers showed up against the bill, while police said the rally peaked at 56,000. Whatever the figure, it was still many times more than the initial 2,000 ­expected.
The march began at the popular Tsim Sha Tsui commercial district and ended at the West Kowloon terminus of the high-speed rail link to Guangzhou. Along the way, thousands spilled into streets leading off Nathan Road. At the end of the rally, many protesters stayed on, marching to Mong Kok, one of the city's busiest and most densely populated areas, sparking stand-offs with police that were at times reminiscent of scenes from the 2014 ­Occupy movement.
Many have described the mass ­protest in Kowloon that day as rare and a reflection of a city gripped by a political crisis.
Critics want the bill completely ­withdrawn, among other demands.
The controversial legislation would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions with which Hong Kong has no extradition deal, including the mainland.
How is a Kowloon protest different? Hong Kong as a special administrative region comprises three main areas: Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories. Traditionally, Hong Kong Island first colonised by the British was ­developed earlier, and considered to be more prestigious than Kowloon.
It therefore became the city's business, financial and political heart, especially after the Tamar complex was built in 2003 in Admiralty to house the legislature and ­government headquarters. To the east are ­cultural and convention facilities where major political events are usually held.
As a result of this status, regular protests usually take place on Hong Kong Island, with the most preferred marching route being from Victoria Park in Causeway Bay to Tamar Park in­ ­Admiralty.
This was also a reason why many observers were surprised at the turnout for the protest on Sunday. Two marches held on Hong Kong Island last month attracted millions, according to organisers, drawing worldwide media attention.
Owing to the lack of official buildings in Kowloon, there was little reason for demonstrators to remain late into the night, unlike on July 1 in Admiralty when the Hong Kong ­government headquarters was stormed and vandalised by radical activists.
""Unlike protesting on Hong Kong Island where we directed our effort towards Legco or the government headquarters, this one [in Kowloon] left us a bit at a loss,"" a user on the popular Linden forum says. ""Once protesters were scattered, they did not have a place to regroup again. It seems no different to target this street or another in Mong Kok.""
Another user echoes the view, saying ­protesters had no intention to stay behind or occupy Mong Kok after the latest rally anyway since crowds were not prepared and there was no target of officialdom.
In a quote coined by martial arts screen legend Bruce Lee, they dissolved ""like water"", quicker and earlier than expected on Sunday.
Street food, a distraction?Veteran protesters such as Vivian Chiu also note that the allure of street food in ­Kowloon could be a distraction for marchers. Instead of meandering through high-rises on Hong Kong Island, those who turned up on Sunday had to navigate narrower streets and the aroma of cheap snacks such as those wafting from fishball stalls.
""This is especially so when you reach the part near Mong Kok!"" Chiu says.
Owing to the higher-than-expected numbers, the snaking procession ground to a halt at certain points, with marchers ­streaming into side streets where they faced unfamiliar obstacles.
In Mong Kok, for instance, these consisted of a mishmash of street markets, boutiques and small arcades.
This also meant that journalists covering the protest had to do so from different angles than those on Hong Kong Island.
On the island side, photographers had plenty of vantage points, from high-rises to bridges peppering Causeway Bay, Wan Chai and Admiralty.
In Kowloon, however, some were seen climbing up large overhead road signs in ­order to get wider shots of the crowds.
Then why protest in Kowloon?
The lack of proximity to the city centre and political landmarks meant protesters had a different agenda - targeting mainland ­shoppers.
On Sunday, many demonstrators wielded placards in simplified Chinese, a script used on the mainland, while giving speeches through loudspeakers in Mandarin instead of Cantonese.
The aim was to get their message across to those beyond the border, who live under tight media censorship enforced by the central government.
As a famed shopping hub, Mong Kok has seen its fair share of action. The area was one of the focus points of the 79-day ­Occupy movement for greater democracy in 2014, as protesters brought traffic to a ­standstill on ­Nathan Road, with the ­thoroughfare ­becoming a stretch of tents and rally zones for protesters.
As recently as 2016, violence erupted in Mong Kok after authorities cracked down on unlicensed street vendors on the eve of Lunar New Year.
The clashes escalated into a riot, spurred by radicals who found an opportunity to vent their frustrations, resulting in injuries to 44 police officers and 24 arrests.
On social media, the bloody ­confrontation, which lasted more than 10 hours, was dubbed the ""Fishball Revolution"".
It is the home of flashy neon signs and old shophouses, which give Hong Kong much of its character and history. And, last Sunday, tens of thousands took to its famous Nathan Road and less grand thoroughfares to protest against the now-suspended extradition bill.

South China Morning Post,2019-08-09,Protesters reject top Beijing Official's offer of inquiry Anti-government demonstrators say authorit,615 ,"
Anti-government protesters have vowed ""no negotiation and no compromise"" a day after Beijing's top official overseeing Hong Kong affairs said one of their demands - an inquiry into the recent political saga - could happen only when the chaos had ended.
Beijing's call for unity also prompted a league of major property developers to jointly condemn the increasingly violent protests against the now-shelved extradition bill.
On Wednesday, Zhang ­Xiaoming, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, denounced the Hong Kong protests as bearing the ""obvious characteristics of a colour revolution"" and urged some 500 political and business leaders who met him in Shenzhen to fearlessly safeguard the city's rule of law.
Zhang left open the possibility of the government setting up a commission to investigate the ­recent unrest, something widely called for, but only when the ­protests had ended.
However, a group of activists who have taken part in the spate of protests made clear they would not halt the protests before their demands were met.
""The government should first respond to our five demands instead of asking us to stop protesting,"" David Chan told a press conference organised by protesters online. ""We won't accept any negotiation or compromise ­because we have no trust in the government.""
The five demands included the inquiry, the bill's complete withdrawal, the exoneration of ­arrested protesters, an end to calling the protests ""riots"", and ­universal suffrage.
Meanwhile, 16 major developers, all members of the Hong Kong Real Estate Developers Association, released a statement strongly condemning the escalating protests. They included the biggest players, such as Sun Hung Kai Properties, CK Asset Holdings, Henderson Land Development, New World Development, Sino Land and Swire Properties.
Notably absent from the list was Chinese Estate, which is controlled by fugitive tycoon Joseph Lau Luen-hung, who earlier sought a legal challenge against the bill, but eventually dropped it.
Tam Yiu-chung, the city's sole delegate to the nation's top legislative body, said Zhang left open the possibility of a commission of inquiry (COI), but also told all at the Shenzhen meeting to have faith in the ""widely representative"" Independent Police Complaints Council.
""Zhang said the crisis has been escalating and flooded with diverse opinions, so the conditions for conducting the investigation are not available,"" Tam said. ""[He said] the issue of accountability could only be looked into after the saga is over.""
Tam added that Zhang said those calling for a COI wanted to weaken the police. ""I believe we could look into the possibilities after the saga is over,"" Tam said.
Democratic Party chairman Wu Chi-wai viewed Zhang's idea of an ""open door"" as a delaying tactic. ""If the government fails to set up a COI now, it will have no motivation to do so after the protests are over,"" Wu said.
Citing a survey by veteran pollster Robert Chung Ting-yiu, which found that about 80 per cent of respondents said a COI should be established, Wu said it was the only way for Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to regain authority and continue to govern.
However, executive councillors Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee and Ip Kwok-him voiced reservations about a COI. ""I don't think anyone would close the door when turmoil comes to a close,"" Regina Ip said. ""But a judge-led COI may not be the best way forward as a judge can't collect much evidence and it would be difficult to summon protesters.""
Ip Kwok-him said any review should focus on solving the city's deep-rooted conflicts, rather than just looking at police conduct.

South China Morning Post,2019-11-02,The harder blows of the summer of discontent Economic damage from this year's street violence is muc,1406 ,"
Today marks 125 days since ­protesters stormed Hong Kong's legislature on July 1, a public ­holiday to mark the return of the city's sovereignty to China. They laid waste to the Legislative Council's chambers, spray-painting slogans and destroying property.
What had begun on June 9 as an uneventful march by an estimated 1 million people opposing a controversial extradition bill had descended into mayhem involving frequent clashes between ­police and protesters.
Now, as the unrest enters its fifth month, Hong Kong's economy has suffered its worst ­quarterly contraction in a decade, slumping by 3.2 per cent in the three months to September and putting the city into its first ­recession since 2008.
The toll on the economy has surpassed other crises and natural disasters in recent memory, ­including the 2003 outbreak of ­severe acute respiratory ­syndrome (Sars), based on a ­comparison of key economic measures.
The protests have piled onto the economic woes of a city that is already suffering from the year-long US-China trade war.
The effects have been more pronounced on the benchmark Hang Seng Index, the stock ­market's turnover, retail sales, tourist arrivals, economic activity, the number of initial public offerings and the number of bankruptcies. Sars was rougher on three measures: property prices, real ­estate transactions and employment, according to the data.
For the catering and retail trades, it was almost a case of deja vu, as the street violence and the fall in tourist arrivals kept customers at home, but even more so than Sars had done in 2003.
""The current protests are much worse than Sars,"" said Tommy Cheung Yu-yan, a city legislator representing the catering industry. ""Already, 200 ­restaurants and shops have closed, and the ­closures may ­exceed 1,000 next year.""
The protests this year have happened during the summer months and the ""golden week"" National Day holiday period, when restaurants are usually packed during weekends and at nights.
""Now people avoid gathering during weekends or night times because they worry about the ­protests or the MTR may close early. Our shops have become busier during weekdays or lunches over the past few months,"" said a Japanese restaurant manager who wanted to only be identified by her surname Chu.
""People now will first check online on when and where the protests will be held before they book a table. If the protests were held on the Kowloon side, we had a full house as our shop is located in Causeway Bay. If they were held in Causeway Bay or nearby, there were no bookings and we only had one or two tables during the protests. It was close to an empty house and our boss closed the shop early,"" Chu said.
Property developer and local businessman Allan Zeman, dubbed the ""Father of Lan Kwai Fong"" for his role in turning the area into Hong Kong's main entertainment hotspot of 300 bars and restaurants, remembered not sleeping much as Sars kept people away from the nightlife.
But he said this year's Halloween was the worst on record in the 33-year history of the celebration due to a protest march from Causeway Bay to Lan Kwai Fong on Thursday night.
The protests have also reached into more intimate areas, even ­affecting wedding plans.
Sars only lasted for a few months, so wedding plans were not seriously affected. The protests, however, have led to about 12 per cent of 729 couples who had intended to get married by 2021 delaying their plans, while 1 per cent have cancelled their ­weddings altogether, according to a survey conducted by online platform ESDlife this month.
""There are many requests to change wedding banquets from dinners to lunches, while some are moving the dates from weekends to weekdays to avoid the protests. There have also been a few cases where they have ­cancelled bookings,"" said a ­manager of Chariot Club, a ­private eating and entertainment venue in Central.
Cheung, the lawmaker, said: ""If the protests continue until Christmas and the Lunar New Year, it is going to lead to more cancellations of bookings of ­banquet orders, and hence the closures of more restaurants.
""It should be noted that many restaurants rely on earnings ­during the peak season's festival times to survive the low season after the Lunar New Year. If the peak ­season has little business, a lot of restaurants may not ­survive next year.""
Some staff felt the impact of the protests more keenly than that of Sars.
""During both Sars and the ­current protests, we were asked to take annual leave or sometimes no-pay leave. Sometimes there were more waiters than ­customers, so we did not need that many people to work,"" said Yeung Kong-ying, a waiter at the Old Shanghai restaurant in Wan Chai.
""But Sars lasted for only three months, while the current ­protests have lasted for five months already.""
However, he also found that customers were adapting.
""Our restaurant is in Wan Chai where there have been many ­protests during weekends. But we found that customers had got used to the pattern and come more often during weekdays and avoid weekends,"" he said.
In a number of other measures, too, the 2019 summer of discontent has had a much larger economic impact than Sars.
Tourist arrivals fell 17.5 per cent during the March-May ­period of 2003, the peak of the ­epidemic, but when the protests were at their height in August to October this year, arrivals slumped 43 per cent.
Average stock market turnover dropped 2.4 per cent in the Sars period but 18 per cent during the protest months, while the Hang Seng ­Index gained 5.2 per cent during Sars but lost 6.6 per cent during the protests.
The city's all-important ­property market, on the other hand, has fared better recently than in 2003.
During Sars, property prices declined 9 per cent, according to the Centa-City Leading Index, while transactions in the secondary market plunged a whopping 67 per cent.
In contrast, prices of used homes fell 5.5 per cent between July and October this year, the peak protest months, while the number of transactions in the ­secondary market ­declined 18 per cent.
""Sars saw a bigger drop in property prices and transaction volumes as the economy had been weak since the 1998 Asian financial crisis and the unemployment rate was high at the time,"" said Sammy Po Siu-ming, chief executive of Midland Realty's ­residential division.
He recalled that the illness had an impact on more than just ­prices in the market.
""Back in 2003, everybody had to wear masks in the office or on the street,"" Po said. ""Many people were reluctant to go out, while property owners were also not willing to let potential buyers enter their homes for fear of potential infection.""
During Sars, the property ­market was also faced with an oversupply after the government set an aggressive target to add 85,000 new houses every year.
By 2019, housing supply had turned from a glut into a shortage, with 47,779 new houses being planned a year earlier, driving prices to record levels and making Hong Kong the world's most ­unaffordable major city to live in.
When it came to getting the city back on its feet after Sars, the government launched a series of measures, including allowing in more mainland tourists and making it easier for Hong Kong and mainland firms to work together.
Spending in Hong Kong by mainland businesses was a major lifeline that helped the city dig itself out of its post-Sars slump, as they snapped up offices and prime addresses.
Mainland tourists, meanwhile, poured into the city to shop for everything from luxury goods to wealth management products and insurance coverage.
Ironically, in its efforts to help, the government may have in­advertently sown the seeds of this year's discontent.
""Sadly, these measures ­created resentment among Hongkongers and stoked the rage behind the hard-core protesters. It will be more difficult to reboot the economy this time than after Sars as it is not just about a disease, but about a split in society, where some people are very against mainland tourists and businesses,"" said Jojo Choy Sze-chung, vice-chairman of the Institute of Securities Dealers.
""Many of the current protests have targeted mainland-related banks and shops. It will be hard to encourage more mainland ­tourists to come and to develop more cross-border business cooperation.""
But he said Hong Kong did not have a choice if it wanted to bounce back again.
""Without mainland com­panies or mainland tourists, Hong Kong's economy would never be the same,"" Choy said."
South China Morning Post,2019-07-26,"CCTV news reports pan protesters, blame 'external forces' But analysts say Beijing still showing res",847 ,"
China's most watched daily ­television news programme has aired a series of damning reports about the anti-government protesters in Hong Kong and blamed ""external forces"" for helping to disrupt ­order in the city.
State broadcaster CCTV's prime-time evening news ­programme Xinwen Lianbo ­began the run on Saturday with a report promoting the ""Protect Hong Kong"" rally organised by Beijing supporters at Tamar Park in Admiralty.
Subsequent reports covered the violent protests outside ­Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong on Sunday night, when ­protesters sprayed anti-China ­slogans on the wall of the building and splashed black paint on the national emblem.
Yesterday the programme interviewed businesspeople and Hong Kong citizens who said the city's economy would suffer if the protests continued.
Johnny Wei, 45, a businessman who lives in Zhaoqing, Guangdong, said he was in tears when he watched the reports.
""I knew about the protests in Hong Kong, but I was still shocked when I saw the national emblem covered in black paint,"" he said.
""I had tears in my eyes. This was too much. I respect their right to protest but they should not ­insult our country.""
On CCTV's official Weibo ­account, most of the 3,000 comments that accompanied the ­video clips of the protests at the liaison office were critical of the protesters.
Other state media, including People's Dailyand Xinhua, carried strongly worded commentaries on the protests.
Xiake Dao, a social media ­account affiliated with the overseas edition of People's Daily, published a commentary accusing Hong Kong and Western media of ""playing a disgraceful role"" in fanning the flames of the month-long unrest in the city.
A Communist Party official, who works at the liaison office and was on duty on Sunday night, said he was shocked by the violence and rage shown by the protesters.
""Things are very different this time [compared with previous protests],"" he said. ""This is the first time since the 1997 handover that the national emblem has been vandalised and I heard [the protesters chanting] slogans like, 'It's time for revolution' and 'recover Hong Kong'.
""I see this as a watershed event and I am not the only one here who feels that way,"" the official said on condition of anonymity.
Xinwen Lianbo did not interview any Hong Kong government officials or police about the ­protests.
On Tuesday, the programme's reports included criticism by ­foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, who claimed Washington had ­instigated the protests in Hong Kong, but did not elaborate.
A journalist who works for the Guangzhou Daily group, but asked not to be identified, said newspaper editors on the mainland had been told they must toe the official line when reporting events in Hong Kong.
""On reports about Hong Kong, we are under strict orders to use copy provided by state media like Xinhua or CCTV, and we can only carry official statements released by official departments,"" the journalist said.
Wu Junfei, deputy director of the Tianda Institute, a think tank in Hong Kong, said: ""Xinwen ­Lianbo is the most important channel for Chinese leaders to communicate their agenda to the public.
""The lengthy reports and ­commentaries about Hong Kong show that the leadership in ­Beijing is taking the situation very seriously and wants to communicate a clear position to the mainland and the rest of the world.""
Despite the criticism, Beijing had shown some restraint, he said.
""We can see that the central government has been cautious on Hong Kong, and has only called the protests 'violent incidents' and not 'riots' in the hope that ­order can be restored in the city soon.""
But Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, said he believed the storming of the Legislative Council on July 1 and the protest at the liaison office had pushed Beijing's leaders to take a tougher stance and send a strong message on the ­importance of stability.
""The storming of the Legco building and vandalising of the liaison office have given Beijing the justification to attack the anti-government protesters, who are now being described as violent people who destroy public property, attack the police and cause great losses for the Hong Kong public,"" he said.
""But the reports have not ­provided a proper explanation [of what caused the protests].
""So mainlanders who watched the programmes will get the ­impression that the protesters who opposed the extradition bill are troublemakers who want Hong Kong to break away from China, and that is obviously against the will of almost all mainland Chinese.""
Wu said that as Beijing blocked access to many foreign news sites and other sources of information, most mainlanders did not have access to unbiased information and tended to believe Beijing's propaganda.
Referring to the gang of thugs who randomly attacked people at Yuen Long MTR station on Sunday night after the protest, he said: ""Even in the case of the mob attacks, most mainlanders believe that the 'unpatriotic' protesters deserved to be beaten as they only have access to one side of the story."""
South China Morning Post,2019-09-09,"mtr faces biggest challenge in 40 years, railway chiefs say Top bosses plead with protesters to 'tre",540 ,"
The MTR's top bosses said the firm is ""experiencing the most ­tremendous challenges"" in its 40 year history.
The civil unrest sweeping the city has turned MTR stations into flashpoints for clashes between police and protesters in recent weeks.
In an open letter to passengers yesterday, the MTR Corporation's chairman, Rex Auyeung Pak-kuen, and CEO Jacob Kam Chak-pui, condemned ""all violence"" and said they ""deeply regret"" the vandalism at stations. Their letter also praised the company's staff.
""Facing this challenging ­situation, MTR colleagues have been making their best endeavour to recover and repair facilities in a timely manner to minimise the impacts on passengers,"" the letter read. ""We express our ­deepest gratitude to all colleagues who have spared no effort in their work and provided a safe railway service impartially.""
They stressed the corporation was a ""home grown Hong Kong public transport operator"" and urged ""all sectors of the community [to] treasure and safeguard this railway network, which has been carrying our collective memories over the past few ­decades"".
In an apparent appeal to the protesters, the letter read: ""Please allow us to honour our commitment and continue to provide our fellow citizens with safe and ­reliable railway service.""
But, the appeal appeared to have fallen on deaf ears as more chaos descended on stations ­yesterday, as protesters again vandalised stations after what had been largely a peaceful march in ­Central.
A group barricaded and set fires outside several entrances of Central station, while some also smashed glass partitions, ­turnstiles, and television screens at Wan Chai station as they marched towards Causeway Bay, in what appeared to be a spontaneous protest.
MTR Corp has become a target of attacks by anti-government protesters in recent months. At first, they vandalised the station facilities and removed equipment to block police from chasing them into the station.
Crowds also besieged stations and harassed staff, blaming them for allowing police to get into the stations to catch protesters.
The rail operator was granted a court injunction on August 23, ­restraining anyone from unlawfully and wilfully ­obstructing or interfering with the proper use and operation of the railway. It also bans any action damaging any station property, or behaving in a riotous or disorderly manner.
Any person who neglects to obey or comply with the injunction order may be held in contempt of court and jailed or fined. But vandalism has not stopped.
On August 31, five of the rail lines were forced to suspend ­services as multiple MTR stations along the Island, Tsuen Wan, and Kwun Tong lines were attacked.
On August 31, police stormed the platform of Prince Edward ­station and used pepper spray, made multiple arrests, and hit several people with batons. ­Protesters are seeking the release of surveillance camera tapes at the station to ""disclose the truth"".
""The MTR management has been too weak in dealing with protesters,"" said Luk Chung-hung, the deputy chairman of the Legislative Council subcommittee on railways. ""It has been granted an injunction, it should ask bailiffs to be sent to help stop protesters. Just issuing a letter condemning violence is far from enough."""
South China Morning Post,2019-09-02,Undercover officers fire shots after being attacked,485 ,"
More details emerged yesterday about the firing of two warning shots into the air by undercover police ­officers at Victoria Park on ­Saturday night, when they were ­attacked by protesters after their cover was blown.
There were no reports of injuries after the live rounds were discharged, according to a police spokeswoman, who stressed the officers had clearly indicated they were police and gave warnings after being ­attacked by a crowd.
But critics accused the officers of disguising themselves as protesters, who usually wear black clothes with helmets and face masks, and said they had used ­excessive force in firing their weapons.
The incident marked the ­second time live rounds had been fired during 13 weeks of anti-government protests.
But it was the first time a firearm had been used by police operating under cover as protesters, the spokeswoman confirmed at a press conference yesterday.
The rounds were fired at 9.05pm and 9.10pm at Victoria Park in Causeway Bay during a night of chaos and violence when protesters clashed with police in several neighbourhoods after a rally was banned on Hong Kong Island.
Earlier on Saturday, police had fired blue dye from water cannons, multiple rounds of tear gas and used pepper spray on protesters, who had lit fires and hurled petrol bombs at them.
Amid the chaos, one protester had alerted others on Great George Street that there were undercover police in nearby ­Victoria Park, identifiable by flashing LED lights on their backpacks, according to a witness later interviewed by local ­media.
A group of protesters surrounded another group of men dressed in black, one of whom broke free and ran towards the harbourfront, according to a ­witness.
Other protesters gave chase and managed to catch him and pin him to the ground, remove his mask and take his mobile phone, the witness said.
According to the police spokeswoman, the undercover officers were surrounded, taunted and attacked by protesters, who tried to snatch their mobile phones and the firearm of one of the policemen.
One live round was fired at 9.05pm, she said.
The officers then retreated further into Victoria Park because they came under attack by at least 10 protesters, who had metal poles, bamboo sticks, bricks and petrol bombs.
A second warning shot was fired at 9.10pm near a fountain in Victoria Park. Video from several local media outlets showed a man dressed as a protester pointing a pistol at another black-clad man, and then arresting him.
Several other protesters were also seen being handcuffed by undercover officers in a separate video filmed by local media.
The police have yet to confirm if anyone had been arrested in Victoria Park following the ­incident.
Undercover officers were first spotted on August 11, also in Causeway Bay, when police dressed in black arrested ­protesters on the street, a move demonstrators later said had caused them to lose trust in their peers."
South China Morning Post,2019-09-08,"No Tear gas, no petrol bombs but tension stays Bid to disrupt airport thwarted by pre-emptive police",663 ,"
Fewer protesters turned out on the streets yesterday, days after Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor announced the formal withdrawal of the extradition bill that sparked the worst ­unrest in the city in decades.
No tear gas was used nor petrol bombs thrown at the start of the 14th weekend of anti-government protests, and the level of violence seen in previous weekends was avoided, but a handful of demonstrators were arrested.
Strong pre-emptive police and government action snuffed out the protesters' attempt to again besiege the Hong Kong International Airport. The MTR Corporation, the city's main railway operator, closed the Kowloon. Tsing Yi and AsiaWorld-Expo stations on the Airport Express line, leaving only the Hong Kong station and airport station open, with a heavy police presence at both.
Police also set up checkpoints on approach roads to the airport, even taking the unprecedented step of searching passengers' bags on buses and trains.
The increased security prevented the chaos seen last weekend, when protesters paralysed airport traffic and left hundreds of travellers stranded. That followed a separate demonstration last month when protesters occupied the arrivals hall, causing the cancellation of more than 900 flights.
Yesterday, with their bid to disrupt the airport foiled, protesters shifted their focus to MTR stations and shopping centres owned by the railway operator. Dozens of protesters staged peaceful sit-ins at several shopping centres including Sha Tin's Citylink and Kowloon Bay's Telford Plaza.
There were some scuffles at Tung Chung station. But with riot police outnumbering protesters, the crowd was soon dispersed. At least four people were taken away by officers.
Prince Edward MTR station emerged as the focal point of the protests. It was closed in the afternoon when demonstrators started to gather. At least 200 people surrounded the station demanding the ""truth"" after rumours circulated that three protesters - some say six - had been ""executed"" there by police on August 31 and their bodies ""whisked away"". The government issued a strong denial, describing the rumours as ""malicious"".
""It is deeply regrettable that such irresponsible rumours keep spreading with the ill intent to mislead the public, and to sow ­division and discontent in society at a time when the government is sincerely trying to establish a dialogue platform,"" a government statement said.
A police source said the chief executive was very concerned about the rumour and demanded that an inter-department press conference - involving police, Hospital Authority, Fire Services Department and MTR - be held, possibly tomorrow.
Protesters were not convinced by the government denial, with people placing candles, flowers and joss paper for the ""victims"" - although no one knew who they were. Kelly Kan, 26, knelt in front of wreaths at the station for two hours. ""The number of people being sent to hospital just doesn't add up,"" Kan said.
Ten protesters were said to be injured during a station clash, but only seven were confirmed to have been sent to hospital. The ambulance service later clarified this was a counting error.
Protesters also gathered outside Mong Kok Police Station at nightfall yesterday.
The worst violence happened late in the evening inside Sha Tin MTR station, where a dozen protesters cornered some police and attacked them with umbrellas and metal objects. Officers retreated into the control room and locked themselves in as violent protesters tried to kick down the door. Riot police eventually arrived to relieve their colleagues.
Yesterday's protests followed Lam's announcement on Wednesday that she would formally withdraw the bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to the mainland for trial.
Many protesters vowed to fight on until all five of their demands - which include an independent inquiry into police handling of the unrest - were met.

South China Morning Post,2019-09-23,Riot police rescue minister trapped by protesters,384 ,"
Anti-government protesters gave Hong Kong's minister in charge of constitutional and mainland ­affairs a taste of belligerence and defiance yesterday, harassing him at a public event and trapping him in his car for almost 20 minutes before riot police rescued him.
The episode happened just four days before the first Community Dialogue session by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng ­Yuet-ngor in Wan Chai where she will meet 150 residents in her latest effort to alleviate the months of social unrest triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill.
More than 100 protesters had gone to the Tsing Yi promenade yesterday afternoon as Patrick Nip Tak-kuen attended an event celebrating National Day.
During his speech - in which he called on Hongkongers to seize the opportunities in the Greater Bay Area development plan - ­protesters chanted slogans, sang the protest anthem Glory to Hong Kong, and pointed laser pens.
""Five demands, not one less!"" the crowd continued to chant when a group of children took the stage for a dance performance.
Lam announced the bill's withdrawal on September 4, fulfilling one of the protesters' five demands, but demonstrators want an inquiry into police handling of the unrest, and universal suffrage, among other demands.
Speaking briefly to reporters after the event, Nip said the government was willing to talk to ­citizens, but was called a ""hypocrite"" by some protesters.
Nip said: ""Actually we are very willing to listen to voices and opinions from all sides, so our upcoming dialogue will have many different methods.""
Nip managed to get into his car, but was eventually trapped when protesters - mostly young and masked - blocked it from leaving by sitting down then using rubbish bins and sandbags.
Only a dozen officers of the Civil Aid Service were present to protect Nip when several protesters hurled drink bottles, sandbags and two metal poles at the official's car, cracking the front windscreen. The riot police arrived after about 20 minutes.
Later, recounting the incident on Facebook, Nip said he thought about getting out of his car to talk to protesters but decided not to do so due to security concerns.
""Some protesters were getting more emotional,"" he wrote. ""I was worried about the safety of ­citizens, children and staff at the carnival if I got out rashly."""
South China Morning Post,2019-11-09,foreigners join protesters to show solidarity Those who fly in say they are moved to help out on the,1325 ,"
Ben Song was among thousands of people standing shoulder to shoulder at a recent Friday night rally in the city's Edinburgh Place.
As the protesters waved their lit mobile phones and shouted Cantonese slogans, Song stayed silent.
But as soon as the chants switched to English, his voice rang out loud with theirs: ""Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong!""
The 26-year-old Uber driver from Arlington, Texas, was new to it all. This was his second night in Hong Kong, and his first protest. Just three days earlier, he was still at home in the United States.
""I'd been watching theprotests for months,"" Song says.
""I thought to myself all that time: 'I wish I was over there, I wish I could support them'.""
Half Korean and half Japanese, Song speaks no Cantonese and has no family connection in Hong Kong. He is among a number of foreigners and former Hong Kong residents who have been moved by five months of anti-government protests to visit the city and join the demonstrations too.
Beijing has accused countries like the US of supporting the protest movement and meddling in Hong Kong's internal affairs.
The protesters and pro-­democracy activists, meanwhile, have actively courted global attention, seeking support from the US Congress and other Western governments, and waving American, British, and other foreign flags at rallies and marches.
Sociology professor Hung ­Ho-fung of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, says it would not be surprising if Beijing views the presence of those from overseas as evidence of foreign interference.
But the author of Protest with Chinese Characteristics, a study of the history of protests in imperial China, suggests that the Hong Kong movement has drawn outsiders because of the worldwide attention it has received.
""Foreign individuals are welcomed [by protesters], like US senators who visit,"" he says.
""Many people increasingly see that it's part of the global con-frontation against China's ­expansion.""
Still, he notes the number of foreigners at the protests appears low, and Hongkongers make up the core of the movement. 
Pro-establishment lawmaker Yiu Si-wing says while there may be nothing wrong with foreigners participating in lawful assemblies, they risk running foul of laws such as the Public Order ­Ordinance, if the rallies are ­unauthorised, or the Prohibition of Face Covering Regulation, if they wear masks.
He says he worries about the personal safety and legal risks for foreigners who take part in Hong Kong protests, as they may not understand local laws or be aware of how violent the clashes are.
Despite travel advisories issued from as early as July by ­several countries, visitors like Song have visited Hong Kong to be part of the protests.
He says coming to Hong Kong for the first time for this purpose made him nervous, scared, but very excited. For two weeks in September and October, he attended peaceful rallies.
""I've always thought of myself as a person who puts his money where his mouth is,"" he adds.
In his tiny hotel room in Tsim Sha Tsui the day before the October 1 rally, he had his protest gear laid out neatly on his bed: a yellow helmet, a gas mask, and a Kevlar vest left over from his time in the US Marine reserves.
He says he helped protesters build barricades on the streets, but insists he did not take part in violent acts such as throwing bricks or petrol bombs at police.
Song says he sees Hong Kong as part of a ""global struggle against totalitarianism"", but his Asian-American identity makes it easy for him to sympathise with the city's protesters.
""My friends who are Asian, we are all Asian together,"" he says. ""We all feel a shared experience.""
Another protester from the US feels a closer connection. Andy, 20, who asks to be identified by his first name only and prefers not to show his face when photographed, is the son of a Viet­namese mother and Hong­konger father, and was raised in ­California.
A third-year college student in California, he has taken a semester off to be in Hong Kong.
He says he grew up listening to the struggles of communist ­Vietnam, from which his mother escaped to the US. That has helped him understand Hongkongers' anxiety about growing mainland influence.
""Seeing it happen to Hong Kong, which is the other half of my identity, definitely resonated within me. I felt like I had to do something,"" he says, explaining his decision to join the protests.
He defends his participation as showing solidarity with ­Hongkongers, not ""foreign ­interference"".
Describing his involvement in the city's unrest, he says: ""I am American, but doing no organisation. The locals are the ones with the ideas, bravery and drive to push the movement forward.""
He helps at protests by ­handing out food vouchers and supplies, and has made a trip to Taiwan to buy gas masks that are becoming increasingly scarce. Andy says he is not one of the frontline radical protesters who have been trashing MTR stations and the premises of businesses perceived as pro-Beijing, or ­engaging in violent confrontations with police.
But he adds that he understands why the protests have turned violent. ""It's a natural response when the government has such deaf ears,"" he says. ­""Although I don't personally ­endorse the violence, I won't mentally distance myself from the movement because of it.""
For Mimi Lee, a Hongkonger who lives in Toronto, returning to join the protests was something she felt she needed to do, even if only for four days.
The financial adviser in her 40s had been following news of the protests, and helped organise ­rallies and events in Toronto to support protesters in Hong Kong, despite having left the city with her parents when she was 16.
Now a Canadian citizen, Lee says she was not so involved during the 2014 Occupy movement, when protesters shut down parts of Hong Kong for 79 days.
""I regretted at the time that I didn't come back,"" she admits.
On October 1, Lee waved a ­Canadian flag as she joined a peaceful march down Hennessy Road in Wan Chai, the only ­protest she attended before ­returning to Canada. ""As overseas Hongkongers, we are all having depression, seeing what's happening in Hong Kong,"" she says.
Associate professor Chan Yuk-wah of the department of Asian and international studies at the City University of Hong Kong, says civil movements like the protests can produce an ""activist identity"" that gains empathy across borders.
""The sight of young people speaking up and being determined always moves other people,"" adds Chan. ""This sentiment is a psychological connection.""
Pro-establishment lawmaker Yiu feels the government should do more overseas to present the full picture of what is going on, so that foreigners are aware before they travel to join the protests.
""It is hard to stop foreign people from taking part in protests, but I think the Hong Kong government should step up its overseas promotions, so that people know more about the violence involved,"" he says. ""I fear the foreigners might have only seen one side of the story ... and have the impression that Hong Kong has no democracy or freedom at all.""
Of the three foreign protesters the Post interviewed, only Andy is still in Hong Kong.
He is staying until December, but says it was not an easy decision and he wondered about putting his life on hold. ""But if it's something you stand behind, you should just go for it,"" he says.
Lee is back in Toronto, but is continuing her efforts. She recently led a group distributing thousands of T-shirts at the opening NBA basketball game in Toronto.
""We want people in Hong Kong to know: stay in there, hang on, ga yau,"" she says, using the Cantonese term for encouragement that translates to ""add oil"".
Song is home in Texas. He says his stay helped him realise the protests were a desperate struggle for many people, and he could not just return to the US and resume his normal life. He says: ""As soon as I got back, I was thinking, 'Okay, how do I go back again?'""

South China Morning Post,2019-11-25,Protesters take day off to cast their votes No sign of masked demonstrators on streets following wor,728 ,"
If there was no sign anywhere in Hong Kong yesterday of masked protesters in black T-shirts, it was because the word went out to all to set the day aside for voting in the district council elections.
Online platforms popular among protesters, including the Telegram messaging app and ­online forum LIHKG, shared ­messages telling everyone eligible to vote not to use their smartphones, dress in black or wear masks inside polling stations, to make sure their votes were valid.
Regular protester Kevin, 21, a student at the University of Hong Kong, cast his ballot and encouraged others to vote against pro-government candidates.
""The only winning result, for me, will be when the government responds to our five demands,"" he said, referring to protesters' calls for universal suffrage and an inquiry into alleged police brutality, among others.
""If we have more votes in the pro-democracy camp, we'll have more legitimacy to fight on,"" he said.
The past two weeks have seen clashes between police and students at Chinese University and Polytechnic ­University.
Most of about 1,000 masked radicals and their supporters who occupied PolyU and engaged in intense clashes with police a week ago are no longer on the campus, but a few are still holding out, with police waiting for them to emerge.
Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said last month that more than a third of those arrested at the time were under 18 years old, meaning they were not eligible to vote. As of last Monday, nearly 4,500 people had been arrested in connection with the unrest.
A 58-year-old retired logistics worker, identifying herself only as Chan, said she had been at nearly every weekend protest since June but yesterday was a volunteer for a pro-democracy candidate.
""The government has dismissed the legitimacy of protests, but if we are able to show them that we have legitimacy through votes, they cannot just ignore us,"" she said.
She was handing out leaflets for candidate Lucifer Siu Tak-Kin of Mong Kok North constituency, who is challenging incumbent Wong Shu-ming from the pro-establishment camp.
Daniel Leung, 29, who works in marketing and voted in Tuen Mun, did not think that everyone who supported the protests ought to vote for pan-democrat ­candidates. ""We have to respect those who are pro-protest but want to cast a blank vote because they are not happy with what the pan-democrats have been doing over recent years,"" he said. ­""Respecting one's individual choice is the essence of ­democracy.""
Online platforms where protesters have been discussing their action plans were largely silent on their next moves.
A freelance tour guide who only gave his surname, Chan, said he sensed exhaustion in the movement.
""No one knows what's next yet. Over the past few days, most protesters have been focusing on asking people to vote,"" he said.
Chan, who said he was a frequent protester and helped to gather donations and supplies for the movement, felt the recent ­major clashes at CUHK and PolyU had affected many of the frontline demonstrators.
""They are still digesting the intense happenings and need time to figure out their next step, as many are physically tired,"" he said.
But he was confident that the protests would not die down, even if it appeared that the activists had no concrete plans.
He said: ""The collection of donations and materials has not stopped, the propaganda design teams have also been actively brainstorming. I believe things will be clearer after we know the election results.""
For some pro-government voters living in areas where there have been regular protests, all they want is for the disruption to end.
Law, 75, who lives along ­Nathan Road in Tsim Sha Tsui, declined to name his choice but said he was voting for a candidate who was not pro-protest.
""I am very scared of these young people who are creating trouble every day right below my home,"" he said. ""It has become really noisy and makes me feel it is unsafe to go out.
""They have not experienced poverty and a troubled society, so they do not understand how ­important it is for Hong Kong to continue to prosper.""
At a polling station in Yau Ma Tei, accountant Ho, 40, said she wanted life to return to normal.
""The MTR is still closing early, and my family has been staying at home a lot more on weekends,"" she said.
""I hope the protests die down soon and Hong Kong's image can be saved internationally."""
South China Morning Post,2019-08-13,Stranded travellers left to fend for themselves at airport,493 ,"
Hundreds of passengers were left stranded at the airport yesterday as thousands of protesters brought the transport hub to a grinding halt, and airline staff quit their posts.
With no employees in sight, passengers replaced staff at check-in desks, sitting in their seats and waiting to find out when, or even if, their flights would depart.
Some 180 flights to all parts of the globe were cancelled as anti-government protesters flooded the arrival and departure areas at one of the world's busiest airports. Another 45 flights that were ­expected to arrive were also ­cancelled.
A lack of information from ­airlines meant passengers kept ­arriving, not knowing flights had been ­cancelled for the day. They kept coming to the check-in counters to ask other travellers and reporters about flight information with staff nowhere to be seen.
Mickey Lai and her two young children arrived at 9pm ready to fly back to New York having ­received a text at 8.07pm telling them their flight would take-off at 11pm. But the­ information was incorrect.
""It was a fake message,"" the 46-year-old said.
Thanesha Rajoo had been hoping to fly back to Johannesburg from a first trip to Hong Kong where she was also greeted by protesters on her arrival. ""We got an email from Cathay Pacific that our flight was going to go ahead, but it didn't,"" said the 50-year-old.
Similar stories of passengers not being told their flights had been cancelled emerged throughout last night.
Normally, around 100,000 people would seamlessly pass through the airport but thousands of protesters wrecked their travel plans, and by yesterday evening the airport was unusually quiet.
And while the protesters had slipped away, disgruntled passengers with luggage in tow ­remained. ""I don't know when they're going to start [flights] again, or why they've been ­cancelled,"" said one passenger from Australia, who declined to give her name.
""I know some people have told us it's not safe, get out [of Hong Kong]. But where do we go? I don't know when we're going to be ­rescheduled.""
Earlier in the day, travellers ­arrived at the airport unaware of the chaos they were about to ­encounter: angry protesters ­determined to gridlock the airport to make their point heard.
Stepping off the Airport Express and into the airport's main terminal, travellers were met by a sea of angry black-shirted protesters, determined to make themselves heard to a global audience.
Inside the terminal, almost every inch of floor space in the ­departure and arrival halls was overrun, with protesters chanting ""shame on rogue cops!"" and ""stand with Hong Kong, fight for freedom"".
People had been gathering at the airport since midday, for a fourth straight day of protests, in what was a reaction to the actions of police on Sunday night.
Over the weekend, thousands of protesters at the airport had mostly been peaceful and handed out booklets, cards and stickers to tourists in a bid to win international support for their cause."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-18,Travellers unfazed by queues and tight security at airport High water barriers block street-level en,482 ,"
Travellers were calm yesterday as tight security kicked in at Hong Kong International Airport in the wake of anti-government protests that caused havoc for two days earlier in the week.
Two-metre-tall water barriers blocked the airport's street-level entrances, and people going through the two remaining entrances had to show a valid ticket or boarding pass to be allowed into the departure hall.
Yesterday morning, long lines formed at the two entrances as passengers waited to clear the ­security check at the doors.
By evening, however, the lines had cleared and passengers said they did not have any trouble entering the departure hall.
Niek Heemskerk, a business traveller from the Netherlands, was pleased with the security measures. ""I'm happy that it's not too overcrowded, so I can sit and read my book,"" he said.
The added security measures were put in place after the Airport Authority was granted a temporary injunction to keep protests within a designated area.
No protesters were seen yesterday, and the airport operated normally.
Police were seen stationed at airport entrances and men in plain clothes wearing ""security"" tags were also present.
An Australian visitor, who declined to be named, said: ""I feel the staff are being extra friendly to make up for the inconvenience.""
She said she was at the airport five hours early for her 10pm flight toSydney and did not think the extra security was an inconvenience. ""I feel more safe knowing people here are actually travelling,"" she said.
At the Airport Express platform at Hong Kong station, cordons were set up to direct passengers in one direction. The frequency of trains from Hong Kong was reduced to one every 20 minutes at the request of the government and Airport ­Authority.
Emmanuelle Goujet, from France, said she had arrived at the airport half an hour earlier than usual for a flight because she knew about the protests.
Goujet, who was travelling to Switzerland, said she had no trouble entering the airport.""They are just being cautious. If the security wasn't there, then maybe the protesters would be here, so it is understandable,"" she said.
Protesters had occupied the airport from last Friday to protest against the now-abandoned extradition bill and police violence.
The sit-in, originally scheduled for three days, gained renewed momentum on Monday after a female protester was hit in the eye allegedly with a beanbag round fired by police during a ­protest on Sunday.
All flights leaving the airport after 4pm on Monday were cancelled as protesters flooded both terminals. On Tuesday, the airport became a battleground as protesters again blocked passengers from departing and held two mainland men for hours.
There were violent clashes between police and protesters at night. One policeman drew his firearm after he was surrounded by protesters.
Nearly 1,000 flights were cancelled as a result of the partial shutdown."
South China Morning Post,2019-11-23,Police chief urges peaceful end to siege as more protesters surrender Dozens still holed up in campu,776 ,"
Hong Kong's new police chief ­yesterday said there was no ­deadline for dealing with protesters ­barricaded inside Polytechnic University, as he urged them to come out so the crisis could be ­resolved peacefully.
Commissioner of Police Chris Tang Ping-keung appealed to the holed-up protesters after several more emerged overnight from the campus, which has been under police siege since Sunday.
Dozens of radicals were still believed to be holed up on the Hung Hom campus yesterday as the stand-off with police entered its sixth day.
In his first public comment on the issue since taking charge of the 31,000-strong force, Tang highlighted the importance of a peaceful resolution as he warned the campus was becoming increasingly dangerous.
He also promised not to arrest minors or those with immediate medical needs on the spot. Those who were over 18 would be arrested straight away, he added. Tang said the force reserved the right to arrest underage protesters later.
""We hope to end the matter peacefully. We have not set any deadline,"" he said during a visit to the Police Sports and Recreation Club in Kowloon Tong.
""There are many explosives and petrol bombs inside. The conditions are deteriorating. To the people who remain inside, I think you do not want your family members, friends and visitors to be worried. I hope you can come out as soon as possible and solve the matter peacefully.""
More than 1,000 people have been arrested or had their details recorded - including 300 who were under 18 years old - since police besieged the campus.
The development came as US President Donald Trump claimed that Beijing would have sent troops into Hong Kong and killed ""thousands of people"" if it was not for him. ""If it weren't for me, Hong Kong would've been obliterated in 14 minutes,"" he said during a phone interview with Fox News.
""We have to stand with Hong Kong, but I'm also standing with President Xi. He's a friend of mine, he's an incredible guy,"" Trump said. ""The only reason he doesn't go in is because he doesn't want it to affect the trade deal.""
Among the protesters believed to be at PolyU last night were several secondary school students who could not be located by their principals during a visit yesterday.
In the early hours of yesterday, the protesters were offered a way out by self-proclaimed medical assistants, who entered the grounds about 12.30am. They said police handed them a numbered card.
It was not known who authorised the passage of these first-aiders, who claimed those who followed them out could go straight into an ambulance and be exempted from ­immediate arrest.
""We just want to get people out safely without being shot or beaten by Raptors [members of the police Special Tactical Squad],"" one in the group said. ""We will call ambulances for them if they want to leave and they won't be arrested by police.""
It was understood that six of the eight people who left with the group were sent to the hospital.
A senior police source said the force had never invited first- ­aiders to PolyU to convince the protesters to surrender. Instead, many politicians and medical groups approached the force, hoping to enter the premises to speak to those still inside or offer them medical assistance.
""For medical volunteers, we only allowed those coming from reputable organisations to enter. We collected their personal data before they got in,"" the source said.
A third-year student at PolyU, who gave his name as John, said he had tried and failed three times to escape through ­police cordons since Sunday, but would not give up. ""I won't surrender myself to police because I have already stayed here for this long. My ­parents are of course worried and have suggested escape routes to me before, but none of them worked,"" the 21-year-old said.
A protester known as ""the cook"" because he operated the canteen to feed fellow protesters, said he was prepared to be the last one to leave.
Dr Arisina Ma Chung-yee, president of the Public Doctors' Association, said none of the emergency medical workers who were arrested on Sunday when they left the campus had been charged. She said at least six to seven doctors were detained in a police station for 24 hours and were released on bail.
Dr Darren Mann, a surgeon who provided medical help to protesters in the campus on Sunday, described the situation as a ""complex humanitarian crisis"".
Mann, who had experience working in war zones, recalled the scene when he saw a group of medical workers detained by ­police. ""A whole team of medical emergency providers was sitting on the floor, with their hands zip-locked behind their backs,"" Mann said. ""I was horrified.""

South China Morning Post,2019-08-11,Filipino helpers 'choose to stay' despite unrest,398 ,"
More than 95 per cent of Filipino domestic helpers would not consider leaving Hong Kong despite a potential Philippine government ban on sending workers to the city because of the ongoing protests, a survey has found.
The results of the poll came after Silvestre Bello III, the Philippine labour secretary, said last week that Manila might suspend sending its nationals to work in Hong Kong after a Filipino citizen was arrested in a recent protest.
The arrested Filipino, who works as a dancer at Hong Kong Disneyland, said he was passing through the protest site on his way for food but was wearing black, the protesters' preferred colour.
The Philippine government advised Filipinos to avoid protest sites and not to wear black or white clothing, which may be associated with protesters or triad gangs. There are more than 200,000 Filipino domestic helpers in the city.
The survey of 982 Filipino ­domestic helpers was conducted by HelperChoice, a platform for recruiting foreign workers in Hong Kong.
The poll found that 97 per cent of the Filipinos questioned would not consider relocating or going back to the Philippines because of the potential government ban. Of those surveyed, 52 per cent said they were not worried by the protests, while 45 per cent said they were worried but not enough to leave Hong Kong.
One participant said: ""In my opinion, you should just avoid the places where protests are located and avoid wearing white or black during the day of protests - and you will be fine.""
Even so, 64 per cent of those polled said their personal life had been affected by the protests ­during their days off. Sixteen per cent said their daily work was disturbed.
The researchers of the poll wrote: ""For the most part, foreign domestic workers have one day off a week on Sunday and now need to adapt their usual activities due to the events. ""
Some 65 per cent said they had seen one or more of the protest marches, and 70 per cent said they had discussed the situation with friends. More than 60 per cent said they had brought the subject up with their employers, and 55 per cent said they had discussed the unrest with relatives at home.
HelperChoice said a Philippine ban would have a huge impact. The recruiting firm cited a recent study that found that foreign domestic workers contributed 3.6 per cent to Hong Kong's gross domestic product last year, or at least HK$98.7 billion."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-15,Airport battles to return to normal after mayhem Court limits demonstrations at aviation hub as viol,950 ,"
Hong Kong's airport struggled to pick up the pieces yesterday after securing a court order to clear out ­protesters who had grounded nearly 1,000 flights, and a day ­earlier unleashed ­unprecedented violence that prompted ­widespread condemnation.
Beijing and local officials, ­residents and tourists, as well as business and international aviation groups denounced the ­actions of the protesters who had cable-tied, beaten and tormented for several hours two mainlanders whom they accused of being spies and clashed with riot police.
Beijing officials overseeing the city's affairs compared their ­actions to those of terrorists, and said the radical protesters had ""totally breached the bottom line of the law, morals and humanity"".
Before the mayhem on ­Tuesday night, the aviation hub, one of the world's busiest, went to the High Court for an injunction to ban demonstrations in all but two designated zones at the ­arrivals hall.
The full impact of the five-day protest emerged when the Airport Authority revealed yesterday that 979 flights were cancelled ­between Friday and Tuesday, 421 of them on Tuesday alone.
With tourism taking a hit, ­Secretary for Commerce and ­Economic Development Edward Yau Tang-wah announced that hotel operators would soon roll out ­special complimentary ­accommodation for tourists ­affected by the airport closure.
Yau revealed the number of visitors had dropped by around a third in the first 10 days of ­August, compared to the previous year.
The police warned that those who disrupt the safe operations of the airport or cause serious injuries to anyone on the premises could face life imprisonment.
At the airport yesterday, the Airport Authority posted the ­formal notice detailing the court order, effectively a ban which prohibits ""inciting, aiding, and/or abetting"" any unlawful and wilful obstruction of proper use of the airport.
In a statement, the authority said: ""Any person who neglects to abide by ... the interim injunction order may be held in contempt of court, and is liable to imprisonment or a fine.""
Airport staff were on high alert as crowd control measures were put in place and departing travellers had to have their bags checked before they could enter the terminal.
Others had to stay outside the arrivals hall to wait for relatives and friends, while about 60 protesters remained at the hall, marking the sixth straight day of protests at the airport.
On Tuesday, thousands of protesters had occupied the ­departures area, triggering the closure of check-in counters after 4.30pm.
As night fell, two mainland men were detained by the protesters, tied with cables and assaulted over several hours. They were accused of being undercover agents, but one was later confirmed to be a journalist with state-run Global Times while the other was said to be a Shenzhen resident seeing off friends.
In a radio programme, some callers condemned the detention of the two mainland men, ­describing it as ""mob behaviour"". ""The government should impose a curfew in Hong Kong,"" one of them said.
Airport Authority CEO Fred Lam Tin-fuk said, in future, ­protesters would have to obtain a letter of no objection from the ­police and approval from the authority before any demonstration could be held in designated zones.
In a separate briefing, police announced that five men, aged 17 to 28, were arrested at the airport on Tuesday on suspicion of being in an unlawful assembly.
The force also accused two of the five of assaulting police ­officers and being in possession of offensive weapons. None was ­involved in the assaults on the mainlanders.
Chief Superintendent John Tse Chun-chung from the Police Public Relations Branch warned that, under the city's aviation laws, a person could be jailed for life if he caused or was likely to cause serious injuries or death to anyone at the airport. A life sentence could also be applied if a person disrupted the safe operations of the airport, he added.
Even if the protesters were merely holding their hands up and using their bodies to stop travellers from moving around in the airport, as they did on Tuesday, Tse said they could be charged with false imprisonment, a crime that carries a maximum jail term of seven years.
Mak Chin-ho, assistant commissioner of police in charge of operations, condemned the radical protesters' behaviour. ""They took justice into their own hands and harshly attacked some innocent visitors. I am sure all Hong Kong citizens will not turn a blind eye to such violence,"" he said.
In the aftermath of Tuesday's chaos, some protesters took to social media to apologise for their behaviour in the airport, and pledged to reflect on their actions.
The protesters' apology proved too late for the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) under the State Council, China's cabinet, which ""strongly condemned"" the ­protesters for the assaults, likening their actions to ""nearly acts of ­terrorism"".
""The radical protesters have totally breached the bottom line of the law, morals and humanity,"" HKMAO spokesman Xu ­Luying said in a statement. ""Their ­behaviour was in extreme contempt for laws, and they have seriously tarnished Hong Kong's international image."" 
Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong went further in a statement, saying the protesters' actions were ""no different from violence conducted by terrorists"".
The News Executives' Association condemned irrational and violent acts against journalists, saying no one should mistreat journalists doing their work.
Meanwhile, late last night ­protesters and police clashed in the working class district of Sham Shui Po, and several rounds of tear gas were fired.

South China Morning Post,2019-08-25,"petrol bombs and Tear gas return after week's respite Eastern Kowloon becomes battleground, with 28",919 ,"
Tear gas and violence returned to the streets of Hong Kong after a week's respite as police and ­protesters battled each other ­district by district across eastern Kowloon.
The skirmishes lasted from early afternoon well into the night, spreading from the streets of ­industrial heartland Kwun Tong to nearby commercial and residential blocks. In a by-now familiar pattern, the protesters threw bricks, petrol bombs, corrosive liquid and other projectiles at the police, who responded with tear gas, pepper balls and sponge ­grenades.
Twenty-eight people were ­arrested, including an organiser of an approved protest march.
Many onlookers were caught in the crossfire, with some restaurants at Telford Plaza in Kowloon Bay, a main battleground, having to evacuate customers from their dinner tables. As the political ­crisis triggered by a now-shelved extradition bill enters its 12th consecutive week, there is no end in sight.
After last Sunday's massive but peaceful rally, when hundreds of thousands of people - or 1.7 million according to the organiser - braved torrential rain to show the movement could regain its peaceful moorings, there was some hope for peace. For eight days, there was no tear gas.
But when she faced the press on Tuesday, Chief Executive ­Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor did not respond directly to the protesters' five demands, including complete withdrawal of the bill and setting up an independent inquiry to look into alleged police brutality. Instead, she proposed to form a ""platform for dialogue"".
Yesterday, 19 community leaders and politicians gathered at Government House to brainstorm a solution. More than half urged the embattled Hong Kong leader to launch a public inquiry to allow meaningful dialogue to take place, the Post has learned.
Lam did not dismiss the idea but told them it was not the right time to do so as Hong Kong first needed to return to peace and normality.
Meanwhile, the central government gathered its top experts on Hong Kong affairs to neighbouring Shenzhen to discuss how to resolve the crisis. According to state media, the seminar heard that Hong Kong must end the violence itself or Beijing would ­""intervene"".
""The People's Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong are not scarecrows. They are a key part of ensuring the principle of 'one country, two systems' is being implemented in Hong Kong,"" Maria Tam Wai-chu, a heavyweight pro-Beijing politician from Hong Kong, was quoted as saying.
That message was lost on the hundreds of protesters who barricaded part of Wai Yip Street in front of the Ngau Tau Kok Police Station after an approved protest march through Kwun Tong early yesterday afternoon.
The crowds vented their anger on some newly installed ""smart lamp posts"" fitted with sensors, closed-circuit cameras and data networks. While the government said the multifunctional lamp posts were used to collect data on air quality, traffic and weather, the protesters saw them as surveillance tools.
They systematically vandalised the posts one by one, the crowd cheering after dozens of masked protesters managed to topple one of them by sawing off the metal base and pulling it down with ropes.
As protesters faced off with scores of riot police, tempers began to fray. Some threw bricks and water bottles at officers, and at 4.30pm, police unfurled a red banner warning the crowds to disperse or face the use of force.
The police special tactical squad, or Raptors, suddenly charged at the protesters, wrestling several of them to the ground and making arrests. Amid the chaos, some demonstrators threw projectiles and a petrol bomb at the officers, who fired pepper balls, sponge grenades and eventually tear gas in return.
The protesters quickly retreated via a footbridge to nearby district Kowloon Bay, where they occupied the podium of Telford Plaza - a major commercial and residential complex.
From a height, protesters threw projectiles and at least two petrol bombs at the police, who answered with tear gas. Some bystanders were affected and had to be taken away to receive first aid.
After several rounds of clashes, police gradually dispersed the protesters, who retreated to Choi Hung, where many of them went into the subway station and took the train to Wong Tai Sin. There, protesters occupied a major thoroughfare and continued their fight - again making use of the city's railway system to play cat and mouse with police.
Even before the chaos broke out, the MTR Corporation suspended train services at some stations, citing the safety of passengers and staff. The railway operator has become a target of the protesters, who have accused it of siding with police.
Notices were put up at all ­stations on Friday night after the MTR Corp secured a court injunction banning people from ""unlawfully and wilfully obstructing or interfering with the proper use of stations and trains"".
In an open letter addressing service disruptions and the closure of several train stations on the Kwun Tong line yesterday, Adi Lau Tin-shing, the MTR Corp's operations director, defended the arrangements and condemned acts of vandalism by anti-government protesters.
""We had no choice but to do so due to safety reasons,"" Lau said.
He said protesters had in the past few weeks vandalised the railway operator's property, destroying its CCTV cameras and spray-painting graffiti at stations.
Earlier in the day, an attempt to cause disruption at Hong Kong International Airport fizzled out, but the protesters vowed they would try again next week.

South China Morning Post,2019-08-28,Young people who spoke to Lam 'had taken part in rallies' Chief executive met moderate protesters be,595 ,"
Most of the young people who on Monday spoke with Chief ­Executive Carrie Lam Cheng ­Yuet-ngor in a landmark dialogue session had taken part in anti-government marches, organisers of the meeting have told the Post.
Officials stuck to the government's plan to meet first with moderate young protesters ­before reaching out to more vocal and radical activists, a source familiar with plans to start a citywide dialogue platform said yesterday.
Several leaders of the youth groups who organised the meeting said they were open to similar events to allow senior officials more opportunities to exchange ideas with protesters.
The youth groups involved ­included the Outstanding Young Persons' Association, the Hong Kong Playground Associations and the Junior Chamber International Hong Kong.
""We discussed the idea late last week and government officials were interested in such an ­arrangement,"" said Dr Eugene Chan Kin-keung, vice-chairman of the Outstanding Young Persons' Association.
Lam on Monday afternoon held a closed-door meeting with about 20 protesters, most of whom were in their 20s and 30s. She was accompanied by Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung and Secretary for Home Affairs Lau Kong-wah.
Chen Lin, director general of the youth department of Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong, also attended the meeting.
The three youth groups said they invited young people from various backgrounds to attend the meeting.
Edward Leung Wai-kuen, executive director of the Hong Kong Playground Associations, said the government expressed a desire to speak directly with young people who had taken part in protest marches, including ­rallies against the now-shelved extradition bill.
""The ongoing political crisis can't be resolved simply by ­suppression,"" Leung said. ""It's good that the government is ­willing to understand the views of young people.""
Casper Wong Chun-long, the deputy chairman of centrist group, Third Side, who attended the meeting with Lam, said he joined the marches in June but he disagreed with the violent protests of recent weeks.
Since June, Hong Kong has been rocked by anti-government protests sparked by the unpopular extradition bill. In the weeks that followed, protesters settled on five main demands, including the formal withdrawal of the bill and an independent inquiry into the actions of police.
Lam last week again rejected the protesters' top demands, but offered to create the platform for dialogue. ""It is not a question of not responding, it is a question of not accepting those demands,"" Lam said yesterday before meeting her Executive Council.
She said the outbreak of violence and radical tactics made it inappropriate for the government to accommodate the demands.
Wong said: ""The government should take smaller steps, such as withdrawing the bill first and launching an independent inquiry. Protesters should give the ­government some room by not insisting that it meet all their ­demands.""
The source familiar with the dialogue plan agreed the government should meet certain ­demands - like launching an ­independent inquiry - to help jump-start the dialogue process.
On Monday, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said the government had studied the French government's response to ""yellow vest"" protests. The ­protests began in November to oppose fuel-tax increases.
The source said: ""[President Emmanuel] Macron launched the nationwide dialogue after withdrawing the fuel-tax hikes. It would be very difficult for the dialogue in Hong Kong to bear fruit if the government refuses to meet any of the protesters' demands."""
South China Morning Post,2019-10-23,"From weekday pupils to weekend warriors Tens of thousands of students, some as young as 12, are pres",2756 ,"
On weekends, Sophia never leaves home without a collapsible grey bucket in her backpack. It is not that she is an avid gardener or needs the pail for washing up after a picnic.
Sophia is a teenage tear gas soldier. During clashes with ­police, she swoops in with her bucket filled with water and coolly throws hot canisters into it using industrial gloves. Barely exchanging glances, her squad of two or four black-clad comrades moves in coordinated fashion to snuff out the rounds as they land. It is back-breaking work, given that police have so far fired more than 5,100 rounds over the past 4½ months.
Sometimes when she has time to look up and check the riot ­police on the other side, she flings a canister back at them. ""I want to protect others as I know how painful it is to be gassed,"" she said.
At 17, Sophia is one of the tens of thousands of teenagers who make up the backbone of the movement. They give up their weekends to press on with the protests, week after week, risking tear gas, beanbag rounds, rubber bullets, sponge-tipped pellets and the metal batons of the riot police. What about the arrests of more than 2,600 of their comrades and the injuries sustained by ­hundreds others? Bring it on, they seem to say.
University students have ­typically been in the forefront of social movements the world over. In Hong Kong, it has been no different except that the undergraduates have been joined by spirited teenagers such as Sophia. Secondary school students, some as young as 12, also fuel the protests with an idealism and innocence - if not naivety - that in turn draws the sympathy and guilt of older adults that these young people could be trading their future for seemingly impossible dreams of democracy and a Hong Kong with its own distinct characteristics.
Their yearnings as revealed on their social media imagine a city where people speak Cantonese, patronise family-run shops and not chain stores and pharmacies catering to mainland tourists, and care for one another in close-knit communities. Guides online provide a list of ""yellow"" restaurants and stores - the colour symbolising democracy in Hong Kong - that protesters should support.
It is of a Hong Kong lost over the years with more mainlanders and rapid development that brought wealth to the upper crust and left many others feeling out of place in their own city.
For now though, the heady ­romance of this reimagined Hong Kong has to reckon with the harsh reality of being on the front lines. Two teenagers, aged 18 and 14, have been shot, one in the chest, the other in the leg. The injuries young people have ­suffered have added to the collective anger and guilt among Hongkongers. The biggest danger, however, is how a protest movement made up of the very young is fertile ground to breed a permanent opposition to those in power in the city if they are not won over.
On weekdays, Sophia is a bookish secondary school pupil in her pristine white uniform. Bespectacled and barely 150cm tall, her hair is in a ponytail and her backpack sports a soft toy pig keychain. She enjoys reading Chinese literature when she is not busy with her school's debating team. She wants to be a lawyer someday.
On weekends, Sophia dons her helmet, and black outfit and speaks like a detonation expert. ""The fastest way to cool down a [tear gas] round, actually, is to place the canister in a bottle and shake it with mud,"" she said, adding she also knew how to tell apart the sound of tear gas being fired from that of other pellets being dispensed. She had also chosen extinguishing tear gas as her core skill because she was too small to hurl bricks, she said.
Back on July 1, she was among those who stormed into the legislature as the city marked the 22nd anniversary of the city's return to Chinese rule. ""I knew I was not gutsy enough to deface the city's emblem and so I decided to stay in the antechamber and remind our comrades not to vandalise the ­antiques there,"" she said.
Initially, government sources said they had hoped the protests - which began in ­opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill - would die down with the new school year in September. That has not happened. Instead, secondary school students organised class boycotts and human chain protests outside their campuses.
After school, they still flood shopping malls. Instead of lolling about, however, they labour over posters to put up all over the city and launch flash mobs to sing the protest anthem Glory to Hong Kong or to shout slogans.
""Five demands!"" a young masked student, sitting at the ­atrium of Yoho Mall in Yuen Long, chanted as she raised her right hand on a Friday afternoon. ­Passers-by responded just as loudly: ""Not one less!""
One of the most frequently chanted slogans, the demands are for the government to withdraw the extradition bill, stop categorising the June 12 protests as riots, launch an independent probe into police's use of force, pardon all arrested demonstrators and implement universal suffrage. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has only ­acceded to the first demand.
Like Sophia, 16-year-old ­Bosco started out as a peaceful protester. But the Yuen Long attacks of July 21, when a mob of white-clad men attacked passengers and protesters inside the MTR station, changed all that. ­Police showed up 39 minutes after a report was made, sparking accusations of collusion with ­triads. From that day, both felt violence was justified.
""If the law enforcers are breaking the law, I don't think they are qualified to say what we do is wrong,"" Bosco said.
But the bigger mission, he said, was not just to hold the police to account but also to push for a Hong Kong with its freedoms ­preserved and democracy as promised in the Basic Law, the city's mini-constitution.
Hong Kong identity, not independence, mattered most to those whom the Post spoke to.
Too young to have taken part in the Occupy protests of 2014 when pro-democracy supporters staged a 79-day mass sit-in, for these teens, these past four months have been their defining moment to make a difference.
Sacrifices had to be made, they said. Lunch and pocket money have to be squirrelled away to buy protest gear. Hobbies have to wait and weekend activities must lie hidden from the ­prying eyes of parents and friends. Arguments with family are frequent. Beatings when confronting police are an unavoidable risk.
Seventeen-year-old Henry dreams of studying for a sports science degree and hopes to join the basketball team in university. But in summer he did not attend a single training session.
The student recalled a painful moment when he begged his father to delete all the conversations and pictures with him on his phone before travelling to the mainland. Reports of Hong­kongers being asked by mainland ­immigration to unlock their phones for checks of protest ­activity spooked him.
""He only deleted it after I ­refused to let go of his arm. I had never before grabbed my dad's arm like this. I wanted to cry,"" he recalled. ""He is supposed to be a good citizen in the eyes of the Communist Party and should not be dragged into any trouble,"" he said of his businessman father, a law-abiding citizen who is against any attempt to take on Beijing.
On August 24, at a Kwun Tong protest, Sophia was hit by Special Tactical Squad officers with batons and injured her waist. She managed to wrestle free but dared not visit a doctor for fear of being reported to police. She turned ­instead to a volunteer Chinese medicine practitioner through the encrypted messenger app Telegram.
""It would be imprudent for me to say I am ready for a 10-year jail sentence at this moment,"" ­Sophia replied when asked if she was prepared for the worst. ""I dare not say it would be worthwhile, but I will say I have no regrets if this is the risk I must bear.""
Henry said most of the protesters were ordinary students not eyeing a career in politics. ""Not everyone is Joshua Wong Chi-fung or Edward Leung Tin-kei. Not everyone can turn the jail terms they served into political capital,"" he said, referring to the poster boys of youth activism.
Bosco was clear-eyed when he said: ""The efforts would be worth it if we win, but not if we lose.""
But the increasingly dangerous stand-offs with police had sometimes also been thrilling, they admitted, making weekends an almost addictive activity.
Henry, a fit athlete, gave a sheepish smile as he recalled how he felt he was in a ""Korean drama"" when he had to sweep a female teammate into his arms and rescue her from tear gas.
For Bosco, who described himself as an introvert, the feeling of unity on the front lines is intoxicating. No one from his school or family would have thought he would be a hard core protester, he said.
""In a group, we hurl bricks ­together,"" he said. ""Wouldn't you be happy if you get to hit a police van?""
Henry, who used to manage supply stations at protest sites, said he had received more than 100 requests from lower-form ­pupils for gas masks that he had turned down - including from some as young as 12.
""As we chant slogans in school, some of the ­pupils who have no idea about what's going on would also join. I am not hardhearted enough to let them go this far,"" he said.
While there have yet to be findings suggesting hard-core protesters are getting younger, political scientist Dr Samson Yuen Wai-hei, of Lingnan University, said the secondary school students' involvement in the protests was unprecedented.
Almost two-fifths of the 12,231 protesters cumulatively polled in 19 protests from June to August were younger than 24 and about 11.8 per cent of them were 19 or below.
Some 22.2 per cent of them were aged between 25 and 29 while those in their 30s made up less than one-fifth of those surveyed by a team of university researchers, including Yuen.
In a separate study Yuen did at a students' rally in September, 85 per cent of the 230 respondents said they had been involved in the anti-bill movement before July 1.
He also found that anti-bill concern groups had mushroomed on Instagram in more than 390 out of the city's 472 local secondary schools since August.
""The findings suggest that secondary school pupils have participated in the movement at a fairly early stage in their personal capacity and they have tried to bring the cause to school campuses ahead of the new school year in September,"" Yuen said.
The secondary school students were arguably the most organised groups in the movement, which so far appeared to be leaderless, he added.
Yuen highlighted that 28 per cent of the 230 students he polled in a September rally regarded ""having a friend being arrested"" as a critical factor motivating them to carry on the fight. ""It isn't particularly high compared with ­other factors but the fact that 28 per cent have had a friend arrested is significant,"" he said.
Unlike adults, Yuen said young people have a very clear ""black-and-white"" point of view. ""They would stand up if their peers are attacked as it matters to them a lot.""
But the active participation of young students in the increasingly violent clashes with police has taken a troubling turn in ­recent weeks.
On October 1, when the ­People's Republic of China celebrated its 70th anniversary, an 18-year old Form Five pupil who was wielding a white stick and blue shield and fighting with the police was shot in the chest by an officer, becoming the first protester to be hit by a live round in protests. Less than two weeks later, another 18-year old was arrested for slashing a ­policeman's neck from behind with a box cutter during a protest in Kwun Tong.
As of October 21, around 35 per cent of the 2,671 arrested protesters were students, according to figures obtained by the Post from police. One in eight arrestees - or nearly 360 - were secondary school students. Around 140 of them were below 16, with the youngest being just 12 years old. A total of 232 ­people have been charged with rioting, an offence punishable by 10 years in prison. Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung ­described an earlier set of figures released as ""shocking and heartbreaking"".
The young hard-core protesters the Post talked to suggested about 40 per cent of those on the front lines were secondary school students. They move between two ­conflicting worlds - of purposeful study and staging protests. Some make time for university open days to find out how to further their studies, even as they know they might not make it there if they get arrested.
""Secondary school students are here because the city's future belongs to them,"" said Bosco, who will face a university entrance exam next year, as will Sophia.
""Go ask people why they take to the streets. They are still here despite knowing the cost. That's because they know the consequence is not just about a 10-year jail term [for rioting] but the possibility that the Chinese Communist Party will continue to oppress Hong Kong.""
Secondary school students had fewer responsibilities and therefore could do more, Sophia said.
A 38-year-old nurse, surnamed Ho and who has a six-year-old son, said she had supported the movement but thought it unfortunate the protesters' methods had deviated from their original cause and turned to violence. The wills the students have been known to put into their backpacks troubles her the most.
""Young people decide to stand up because they have learned what justice is and they envision their future with hope,"" she said. ""But the moment they put wills in their school bags before going out, they contradict their goal of achieving a beautiful future.""
A retired church employee, surnamed Chan, said she found it heartbreaking and felt guilty to see young people sacrifice themselves on the front lines. Her two daughters, aged 27 and 31, are both frontline protesters. She said she understood why protesters felt compelled to send a signal by vandalising mainland-linked shops but she could not support such actions. ""We should focus on the authorities,"" she said.
Sociologist Dana Fisher, a University of Maryland professor and expert on activism, said young people were more willing to engage in confrontational tactics not because they were immature. Rather, they had less life ­experience and thus were more willing to sacrifice for their cause. She warned, however, that if protesters became violent, it would only yield a more violent response. ""Nobody wins when a movement gets violent. Everybody loses.""
Meira Levinson, professor of education at Harvard University who specialises in civil education and youth empowerment, said young activists were creative, idealistic and not bound by past practice to push for change. But it was also easy for adults to dismiss them as young, foolish or being manipulated by other adults.
Levinson said the city's young protesters should not think they could get everything done all at once or as soon as possible, citing how some activists in the Black Lives Matters movement in the US slowly learned the need to pass on the torch.
""You will just end up killing yourself and you should not do that, especially when those changes will take a very long time and you want to be there for the long change,"" she said.
In recent weeks, the movement has taken a persistently ­violent tilt, as radicals go on rampages. Some have also taken the law into their own hands by beating up those who do not share their views or going after police.
Sophia admitted she feared the movement could spin out of control. ""Some front liners are so emotional these days and I ­seriously don't know what will happen if they catch an officer,"" she said. ""I'm worried not because I think public support is important, but the fact that I don't want to see us going further away from our original goals. 'No rioters but only tyranny' has been one of our ­slogans.""
She has become less active ­recently, after a timely reminder. ""A teacher asked us to think clearly whether what we are doing now could help us play a more influential role in the society in the future as it is going to be a long fight,"" she said.
More than 20 of her 27 classmates have joined the protests, with around half being hard-core participants. Her class teacher created a WhatsApp group asking them to share their status every weekend.
For now, her dream to be a ­human rights lawyer has to be on hold. Sophia has a job to attend to, collapsible bucket in hand.
""What I am doing now and what lawyers do are actually for the same ends - justice. So even if I can't be a lawyer, I have done my part,"" she says.

South China Morning Post,2019-10-06,Mainland outrage at attack on Mandarin speaker,551 ,"
A video showing a Mandarin-speaking JPMorgan Chase ­employee being punched in the face by a protester outside the company's main Hong Kong ­office has provoked outrage on the mainland.
Footage of Friday's incident shows the banker, who was not identified, surrounded by media outside the office in Central while protesters shout at him to ""Go back to the mainland!""
He responds, ""We are all Chinese"", and asks a man in a press vest to show his media pass. The man replies, ""Why do I have to show you my press pass?""
As he tries to make his way into the office building, a protester punches him several times, knocking his glasses off.
It is not clear from the video what sparked the altercation, and there is no indication it was connected to the investment bank.
The video was widely circulated on mainland social media, prompting a flood of angry ­responses.
""Those surrounding the employee are acting like barbarians,"" one person wrote on Weibo.
Another said: ""It's ridiculous. You can't beat people up just because you disagree with them.""
One commenter asked why a mainlander had been surrounded and punched ""just because he said he was Chinese"", while another said the protester's behaviour went against the push for freedom and democracy in the city.
The incident happened just a few hours before the Hong Kong government invoked emergency powers to ban face masks during protests and public assemblies, a move that drew criticism and anger from demonstrators and pro-democracy lawmakers and triggered widespread destruction and violence in the city.
Hong Kong has seen nearly four months of unrest, sparked by a now-abandoned extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to the mainland for trial. The anti-government protests, which have broadened into a pro-democracy movement, have turned increasingly violent.
Protesters accuse the police of brutality, but it has said its use of force - including shooting a teenager in the chest with live ammunition - was reasonable as officers' safety was threatened.
Mainland businesses and those with pro-Beijing connections have also been a focus of the protesters' anger. Demonstrators have smashed Bank of China ATMs and vandalised outlets run by Maxim's Caterers, including American coffee chain Starbucks.
The episode at the JPMorgan Chase office has underscored the challenges faced by international companies as they try to navigate the increasingly fraught environment in Hong Kong.
The protests have put the city on edge, with tensions running high between backers of the demonstrations and those who show sympathy for the Hong Kong government and Beijing.
JPMorgan Chase said in a memo to workers that it was increasing security and that staff should avoid the building over the weekend.
""Some of you will be aware of an incident today that occurred outside our Chater House office involving an employee,"" JPMorgan Chase said in the memo, which was seen by Bloomberg.
""We want to reiterate that we have put in place additional security for all of our buildings and continue to closely monitor the situation in Hong Kong.
""Non-essential employees who are planning to work over the weekend should not come into the office and instead are encouraged to work from home for any necessary weekend work,"" it said.

South China Morning Post,2019-08-24,'Hong Kong Way' forms human chains across city Protesters stand side by side from top of Lion Rock t,699 ,"
Anti-government protesters formed long human chains across Hong Kong last night, standing on pavements in snaking lines that stretched along three railway lines in an unprecedented event they dubbed the ""Hong Kong Way"".
They began at 7pm, flocking outside MTR stations and at other gathering points, from where they spread out over a couple of hours to stand side by side in human chains extending from Kennedy Town to Causeway Bay, from Kowloon Tong to Yau Ma Tei, along the Tsim Sha Tsui harbourfront, and from Tsuen Wan to Lai King, as well as further east along the Kwun Tong line.
Others trekked up Lion Rock, the city's famous ­natural landmark, where they turned on their flashlights and used laser pointers to create a spectacular sight.
""Hongkongers, add oil!"" they chanted, ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times!""
Social worker Tom Tse, 42, said he wanted to invoke the ""Lion Rock spirit"" of Hongkongers' ­tenacity and perseverance during hardship.
Shanna, 9, was one of the youngest to make it all the way up. ""My mother forced me to come,"" she said as she cheered others who made it to the top.
A 33-year-old civil servant who asked to remain anonymous said, ""It takes time and stamina to climb up Lion Rock, just like the hardships we are going through in this movement.""
Organisers had estimated that 44,000 people were needed to form a 45km Hong Kong Way and attract global attention to their campaign.
They were pushing for their five core demands which the ­government has rejected so far: a formal withdrawal of the ­now-abandoned extradition bill which sparked the current crisis; an amnesty for those ­arrested; a commission of inquiry into the use of force by police; a ­retraction of protests being ­characterised as riots; and the ­revival of the city's stalled political reform process.
They were also marking the 30th anniversary of the Baltic Way mass demonstration, when about 2 million people from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania formed a ­human chain spanning about 680km across the three states in their push for independence from the Soviet Union in 1989.
In 2013, an estimated 1.5 million people also came together in Spain to form the 400km Catalan Way as they called for the independence of Catalonia.
However, the Hong Kong Way participants said they were not calling for the city's independence - Beijing has drawn a red line against separatism.
Protesters on Hong Kong Island formed a continuous ­human chain stretching from Kennedy Town to Shau Kei Wan.
At 9pm, many responded to online messages to cover their right eye while chanting, ""Black cops, return the eye!""
They were referring to the case of a young woman who has ­become a rallying symbol of the anti-government movement after she suffered a severe eye injury during a protest outside Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station.
Tim Chan, a 28-year-old banker, said he was aware of the historical context of the Baltic Way protest and the sensitivities where Beijing was concerned, but he ­insisted the Hong Kong Way was more about the five demands of the protesters.
""Beijing has labelled protesters as independence seekers but most of us just want the government to safeguard Hongkongers' rights and freedoms,"" he said.
Social worker Fish Yu, 60, said, ""Beijing knows that most of us are not asking for independence. It was just their excuse to smear our protests.""
Lau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of The Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, a semi-official think tank, said Beijing and mainlanders were likely to find yesterday's protest ""provocative"".
""Beijing is wise enough to know that not everyone who came out understands what the Baltic Way was about, or supports Hong Kong independence,"" he said.
""But the Baltic Way triggered the dissolution of the Soviet Union; Beijing would see this symbolic protest in Hong Kong as a way to attract attention and a sympathetic response from Western countries and media.""
Lau suggested the Hong Kong Way would reinforce Beijing's ­impression that the opposition camp had been colluding with ­external forces and local separatists in orchestrating the protests.

South China Morning Post,2019-10-30,Community service for man who desecrated flag,474 ,"
The first protester to admit to ­desecrating the Chinese flag ­""out of fun"" during anti-government protests was yesterday ­sentenced to 200 hours of ­community ­service.
Sha Tin Court heard Law Man-chung, 21, on September 22 threw a national flag into the air, ­trampled on it and then threw it into a rubbish bin that was later pushed into a pool.
The air-conditioning apprentice pleaded guilty earlier this month to one count of desecrating the national flag, an offence punishable by up to three years in jail and a HK$50,000 fine.
His case was the first of nine ­arrests over flag-related offences to be prosecuted since protests broke out over the now-withdrawn ­extradition bill.
Pre-sentencing reports said it was Law's first offence, and ­depicted him as a responsible worker supported by his family and employer. The probation officer recommended Law do 80 to 160 hours of unpaid community service to give back to society and strengthen his civic awareness.
Magistrate Li Chi-ho said the offence was serious, but it was ­fortunate Law's case did not ­involve more dangerous antics such as burning the flag.
Li adopted the recommendation for community service but ­increased it to 200 hours to reflect the seriousness of the offence.
The flag in question had been removed from the flagpole at Sha Tin Town Hall earlier on September 22 by unknown protesters, who together with the defendant gathered in Sha Tin to protest against the government.
Prosecutors said the flag was later taken to the New Town Plaza shopping centre, where Law joined others in throwing and repeatedly trampling on it while chanting slogans. Some protesters sprayed the flag with black paint and unknown liquid.
Law and the others then displayed it in the outdoor area of the shopping centre's third floor before dropping it to the ground. They then threw it into a rubbish bin that was later pushed into a pool at Sha Tin Park. The flag was later thrown into Shing Mun River before finally being recovered.
Upon his arrest that night, Law admitted to desecrating the flag ""out of fun"", the court heard.
Police said they were investigating nine cases of flag desecration. The first took place on July 1, when protesters replaced the ­national flag outside the Legislative Council with a black version of Hong Kong's bauhinia flag.
A month later, four men and a woman were arrested for throwing a national flag - taken from one of the five flagpoles outside Harbour City shopping centre in Tsim Sha Tsui - into Victoria ­Harbour on August 3. A similar episode took place two days later.
On August 25, protesters removed a national flag from Kwai Chung Sports Ground and left it on the floor for others to trample on. Two weeks later, solar panel technician Wong Cheuk-lai, 22, was charged for allegedly burning a national flag taken from Tung Chung Swimming Pool on ­September 1."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-12,Understanding the psychology of hate A city being torn apart,3421 ,"
Every evening at Muk Lun Street Playground in Wong Tai Sin, families with ­children and elderly in tow loll about for fresh air and young ­couples dawdle en route home. But last Monday, the area was a battlefield.
As dusk fell, hundreds of agitated young protesters who had gathered there hours earlier were contemplating their next move. They had gone to the working-class district that houses the disciplined services quarters - where police officers and their families live - for a second siege after a first attempt two days earlier. With their helmets, masks and cling film as armour and a seemingly unending supply of projectiles, they succeeded in breaking many of the windows on the second and third floors with bricks.
""Shame on the dirty cops!"" they chanted. ""Police are triads!""
During the night-time siege two days earlier, residents fought back by throwing projectiles - including water bottles, glass ­objects and even plastic bags of excrement - down at the protesters from the windows of the same building.
What began as a protest against the controversial and now-shelved extradition bill has metastasised into deep anger and hatred towards the police force, the government's bogeyman as the administration refuses to accommodate any of the protesters' demands.
The clashes have become almost routinised, with protesters provoking the police and the force responding with tear gas, beanbag rounds and rubber bullets to disperse them. The physical altercations are always accompanied by a haze of profanities fired by both sides. And since last week, confrontations have become more unpredictable, and therefore more dangerous, because of the uncertainty of the playing field, as protesters play a cat-and-mouse game with their guerilla-style tactics, making it hard for police to trap them.
The change from fear to loathing was on a slow boil, beginning with the June 12 clash outside the Legislative Council, when police used tear gas for the first time since the start of the opposition to the bill and resorted to rubber bullets that hit protesters and a journalist. Pictures depicting ­""police brutality"" spread like wildfire online. By July 21 and many clashes later, another turning point came for the protesters when a white-shirted mob attacked passengers and protesters in Yuen Long MTR station. Police had failed to show up in time, and worse, video clips quickly circulated showing police vehicles in the same area when the men were gathering. If ever they needed ­evidence of police indifference or even collusion, the incident ­offered protesters incontrovertible proof that they capitalised on to win over those who might have otherwise sided with police.
The antipathy has spread across the city and split society into two camps, among colleagues, friends and even within families. The divide might be reminiscent of the tensions during the pro-democracy Occupy movement five years ago that pitted ­police against protesters. That ­enmity was never fully resolved, according to psychologists and political observers. But now, the atmosphere of hate is much worse, and the healing might take years, they warn.
Complicating the situation further is a perceptible shift in Hongkongers' attitudes towards aggression. Where before they were known for their peaceful demonstrations, analysts and surveys suggest they now have a greater tolerance towards the use of force.
""It is very easy for us to be trapped in the 'us versus them' binary ­oppositional mindset amid this type of inter-group conflicts,"" Dr Christian Chan, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong's (HKU) psychology department, said. ""That is not helpful because most political conflicts are complex and do not only entail two parties, one all good and one all evil.""
Families torn apart
Kit's heart sinks whenever he sees a pop-up notification on his phone. He knows it will probably be another message shared by his stepfather in their family ­WhatsApp message group. The stepfather has been assiduously forwarding articles, photos or ­videos that describe the protesters as thugs.
Kit, a 38-year-old editor who declined to give his full name, has taken part in at least half of the protests since June 12.
""I'd always been restrained, until he said those who support the protesters should die,"" Kit said as he recalled one of the many painful rows with his stepfather, a retired policeman.
""I tried to rebuild the trust over the dinner table - but it's useless. As soon as we bid goodbye, he would go back to those pro-police videos circulating online.""
Kit finally decided to quit his family WhatsApp group.
Jacky Lam, a police inspector turned law student, is wrestling with another form of social pressure. His friends on Facebook who sympathise with the protesters keep tagging him in videos or posts that show what they see as police brutality. ""I would just hide them,"" he said, saying he wanted to avoid emotional arguments that would only create greater ­animosity.
Social media is amplifying the city's divisions triggered by the political storm over the extradition bill, according to Dr Paul Wong Wai-ching, a social inclusion academic at HKU's department of social work and social administration.
""Protesters and their supporters post the eye-catching wrongdoings of the officers while the police's supporters play up the misdeeds of protesters,"" he said. ""We used to say a 'photograph is a representation of reality' - but now even video cannot tell the truth.""
On July 30, hundreds of demonstrators besieged Kwai Chung Police Station, where 45 people who had been arrested over the protests a day earlier had been detained. At one point, a sergeant had caused consternation when he pointed a Remington shotgun, loaded with beanbag rounds, at the crowd. He looked like he had gone berserk.
But other videos circulating showed how the protesters had surrounded him and another officer, thrown projectiles and shone lasers at them. He fell to the ground and had his helmet snatched from him, according to videos and the police's account.
It was one confrontation but with vastly different perspectives, shared by opposing camps.
Lokman Tsui, assistant professor at Chinese University's journalism school, said the algorithms of Facebook and most social ­media offer people what they want to see to encourage them to stay longer on the site.
""This makes the social divide worse, because you don't see the viewpoints of the other side, therefore making it more difficult to develop enough of an understanding or common ground,"" he said. ""It might also overstate the extent you think your side is 'right' because you see primarily people you agree with.""
Hong Kong society could be even more polarised if people use Facebook as their primary source of news and rarely get information from elsewhere. According to market research firm Statista, 4.4 million of 7.5 million people in Hong Kong - almost 60 per cent - were on Facebook last year.
Chan, too, feared the echo chambers produced by social ­media could intensify the polarisation of opinions.
""Both protesters and police think that their side is the righteous one and that everyone in their in-group is doing the right thing for Hong Kong,"" Chan said.
""The problem is, on top of the nebulous nature of the current situation, we are only fed a narrow facet of the complex reality. Everyone thinks they are seeing the full and complete picture when in reality no one actually does.""
Social psychologists have a concept called the ""out-group ­homogeneity effect"", where ­people tend to perceive people outside their circles as more ­similar to one another than ­people in their circles.
In the case of Hong Kong, protesters might have a bias of viewing all police officers as equally brutal in handling clashes, whereas the officers would assume protesters are all thugs - and such single-lens perceptions would only widen the rift.
Escalating violence
Hong Kong's summer of dissent is set to continue with no resolution in sight, even as the government seems to be toughening its stance and meting out harsher reprisals against protesters.
On top of the political fiasco, Chan said a potent combination of psychological factors was also working to perpetuate the current inter-group conflict.
""Young people perceive a ­visible common enemy and internalise a messianic mission of defending Hong Kong, their home. Fighting along your band of brothers and sisters, in a clear and present danger, is inherently risky, but also inherently thrilling,"" he said. ""Similarly, police ­officers are also determined to ­defend their comrades who are injured and assaulted. They also think that they possess the noble calling of defending Hong Kong, their home.""
As the protests have dragged on, hostilities between the two blocs - and also the use of violence - have intensified.
Protesters have so far besieged at least 12 police stations across the city, throwing bricks and even petrol bombs at them and leaving expletive-laden graffiti on the walls. They have hurled projectiles at officers on countless ­occasions.
Earlier this month, police arrested eight people, including independence activist Andy Chan Ho-tin, at a unit in an industrial building where they seized 10 baseball bats, 20 sharpened walking sticks, two bows, six arrows, metal balls and several cartons of protective gear - such as helmets, gas masks and arm guards.
The force, meanwhile, has been slammed by human rights observers for inappropriately and excessively firing tear gas without considering the impact on neighbourhoods, even causing senior residents in nursing homes to be affected.
Before clashes earlier this month in Tai Wai and Tsim Sha Tsui, where police again used tear gas, the force had already fired more than 1,800 rounds of it since June to disperse protesters, along with 300 rubber bullets and 170 sponge-tipped rounds.
The escalating violence prompted Edward Leung Tin-kei, a jailed pro-independence figure regarded as a spiritual leader by some extradition bill activists, to weigh in and call on the protesters not to be ruled by hatred.
But the antipathy has already solidified. Hongkongers have become more understanding towards the efficacy of violent protest, marking a significant shift in the city's political values.
In a study jointly conducted by Baptist University, Chinese University and Lingnan University, more than half of 555 demonstrators polled at a Western district rally on August 4 said they should escalate their struggle if the government remained intransigent.
More than 88.8 per cent of them also agreed that the combination of peaceful rallies and clashes would maximise the ­impact of the movement.
There has been method to the mayhem: each protest event starts with a peaceful march, usually attended by tens of thousands, but soon ends with road blockades, stand-offs and sieges of police stations before clashes led by a smaller group of hard-core activists. The peaceful marchers are willing bystanders, cheering the radicals on.
The weeks-long movement, taking in a range of actions, from peaceful protests to more radical steps, has allowed citizens to play roles they are comfortable with, living up ironically to Karl Marx's maxim of ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs"".
""No mat-cutting"" - or in Cantonese bat got zek - has been one of the mantras of the movement, helping to unite the crowd. It is a motto calling on protesters, despite having different approaches, to neither blame nor distance themselves from each other for their common cause.
They have insisted on five demands, notably a complete withdrawal of the extradition bill and an independent probe into the police's use of force in handling protests. While the attendees of the peaceful marches are from a diverse mix of age groups, the frontline activists are mostly in their early 20s.
George Chu, a 40-year-old engineer, said it was a good thing for Hongkongers to be more tolerant over the use of force in protests. ""Police officers, with public power, have been using stronger weapons so it is only reasonable for protesters to escalate their actions,"" Chu said when the Post met him at a Kennedy Town rally on August 4, an event that ended with tear gas again after a group of rally-goers staged another round of spontaneous road blockades.
While co-founders of the ­Occupy movement five years ago cited the civil disobedience movement of Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi and emphasised the importance of love and peace, Chu said taking heed of such advice was inappropriate.
""Gandhi's opponent was Britain,"" he said. ""But we are facing the Communist Party, which will not reason with you.""
But veteran activist Avery Ng Man-yuen of the League of Social Democrats did not believe violence was the solution. (Ng's party is known for its street actions and antics but about the only ""violence"" he ever committed was throwing a tuna sandwich at former leader Leung Chun-ying.)
Escalation of protests would lead not only to more of them paying a price, Ng warned, but could at the same time marginalise the movement as more supporters might not want to get involved further, fearing the cost to themselves. ""And after all, the protesters and the force are in an asymmetrical position - officers are equipped with bullets but protesters only have bricks,"" he said. ""Injuries eventually would be on our side.""
Over the past few weeks, the moderate faction of protesters have felt indebted to the frontline radicals who have been hurt and arrested. To support them, many moderates donated supplies, from food coupons to battle gear such as goggles, masks and ­helmets.
But Ng warned that such well-meaning acts could just end up hurting more protesters, causing more injuries and arrests.
""It's a dilemma. They know the frontline protesters would clash [with the police] anyhow,"" said Ng, who recently ended a prison sentence for leaking details of a corruption investigation into a government official.
""Offering them support might protect them for now but in another sense, it would also appear to be an endorsement of their ­actions.""
Ng said the hatred between the protesters and police was a vicious cycle and criticised the government for allowing the ""inevitable tragedy"" to worsen.
On the impact of their own acts of violence, Ng believed the protesters would not bother to think through the consequences of not having a functioning police force. They genuinely felt the ball was in the government's court.
""We need to find out, did something go wrong at the commanders' level or on the front line? We need an inquiry into the police's operations,"" he said.
""And the administration is the only player that can resolve this deadlock,"" he said. ""Does it want to wait until someone dies?""
Loss of confidence
Chinese University political ­scientist Ma Ngok said Hongkongers' sense of loathing towards the police and their acceptance of disruptive actions - such as road blockades and vandalism - had grown markedly over the past two months.
""They have lost confidence in the police enforcing the law fairly and question the legitimacy of all their actions,"" he said, citing the recent protest against the arrest of a student leader for buying laser pens, which the police deemed ""offensive weapons"".
""They no longer think it's reasonable to blindly obey the law when there is no punishment for the officers' wrongdoings.""
But the shift need not mean the end of peaceful protests in Hong Kong, he said.
""The non-violent protesters still make up the core of the movement,"" he said. ""The radical actions now are stemming from the hatred of the police and the Communist Party. I doubt if they will always resort to such means in the future.""
The deepening divide can be expected to take a toll on residents' mental well-being regardless of their political stance, if past tensions in society are any guide.
A 2015 study, published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, found more than 47 per cent of 1,208 local respondents had reported moderate or severe symptoms of anxiety following the Occupy movement, while 14.4 per cent showed signs of depression. One in 11 reported ""poor' or ""very poor"" health.
Further analysis revealed that respondents who reported ""personal and social resource loss"" were more likely to report higher anxiety and depressive symptoms and greater odds of having ""very poor"" health.
""Such resources could be one's optimism or their relationship and intimacy with others,"" said Dr Hou Wai-kai, director of Education University's centre for psychosocial health, who co-authored the study.
""Social upheavals definitely have a significant impact on the mental health of ordinary ­citizens.""
Agreeing, Wong said everyone was vulnerable at this stage, including those who had not taken sides and stayed silent.
""The people around them, who have taken sides, might slam their inaction as 'not caring about the city'. One wouldn't be better off by staying silent,"" he said.
Wong, also a research fellow at the Hong Kong Police College, ­argued it might be unfair to expect frontline officers to manage their emotions round the clock just ­because they were trained to maintain law and order.
""It would be a legitimate expectation if the society was calm. Officers now, however, are subject to physical and mental abuses, threats and bullying of their family members,"" he said.
The provocations they faced, he admitted, required of them a very high level of self-control and emotional management. Thus, seeing officers swearing at protesters or even reporters was worrying, he said, suggesting they were at the end of their tether.
""They could not or do not bother to control their emotions or take the feeling of citizens into account,"" the clinical psychologist said, citing such incidents as evidence that officers also needed to be better trained and have more attention paid to their ­mental well-being.
Wong urged the government to consider launching a pilot dialogue by inviting respected figures to take part in it, before broadening it to include wider sections of society. ""Such a dialogue is likely to be conducted in a peaceful and rational manner, as you can ­control what's going to happen,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Chan, also a clinical psychologist, urged Hongkongers regardless of where they stood politically to reach out to their social circles for emotional support, spend time with family and friends and re-establish healthy everyday habits.
Those feeling tired from watching the never-ending loop of clashes and clearances should take a break from social media and tune out sensational feeds from their news diet. He also advised Hongkongers and the two sides to get more - yes, believe it or not - sleep.
Young demonstrators had been staying awake at all hours of day and night, keeping track of their activities on encrypted messenger Telegram and reddit-like site LIHKG - an online forum that is effectively a virtual command centre of the movement.
Similarly, police officers, who had been mobilised to multiple locations and sometimes on 17-hour shifts, were also often seen lying on the ground, resting ­wearily after clashes with protesters. ""Numerous scientific research data have suggested that sleep deprivation could amplify biases and affect our ability to think. It also hampers our ability to regulate emotion,"" he said. ""We err more easily when we don't get enough sleep.""
'Mind your language'
Most importantly, though, Chan also appealed to Hongkongers to stop dehumanising each other, such as calling police officers ""dogs"" or protesters ""yellow zombies"". The latter was a derogatory term first popularised during Occupy to describe pro-democracy protesters.
Dehumanisation - the process in which people see the other as less human than their own group - would help justify the use of violence and extreme means, he warned. ""We need to retrieve our common identity,"" Chan said. ""We are first and foremost human beings and Hongkongers before we are protesters or police officers, or supporters of either side. Let us remind ourselves of our common humanity.""
He recalled a line from a hit by English rock band Pink Floyd: ""And after all, we're only ordinary men.""
The title of the song? Us and Them.
So, when can all sides come ­together as one whole again? ­Psychologists such as Chan have no answer.
But perhaps it is when playgrounds can return to being safe spaces, not battlefields. And when the Wong Tai Sin playground where violence broke out last Monday can live up to its name in Cantonese, Muk Lun: ""Harmonious neighbourhoods"".

South China Morning Post,2019-10-13,"Cruz says lam canned meeting out of fear US senator, on visit to Hong Kong , accuses chief executive",571 ,"
One of the United States' strongest critics of China, Republican senator Ted Cruz, has accused Hong Kong's leader of cancelling a scheduled meeting with him out of ""weakness"" and ""fear"" of anti-government protesters.
On a brief visit to Hong Kong yesterday, Cruz said he had met ""non-violent protest leaders"" and impressed upon them the need to shun violence, but insisted he himself had never heard, or seen evidence, of rioting, vandalism and mob attacks over more than four months of civil unrest in the city.
Speaking to reporters at the US consul general's residence on The Peak, Cruz was dressed in black to ""express solidarity with the ­protesters"".
He said he had been looking forward to talks with Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor in the afternoon, but was ­informed when he landed in the morning that the meeting had been cancelled.
""Prior to the meeting being cancelled, Ms Lam's office asked that I agree to keep everything said in the meeting secret and not inform the press of anything she had to say,"" Cruz said.
""She seems to misunderstand how free speech operates and also how freedom of the press ­operates. Ms Lam's cancelling the meeting is not a sign of strength, it's a sign of weakness. It's a sign of fear of the protesters on the streets of Hong Kong.""
The Chief Executive's Office did not respond to his allegations.
Cruz's anti-Beijing campaign has seen him introduce a bill to amend the US-Hong Kong Policy Act, which would require the State Department to certify the city's autonomy if it is to continue enjoying special trade and economic benefits under the existing arrangement.
Cruz and other China hawks in the US Congress are also pushing for the bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which would require Washington to assess whether the city should still be afforded its special status in light of political developments.
A couple of protesters were at Hong Kong's airport to greet him upon arrival and thank him for his support for their cause. They had reportedly bought flight tickets so they would be allowed into the terminal building, which is off limits to protesters after the chaos they caused during previous demonstrations at the arrival and departure halls.
""I recognise that some of the protests have turned violent. There is considerable concern that the protests are being infiltrated by agents of the Chinese government precisely to cause that violence, to turn the protests violent. I don't know if that is happening or not; I can tell you the protest leaders with whom I spoke today believe it is happening,"" Cruz said.
""What I have encouraged the protest leaders with whom I have spoken is to embrace non-violent protest, to follow the tradition of Gandhi in India and Dr Martin ­Luther King in the United States.
""That can be difficult to carry out, it can be particularly difficult in the face of violent oppression by government forces, of police beatings and shootings.""
He went on to level further ­accusations against Beijing.
""There is a reason the ­Communist Party in China wants the Hong Kong protests to turn violent because the Chinese Communist Party very much wants to characterise these protests as violent acts of terrorism rather than democracy protesters standing up for human rights,"" he said.
""But my strong encouragement to the protesters here in Hong Kong is resist the urge to respond to brutality in like kind, but instead stand with dignity."""
South China Morning Post,2019-11-01,Britain calls on HK protesters to 'end the violence',509 ,"
Britain has called on anti-government protesters in Hong Kong to ""end the violence"", while also asking police to ""be ­proportionate"" in their handling of demonstrators.
It also noted that the nature of the protests had changed and stressed that the violence of a ""hard-core minority cannot be condoned"".
Britain's stance was spelt out in its latest six-monthly parliamentary report on Hong Kong, ­released yesterday, which also called on the city's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng ­Yuet-ngor, to look ahead to ""the path towards de-escalation and political resolution"" to break the impasse in its former colony, which has been rocked by ­worsening protests for almost five months.
In a foreword to the 19-page report, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab wrote: ""Protesters must end the violence. The police response must be proportionate in their handling of protesters and safeguard the right to peaceful protests. And there must be a meaningful dialogue between all parties.""
Although the report covers the six-month period up to June 30, Raab made reference to subsequent events in his comments and noted the nature of the protests had changed over the months, ""not only in terms of scale and scope, but also in terms of approach"".
He said: ""Protesters have ­vandalised property and tried to shut down banks, metro stations and the airport. A police officer was injured by a knife, and petrol bombs have been thrown at ­police stations and other targets.""
Raab wrote that ""the UK has always been clear that the ­violence of a hard-core minority cannot be condoned"", as he also expressed ""serious concerns"" about the alleged mistreatment of protesters by Hong Kong police.
Almost a quarter of the report details the course of the social ­unrest that was triggeredby the government's now-withdrawn extradition bill to plug loopholes in fugitive transfer laws.
It includes the case at the ­centre of the crisis, that of Hongkonger Chan Tong-kai, wanted in Taiwan for the murder of his ­girlfriend, the Hong Kong government's bid to speed up the bill's passage in the legislature by ­bypassing the bills committee stage, and Lam's suspension of the bill after 2 million people took to the streets in June in protest.
The bill would have allowed fugitive transfers with jurisdictions Hong Kong does not have an extradition agreement with, ­including the mainland and ­Taiwan.
The movement has also evolved, with the scope of protesters' demands growing to include calls for universal suffrage and even the disbanding of the police force.
Beijing has labelled the ­upheaval as having ""obvious characteristics of a colour revolution"", supported by ""foreign ­forces"", referring to Western countries.
The British report stressed that ""we condemn violence, but ­support the right to peaceful and lawful protest"", and ""the right for people to stand up for their freedoms, as guaranteed under the Joint Declaration"".
The Sino-British Joint Declaration, signed in 1984 between London and Beijing, set out the terms of Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997."
South China Morning Post,2019-07-18,Flight bookings from Asian countries to city drop,528 ,"
Flight bookings from Asian ­countries to Hong Kong have dropped 5.4 per cent in the past month, as waves of extradition protests rocked the city and gave potential visitors reason for ­concern.
The decrease in air travel, ­revealed to the Post yesterday, was another sign of the negative ­economic effects brought by the ongoing mass protests - including drops in mainland tourists, hotel occupancy and retail sales.
The New Zealand government yesterday urged its citizens to monitor Hong Kong media for news on protests and to comply with city authorities. New Zealand advised nationals in the city to avoid rallies and demonstrations, noting ""violent clashes"" had taken place.
""While the numbers do not look good, things are not allbad for Hong Kong's visitoreconomy,"" said Olivier Ponti, vice-president of the businessintelligence group ForwardKeys.
""So far, the adverse media ­coverage of the demonstrations has not caused an overall decline in long-haul bookings to Hong Kong and the number of Asian bookings made in all of 2019 is still ahead of those made during the same time period in 2018 - ­although growth has slowed ­substantially since the mass ­protest of June 16.""
Data compiled by ForwardKeys showed that between June 16 and July 13 flight bookings to Hong Kong from Asian destinations - except the mainland and Taiwan - were down 5.4 per cent from the same period in 2018.
That time period followed a protest on June 9 that drew a turnout of 1 million people, and violent clashes between protesters and police on June 12. On June 16, an estimated 2 million people joined another march against the unpopular extradition bill, which has since been suspended.
From June 15 to June 29, ­according to ForwardKeys, bookings to Hong Kong slumped by 9 per cent. The sharp drop erased growth in the first 6½ months of the year, which saw bookings ­increase by 6.6 per cent from the same period last year.
ForwardKeys warned another downturn in travel bookings was possible.
Tourism sector lawmaker Yiu Si-wing said the impact of the ­protests on the industry was ­obvious. He said the average growth of tourist arrivals to Hong Kong was 13 per cent in the first six months of the year - but the rate in June was 8 per cent, and just 4 per cent for the first five days of July.
""If the conflicts continue, the growth rate will continue to drop in the latter half of this year. The figures might even decrease,"" he said.
Yiu said the downturn could be blamed on the clashes between protesters and police - rather than the protests themselves.
""Hong Kong has hundreds of peaceful protests every year. It is the conflicts and bloodshed that have made tourists feel insecure and worried about travelling to the city,"" he said.
Hong Kong's hotel sector, meanwhile, reported an average occupancy rate drop of 3 to 5 per cent in June compared with the same period last year. Overall revenue dropped 10 per cent in June.
According to Yiu, tourist ­agencies had seen more people from the mainland and overseas cancelling study and business tours over fears their schedule would be affected by the ongoing protests. He said some agencies charged a cancellation rate of 20 to 30 per cent."
South China Morning Post,2019-10-12,Residents form chain in police 'brutality' protest,612 ,"
More than 1,000 residents formed a 2km human chain in Tai Po last night to call for an end to alleged police brutality, as Hong Kong braced for its 19th consecutive weekend of anti-government ­protests.
Hundreds gathered in Sheung Shui, Yau Tong and Tseung Kwan O to mourn a 15-year-old girl who had been reported missing but whose body, it emerged yesterday, was found in the sea last month.
Addressing rumours online that the teenager and others could have been killed by police, acting Chief Superintendent Kelvin Kong Wing-cheung said an ­investigation, including an ­autopsy, found nothing suspicious about her death.
Kong said the girl was not ­arrested during recent protests and there was no wound or any sign of sexual assault on her body, ­although the cause of death was still to be confirmed.
He said surveillance footage from the girl's school showed she left her possessions on the campus before walking barefoot towards the waterfront near Tseung Kwan O on September 19. She was reported missing two days later and her body was found on September 22, he said.
But some protesters were not convinced, and used candles to form the Chinese characters for ""truth"" as they remembered the teenager at the Hong Kong Design Institute in Tseung Kwan O.
At a so-called citizens' press conference yesterday, one protester who did not want to be named said the public could not trust the police's account of the incident.
""Recent cases of death including the 15-year-old girl leave us with many questions, whether they really fell into the sea and killed themselves, or died an ­unnatural death,"" he said.
Elsewhere, there were peaceful protests in a Sha Tin shopping centre, at Ma On Shan and in the Elements mall in West Kowloon.
About 50 demonstrators also gathered outside the Heung Yee Kuk Building in Sha Tin as ­embattled Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, as well as Wang Zhimin, head of Beijing's liaison office in the city, attended a closed-door function before ­leaving in a car.
In Tai Po, protesters formed a human chain from Kwong Fuk Road, crossing a tunnel under Po Heung Bridge to On Chee Road. Many turned on the flashlights on their phones and chanted slogans. ""No more delay to dismissing the police force,"" they shouted.
Yesterday's crowds were smaller than a week ago, when radicals rampaged across the city and vandalised shops and public facilities such as MTR stations in protest at a ban on the wearing of masks at public assemblies.
Lunchtime traffic in Central was disrupted as hundreds of protesters, many of them masked, marched along busy roads following a rally at Chater Garden.
Those who gathered in Central and Tai Po said they were protesting against alleged police brutality and the case of Chinese University student Sonia Ng, who claimed a policeman had hit her breasts after she was arrested on August 31 and detained. Police said they would investigate Ng's claim.
A 24-year-old teacher named Kara, who joined the Tai Po ­human chain, said it was inappropriate for police to ask Ng to file a complaint. ""It would be dealing a second round of damage to ask someone to recount how she was subjected to sexual violence in front of others,"" she said.
In the Elements mall in West Kowloon, about 10 secondary students, most of them masked, brought instruments such as violins and flutes to play the protest anthem Glory to Hong Kong, and sang Do You Hear the People Sing in a flashmob demonstration.
""Hongkongers, resist!"" they shouted.
Messages have been circulating on the internet, calling for people to protest in places such as Tsim Sha Tsui, Sha Tin and Causeway Bay today and tomorrow.

South China Morning Post,2019-07-02,Protests descend into violence for anniversary City marks return to Chinese rule with street battles,709 ,"
Violence erupted on the streets yesterday as the city marked the anniversary of its return to ­Chinese rule, with anti-government protesters storming the legislature after forcing its evacuation for the first time ever.
The mob used makeshift weapons, including a metal cart, bars and panels, to besiege the Legislative Council building in what appeared to be an ­impromptu move.
The mainly young and masked protesters also barricaded key roads in Admiralty and Wan Chai and attacked police with what was suspected to be drain cleaner and caustic soda, and also launched eggs and ­bottles at them in other clashes.
Thirteen officers were sent to hospital for treatment and later discharged.
At the Legco building in ­Admiralty, chaos reigned for half the day. Protesters broke into the car park area of the compound as others tried to smash the glass doors of the main entrance, using metal bars they got from dismantling barricades set up outside the complex.
Some threw bricks and metal rods at the doors, while others heckled police inside. Some ­protesters had wooden sticks.
Shouts of encouragement echoed through the area as ­protesters battered the doors. The security shutters of the main ­entrance were eventually breached but the protesters failed to enter initially, faced with police in full riot gear. But at 9pm, hundreds of protesters swarmed into the then-abandoned legislature, vandalising the premises.
The attack on the main public entrance came about an hour after protesters tried to force their way into the Legco block by ramming a metal cart through a glass door at the members' entrance on the other side of the compound. Police there responded with ­pepper spray.
The protesters' attack was finally successful, leaving a gaping hole in the glass door. But the crowd at that entrance simply left rather than forcing its way in.
Earlier in the day, one protester was reportedly pushed to the ground as he tried to stop others from attacking the building.
Opposition lawmaker Leung Yiu-chung was seen trying to stop the protesters, but was also thrown to the ground.
Other pro-democracy lawmakers, including Roy Kwong Chun-yu and Lam Cheuk-ting, pleaded to the protesters to ­remain peaceful.
In a statement issued at around 7pm, the government said it ""strongly condemns and deeply regrets the extremely violent acts committed by some protesters who stormed the Legislative Council complex"".
A government spokesman said Hong Kong ""is a society that respects the rule of law, and has never tolerated violence"".
""The police will take appropriate enforcement action to protect public order and safety.""
Police also condemned the violence.
At about 6pm, Legco issued a red alert, telling everyone to ­evacuate the building.
The compound is near the government headquarters and the office of Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor. The site has been at the centre of protests in the past few weeks, driven by demands for the withdrawal of a now-suspended extradition bill and for Lam to step down.
It was by far the worst damage at the Legco building since ­November 2014, when radical protesters stormed the legislature, smashing two glass doors at the height of the Occupy protests.
On June 12, some bill protesters clashed with police outside the building, with officers using tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds. The compound ­remained intact.
Yesterday's violence contrasted with the many largely peaceful rallies against the extradition bill in previous weeks.
In one Telegram group of protesters with more than 20,000 members, some expressed disapproval of storming the legislature.
""What's the purpose of smashing the glass?"" one asked in a post. Another message read: ""What are they doing? They have wasted the students' efforts!""
Some blamed the violence on government ""spies"" trying to discredit the protest movement.
There were also calls for more destruction. One post read: ""If we manage to storm Legco, it means we have the ability to overthrow the government. Carrie Lam has been ignoring us because she thinks we are harmless. [This] is meant to tell Carrie Lam: 'If you don't respond to our appeals, we will tear down your house.'""

South China Morning Post,2019-08-14,"Airport rocked by protest violence for the first time Demonstrators step up action, including detain",981 ,"
Defiant anti-government protesters brought unprecedented violence to Hong Kong ­International Airport last night, clashing with riot police after ­severely ­disrupting flights and ­ignoring a tearful warning from the city's leader that they were pushing the city ""into an abyss"" by ­attacking its institutions and ­""destroying the rule of law"".
The late-night chaos came after belligerent protesters spent hours detaining a young man they claimed was an undercover agent from the mainland at the check-in area in the departure hall. He was seen later with his hands secured with cable ties and surrounded by protesters, who would not let paramedics take him away at around 10pm after he lost ­consciousness.
It was another hour before he was taken away in an ambulance, but there was more trouble outside the terminal as protesters turned on police who were there initially to help the ambulance leave. Police vehicles were ­attacked and windows smashed.
A small contingent of fully equipped riot police and elite officers from the Special Tactical Squad fought off the protesters, using pepper spray and batons.
Police were seen rushing into the terminal and subduing some protesters, and injuries were reported on both sides. The stand-off continued into the night.
Galvanised by their success in crippling airport operations and forcing the cancellation of ­hundreds of flights in and out of Hong Kong on Monday, protesters swarmed over the arrival and departure halls again yesterday, ­forcing the closure of check-in counters.
This time, the Airport Authority announced that only passengers who had checked in before 4.30pm could fly out, but incoming flights would be allowed in.
There were chaotic scenes, scuffles and loud arguments as many travellers lost their patience at being blocked or delayed for the second straight day by thousands of mostly young, masked protesters in black who flooded both ­terminal buildings.
Travellers desperate to catch their flights begged to be let past protesters preventing them from entering the restricted departure zone to fly out of Hong Kong.
Scuffles broke out from time to time along a cordon of luggage carts set up by protesters as small groups of agitated travellers tried to push their way through and were shoved back.
A family of three from Thailand, whose flight was cancelled on Monday, were in tears at finding their way blocked again by protesters. ""You can fight with your government, but not me, understand? I just want to go home,"" the mother told protesters while comforting her son. ""We will never come here again.""
Media reports from Thailand said the country's military had planes on standby to evacuate Thai nationals from Hong Kong if necessary.
Eight athletes from the Hong Kong swimming team were let through the picket line after pleading with protesters to ­allow them to fly to Singapore for the World Cup. ""We understand and support what you are doing, but we hope to represent Hong Kong at the World Cup. There aren't that many competition opportunities like this, and I hope you will let us through,"" swimmer Leo Fung told them.
The Travel Industry Council said nearly 100 tour groups from Hong Kong, involving thousands of local holidaymakers, had their trips cancelled or delayed over the past two days.
The protesters were mostly complaining to an international audience about the escalation of force against them by police.
The main theme was their outrage over one of them being hit in the eye, allegedly by a beanbag round fired by police last Sunday - many wore eye patches in a show of solidarity with the injured woman - and the use of tear gas against demonstrators for the first time at two train stations.
The incidents caught the attention of the UN Human Rights Office, which issued a statement urging authorities to immediately investigate the use of ""less-lethal weapons in ways that are prohibited by international norms and standards"".
Police insisted their use of force was justified because of intensifying attacks by protesters who were throwing petrol bombs and firing ball bearings at them with catapults, but they also promised to investigate how the woman suffered such a serious eye injury amid conflicting claims about the incident.
Sources told the Post that, in a change of tactics, police would take swift action to disperse and arrest radical protesters at future anti-government rallies to avoid prolonged stand-offs.
With police stations coming under frequent attack by radicals, they said, cordons would be set up in advance to stop protesters from getting close and the elite Special Tactical Squad would be used against the most violent people.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor defended the police as she condemned the airport chaos, lamenting that the city was no longer safe because of protest lawlessness and violence.
""A lot of residents go out and return to the city [through the airport], and many tourists and businesspeople use this transport hub,"" she said. ""Hong Kong's reputation, as a safe society that respects the rule of law, will be in a very dangerous [situation].""
In a direct appeal to the protesters, Lam choked back tears as she said: ""Let's spend one minute to look at our city and our home. Can we bear to push it into an abyss where everything will ­perish? When this all calms down, we will start to have sincere dialogue and rebuild harmony.""
She was frequently interrupted and yelled at by reporters during a 30-minute grilling.
""Mrs Lam, many residents are asking when you will die!"" one reporter shouted as she was leaving.
A poll from August 1 to 6 by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute found that Lam's support rating had dropped to 27.9 points out of 100, a new low after it hit 30.1 points last month.
More trouble was brewing for the coming weekend, with another mass rally in the pipeline.

South China Morning Post,2019-07-03,Thugs blacken admirable mass movement MY TAKE,410 ,"
When hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong people hit the streets in protests against the government's extradition bill, they did so peacefully and with dignity. The entire world was in awe.
But a subset of those protesters has turned violent on multiple occasions, the latest being their brief occupation and vandalising of the legislature. Their violence has threatened to overwhelm the movement's messages to the world and erode support among locals.
Yet prominent media pundits and opposition politicians continue to make excuses for their most blatant criminal behaviour, preferring to lay all responsibilities on the government and the police. When police intervene, it's brutality. When they don't, they are setting up a trap for protesters to break the law.
Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung, of the Labour Party, actually said on television that the police could have protected the legislature but decided to disperse to let the protesters in and vandalise the place so as to discredit them.
Then you have Lewis Lau Yiu-man, an occasional commentator with the yellow-ribbon outlet Stand News. Writing in The New York Times before the July 1 protests, he said the movement was both peaceful and ""forceful"".
""The use of force, in particular, is a divisive issue,"" he wrote. ""Some insist on the necessity of keeping the protests peaceful, so that they will seem morally legitimate and may gain sympathy from the broader public. Others ... believe that some measure of force has become necessary; otherwise, the government will simply ignore them.
""The 'do not split' idea acts as a bridge between these two factions by promoting mutual respect for diverging views within the protest movement.""
But you can't have it both ways. Either your movement is peaceful or it is not. If you believe peaceful resistance is the right way, then you must dissociate from those who turn to violence. Unfortunately, some people's willingness to tolerate or ignore even blatantly violent acts is encouraging a small, but substantial, number of youngsters to commit crimes. Hooligans and rioters are hiding behind an otherwise admirable mass movement.
I quote an interview in The New York Times: ""We need to let out our long-repressed emotions and to let the rest of the world know about this news,"" said Kris Yeh, a 20-year-old protester who said he had helped smash glass doors and spray-paint walls. This is an inadvertently honest statement from a young hooligan: they need to let off steam."
South China Morning Post,2019-08-11,guerilla-style skirmishes mark new phase in protests Scale and intensity of clashes appear to lessen,905 ,"
Months of social unrest in Hong Kong moved into a new phase yesterday, with both anti-government protesters and police using fresh strategies.
Police again used tear gas and petrol bombs were thrown by demonstrators, who once more had gathered illegally across the city in defiance of protest bans by the authorities. But the scale and intensity of the clashes appeared to have lessened, and there was also a change in how the two sides engaged.
It came after a week when Beijing and the Hong Kong government stepped up support for the city's embattled police force while they clamped down on those deemed sympathetic to the ­protesters.
Hong Kong's biggest carrier, Cathay Pacific Airways, yesterday fired two airport employees for leaking police officers' passenger information to protesters and removed a pilot from flying duties after he was charged with rioting.
The airline took the action in response to unprecedented measures imposed by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) that barred aircrew who joined or supported illegal protests from operating flights going through Chinese airspace.
Meanwhile, former deputy police commissioner Alan Lau Yip-shing, a battle-hardened ­veteran who oversaw operations during the 2014 Occupy protests and the 2016 Mong Kok riot, was brought back to tackle the escalating protest violence.
On the other side, the protest movement - widely described as leaderless and decentralised - has become more fragmented and unscripted, with the numbers dwindling at battlegrounds scattered across the city's north.
Their demands - stemming from protests against Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor's now-shelved extradition bill that would allow criminal suspects to be sent to the mainland - have also evolved. The ""five demands"" in relation to the bill and the wave of protests it triggered are now seldom heard. Instead, from Tai Po to Tsim Sha Tsui, the rallying cry is now ""Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times"".
For hours yesterday, protesters fought guerilla-style battles with police in Tai Po, Tai Wai, Tsim Sha Tsui, Tsuen Wan, Kowloon Bay, Kowloon Tong, Kwun Tong and in front of the Hung Hom Cross-Harbour Tunnel.
These followed a pattern - activists taunted police with verbal abuse and hurled projectiles at them, but quickly dispersed once riot police moved in. Police no longer waited to get into formation before charging at the protesters and the skirmishes were fluid throughout the evening.
Tsim Sha Tsui was the exception, where there was a stand-off between protesters and police after a woman was pinned to the ground by officers and apparently taken away. Scores of people surrounded the police demanding she be released.
The scuffles continued well into the night, with six people ­injured.
But the day began peacefully. Police had rejected all four protest applications for the weekend - in Tai Po and Wong Tai Sin yesterday and North Point and Sham Shui Po today - on the grounds of high risk. The protesters, however, as in previous weekends, were expected to go ahead with their marches.
Tai Po was eerily quiet yesterday morning, with the wet markets closed and most shops shut. At Wong Tai Sin police dormitory - the site of violent clashes a few days ago - residents were seen putting up wooden panels to protect their windows. While nothing happened there, hundreds of people started to gather in Tai Po soon after lunch at a rally that remained peaceful.
The first skirmish happened at about 6pm, when a few hundred protesters broke off from the main crowd in Tai Po and moved to Tai Wai, where they put up roadblocks and faced off against riot police arriving at the scene. The stalemate lasted until officers fired tear gas at the crowd after repeated warnings were ignored.
Meanwhile, kilometres away at the city's international airport, hundreds of black-clad protesters were staging a sit-in demonstration that was into its second day. By 3.30pm, an estimated 1,000 demonstrators had joined the handful who spent the night in the airport's arrivals hall.
""I came over at 8pm yesterday [Friday] after I finished my research,"" said Hing Siu-fai, a master's student at Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""Everyone is very tired.""
As part of the three-day sit-in, demonstrators covered their eyes or mouths in black cloth, saying they were protesting against Hongkongers being silenced and suppressed, as well as other government moves they considered unreasonable.
Elsewhere, hundreds of police supporters stepped up their campaign to boost officers' morale by expressing their thanks in person - days after Beijing reiterated its confidence in the force amid escalating anti-government pressure.
Members of the Safeguard Hong Kong Alliance, which organised the campaign, and pro-police supporters visited police stations in Central, Kwun Tong and Kwai Chung to show their solidarity with officers. Police stations have become regular targets for protesters.
The alliance's campaign and other pro-police efforts were underscored by an open letter on the front pages of local newspapers calling for an end to the chaos, signed by political and business heavyweights such as Tam Yiu-chung, Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai and Victor Li Tzar-kuoi.
For a few hours, there was a faint hope that Hong Kong might see a return to a normal Saturday - but it was soon shattered as, once again, officers and protesters fought from district to district.

South China Morning Post,2019-09-22,Police obtain protest details from bus firm Court orders KMB to hand over CCTV footage and fare data,771 ,"
Hong Kong police have used court orders to obtain digital fare ­payment details and CCTV ­footage of anti-government protesters from the city's largest bus company, according to sources.
The revelation came yesterday as the city entered its 16th straight weekend of chaotic protests sparked by the government's now-withdrawn extradition bill, with more clashes between radicals throwing petrol bombs and police firing back with tear gas and sponge grenades.
A senior police source said the court orders required KMB to hand over Octopus card transaction records and footage for ­specific bus routes on certain days over the past months.
""The court orders are case-specific. One of the cases involves protesters getting on a KMB double decker on route 42C heading to Lam Tin station on September 3,"" the source said.
That was the night when protesters boarded a bus in Wong Tai Sin on route 42C, heading to Lam Tin MTR station after a rally at Tamar Park. Police entered the bus in Kowloon Bay to check the bags and ID cards of about 20 people.
Another source said KMB had already surrendered the required information, which did not ­include the actual names of the Octopus users, only their card numbers, meaning police would have to seek further details from the card company itself.
The sources said such a move by police was not unprecedented, as they had approached transport operators in the past for such information while investigating crimes.
Thousands joined a short march yesterday afternoon from San Wo Lane Playground in Tuen Mun to the district's government offices.
Having won an appeal to overturn a police ban against the march, organiser Michael Mo Kwan-tai said it was a show of solidarity against official inaction to fix an alleged prostitution problem in Tuen Mun Park.
""Our demand is very local, it's all about Tuen Mun damas, the middle-aged women singing songs in Mandarin using an amplifier and megaphones, in public areas of the park,"" Mo said.
Turning their ire yet again on the city's rail operator, which had earlier announced the closure of Tuen Mun and Yuen Long MTR stations, protesters began trashing facilities at Tuen Mun Light Rail station before spilling onto the surrounding roads, tearing down metal barriers and setting up barricades.
They caused severe traffic disruption as well as light rail route changes and service suspensions.
An easily available and abundant supply of rocks taken from the rail tracks were hurled at ­police from behind the makeshift barriers on Tuen Wui Street and Tuen Mun Heung Sze Wui Road, outside Tuen Mun Town Plaza shopping centre.
There were occasional flashpoints as anti-riot police making arrests became targets for other protesters, with images showing radicals using hiking sticks and umbrellas to assault officers.
The new normal had returned by 5pm as hardcore protesters threw petrol bombs and drew an immediate response of rounds of tear gas from police.
A lull followed as the protesters moved to their next location, Yuen Long MTR station, to mark the two-month anniversary of a violent mob attack on protesters and commuters.
More than 50 shops had closed by 7.30pm in Yoho Mall, which is connected by a bridge to the station, as hundreds of people gathered to sing the movement's de facto anthem, Glory to Hong Kong.
Diehard protesters vandalised the bridge as well as the connected MTR entrance, then blocked roads, starting fires and throwing petrol bombs at police vehicles.
Earlier in the day, pro-Beijing groups took part in a citywide clearance of Lennon Walls, led by outspoken lawmaker Junius Ho Kwan-yiu to ""clean walls and cleanse people's hearts"".
Ho, a hate figure for the protest movement, dialled down his ""Clean Up HK"" campaign atthe last minute, instructingparticipants not to tear down the Lennon Walls, and only to pick up rubbish around them.
There were a few scuffles and arguments, as some volunteers ripped protest Post-it notes off the walls, but no major clashes.
Protesters, who had vowed to fight back if they were attacked, returned later to plaster them with fresh Post-it notes.
The city is facing the prospect of more chaos today, with protesters planning a citywide ""stress test"" targeting the international airport and railway network. Their stated intention is to block road and rail access to the airport starting at noon, in defiance of a court injunction forbidding such radical action.
The MTR announced last night that trains on the Airport Express would not stop at Kowloon, Tsing Yi or AsiaWorld-Expo stations, and downtown check-in services would only be available at Hong Kong station.

South China Morning Post,2019-11-16,"Civil servants warned as uni chiefs urge end to conflict Government tells 180,000 employees they fac",1337 ,"
The Hong Kong government has taken the unprecedented step of warning 180,000 government ­employees they will face ­immediate suspension and other disciplinary action if they are caught taking part in unlawful public activities.
The announcement came as violent protests ground the city to a halt for the fifth straight day, causing widespread disruptions and a rising number of casualties.
The escalating crisis also claimed another high-profile event with organisers announcing the cancellation of Clockenflap - the city's biggest annual music and arts festival - just a week before it was due to be held.
With several campuses occupied by masked protesters, the heads of the nine public universities last night for the first time issued a joint statement, calling on both sides to end the conflict.
Protesters occupying the Chinese University (CUHK) had apparently pulled out last night, but Polytechnic University and the University of Hong Kong ­remained under the control of masked ­radicals.
In a letter to all public servants yesterday, Secretary for the Civil Service Joshua Law Chi-kong said the government had ""zero tolerance"" for any of its employees joining illegal assemblies or breaching the anti-mask law.
""It would be difficult for the community to accept a civil ­servant under arrest being ­allowed to continue to exercise powers and resume functions of office. We will suspend the ­officer's duty in the public interest once an inquiry against him is undertaken,"" Law wrote.
The spiralling unrest once again put the protests, now into their sixth month, under the global spotlight. President Xi Jinping, while attending an annual ­international summit in Brazil on Thursday, took the rare step of commenting on the situation, saying it was the city's most urgent priority to end ­violence and ­restore order.
In a statement yesterday, Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong said Xi's remarks in Brazil were not just the central government's judgment on the city's situation, but also ""substantive requirements"" for the local administration. ""We hope that the executive, legislative and judicial institutions will work together ... so that social order can be restored,"" a spokesman said.
Yang Guang, spokesman for the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, also said his office would be firm in meeting Xi's requirements.
Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung yesterday ­announced he would lead an interdepartmental task force to coordinate government efforts in returning the city to normality.
""We are making sure that ­tackling violence is the number one priority for all departments and bureaus, as President Xi said yesterday,"" Cheung said.
Measures include pooling ­resources from other disciplined services to help the badly stretched police force, and mobilising the Lands, Highways and Food and Environmental Hygiene ­departments to restore ­order. The Education Bureau was tasked with contacting schools and other educational institutions, while the judiciary would explore ways to expedite the ­handling of protest-related cases.
But the move did little to quell the unrest. Shortly after Cheung's press conference in the afternoon, chaos returned to the streets after a relatively peaceful daytime.
The Tolo Highway, which had been partially reopened for nearly eight hours, was again blocked by protesters occupying Chinese University. Live footage showed vehicles stuck on the highway at about 7.30pm.
Protesters blamed Cheung for not returning their earlier ""friendly gesture"" by refusing to pledge that district council elections would ""definitely"" take place on November 24.
In the morning, protesters agreed to partially reopen the highway they blocked, on the ­condition the government ­guaranteed to hold the elections.
The chief secretary merely said ""the government was preparing for the elections"" when asked by reporters. Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Patrick Nip Tak-kuen added that any violent acts would only pose further risks of postponing or even cancelling the election.
At nightfall, some radicals set what was believed to be an empty vehicle on fire on the bridge outside Chinese University, causing at least three explosions. Police also clashed with protesters in Mong Kok.
In the past week, university campuses have emerged as the new battleground between ­radical protesters and police. On Tuesday, riot police battled protesters occupying a bridge above the Tolo Highway, after some threw petrol bombs and other ­objects onto the highway to ­disrupt traffic. The bridge leads to the Chinese University campus.
The campus had since been turned into an ""arsenal"" occupied by protesters, John Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of the force's public relations, said.
Similar developments also happened at the University of Hong Kong, Polytechnic University, City University and Baptist University.
For the first time, the presidents of all nine universities jointly issued a statement to express their frustration. While they condemned the radicals occupying the campuses, the university chiefs also accused the government of an ineffective response.
""The past week has seen a rapid escalation of violence and confrontation throughout Hong Kong. Several universities are now under protesters' control; on-campus hazardous materials have been taken; staff and students have left campus out of fear for their personal safety. These events are challenging our universities in the most fundamental way,"" the joint statement read.
""No political viewpoint gives a licence to damage property, ­employ physical threats, or use violence against individuals ... However, any demand that universities can simply fix the problem is disconnected from reality: these complicated and challenging situations neither originated from the universities, nor can they be resolved through university disciplinary processes,"" they said.
The universities' chiefs asked the government to ""take the lead with swift and concrete action to resolve this political deadlock and restore safety and public order"".
Earlier, both CUHK and PolyU had urged their students and staff to leave campus, which they ­admitted was no longer safe.
In an open letter, Chinese University vice-chancellor Rocky ­Tuan Sung-chi said he believed the majority of the masked protesters who occupied the campus were ""not CUHK students"".
Tuan said these masked radicals ""brought in materials and supplies from outside to assemble a large number of petrol bombs"" and broke into the university laboratories to steal ""highly flammable chemicals, some of which may be turned into explosives, posing serious life threats"".
PolyU president Teng Jin-guang also issued a similar statement to condemn the occupation by ""activists from outside"".
Both universities are strategically located near some of the city's most important transport arteries. The CUHK campus overlooks the Tolo Highway and the East Rail Line that connects the New Territories East to Kowloon, while the PolyU campus in Hung Hom sits next to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel that links Kowloon with Hong Kong Island. It remained blocked by last night.
The violent tactics adopted in this new wave of protests also ­further divided society. Mourners yesterday laid white flowers at the site in Sheung Shui where a 70-year-old cleaner was fatally ­injured by a brick thrown during a clash between protesters and residents on Wednesday.
Elsewhere in the city, while some residents staged demonstrations to support the protesters, many others also became increasingly frustrated and angry.
At Central, where flash mob protests were staged during lunchtime for the past few days, a woman was seen trying to remove the bricks placed on the pavement but was stopped by a group of protesters who told her to leave.
She refused and said she was just trying to help clear the road.
""This has gone too far. [You] should think about the ordinary people?"" she said.

South China Morning Post,2019-07-17,police furious at being castas public enemy Officers say they are sick of society glorifying radical,681 ,"
Anger among frontline police has reached boiling point as the Hong Kong public still sees them as the enemy despite the escalating ­violence with extradition bill protesters leaving more than a dozen officers injured, insiders say.
Plain-clothes police told the Post yesterday that better operational tactics were needed and that extra equipment could not protect them from ""zombie-like"" protesters who acted as though they wanted to ""take officers' lives by any means"".
They were referring to ­violence at New Town Plaza shopping centre in Sha Tin on Sunday, when 13 ­police and 15 demonstrators were injured in vicious clashes after a large rally in the town.
A sergeant lost part of a finger while a constable was kicked off an escalator and brutally assaulted by youths as he fell to the ground. Two officers hit by hard objects believed to be bricks were initially listed in critical condition.
Four officers remained in ­hospital last night.
The worsening violence and increasing desperation in the force sparked a meeting between the four police associations, representing junior officers, inspectors, overseas inspectors and superintendents, and the top brass on Monday. An insider said officers had never been so angry, and it was not down to the frequent verbal assaults they endured but because society glorified the radical protesters and put all the blame on the force.
""It seems everything the protesters do can be justified and forgiven, even when they attack us with rods and bite off one of our fingers. But whatever we do is wrong,"" said the source, who attended Monday's meeting.
""Many Hongkongers have lost their rationality. We, as law ­enforcers, uphold the rule of law but now we cannot even exercise the power given to us by the law.
""What else can we do?""
But he said morale was high.
Another senior officer, speaking about their frustrations, said it appeared the force had become the public enemy during the political fiasco over the now-suspended bill, adding that he dared not tell people he was a police officer.
He said some colleagues had even asked him whether they should declare police as their occupation in their children's school application forms. He was frustrated with the force's tolerant approach to violent protesters during clashes at recent rallies.
""They broke the law in front of us, but we were asked to let the lawbreakers go. Protesters will think we are useless,"" he said. ""They will become brazen and use more violent action next time.""
The management also promised to improve protective gear for plain-clothes officers on the front line, mostly detectives who were there to collect evidence. These detectives, equipped only with a helmet and extendable baton, were often attacked by the mobs.
The Post spoke to two detectives who were deployed to New Town Plaza on Sunday. They both said better protective gear would not help as detectives normally worked in a small group and so were easy targets. What they needed were better tactics and for plain-clothes officers to stick closely with riot police.
""When a few of us are surrounded and assaulted by 30 to 40 protesters with metal rods, ­umbrellas and bricks, better protective gear may just help us buy five more seconds from injury. Don't forget, the protesters grabbed our helmets. They really want to kill us,"" one detective said.
The second detective, whose legs were bruised in clashes, said protesters threw full plastic bottles from a height at his head and beat him up as he was helping people to leave. A cola bottle burst open on his helmet, he said.
""I was like a dartboard. Protesters kept throwing objects at me,"" he said. ""Protesters are like zombies. Any officers acting alone will certainly die in such violent clashes as protesters outnumber us and we are trapped.""
The police personnel wing issued an internal notice last night, saying the force understood injured officers and their families had suffered emotionally and that it would provide every support.
The Hospital Authority promised to give appropriate treatment to injured officers after some complained of impolite staff."
South China Morning Post,2019-09-05,all or nothing for protesters on social media Posts vow fight will go on until five demands are met,664 ,"
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor's announcement that the detested extradition bill, which triggered months of anti-government protests, will be formally withdrawn has left many protesters cold.
Comments posted on social media and statements made by various groups and individuals made it plain it was not enough for the government to give in to only one of the protesters' demands.
LIHKG, the Reddit-like site which has been the de facto virtual command centre of the protest movement, was flooded with messages saying: ""Five key ­demands, not one less.""
Aside from the withdrawal of the bill, the protesters have also demanded an independent probe into the use of force by police; ­amnesty for arrested protesters; a halt to categorising the protests as riots; and the implementation of universal suffrage.
Lam's announcement came after police fired more than 2,350 canisters of tear gas, hundreds of beanbag rounds and sponge ­grenades, the arrests of 1,183 people and a number of ­suicides said to be related to the unrest.
Many went on social media and shared a line from Winter on Fire, a documentary on the 2014 Euromaidan uprising in Ukraine: ""Our friends that we have lost would never forgive us if we ­accepted those terms from the government.""
It was a reminder not to end the protests until all their ­demands are met.
In a statement issued through Telegram - an encrypted messaging app popular with protesters - a group calling itself Guardians of Hong Kong accused the government of buying time to crush the movement by meeting one of the easiest demands. ""Tragedy will repeat itself if the system stays unchanged. We are not giving up after months of protests,"" it said.
The Civil Human Rights Front, the pro-democracy umbrella group which has organised three record-breaking marches, said while Lam had indeed responded to one of its calls, she had ""severely misjudged"" the situation if she thought that was enough.
""The frontline young protesters who hope to defend their home, in the absence of alternatives, have defied the law, been arrested, charged with rioting and seriously assaulted,"" it said in a statement. ""The cold-blooded tyranny has made us more determined to fight for universal ­suffrage and we will keep fighting till all five demands are met.""
Over more than three months, the anti-bill campaign morphed into a citywide movement against the government and police, with escalating use of violence and ­accusations of police brutality.
University student Benjamin Tsang, 21, blamed the government for the alleged police brutality and said: ""It will be extremely unfair to those arrested or injured if the government only addresses one of our demands.""
For Tsang, a turning point ­occurred on the night of July 21, when a mob at Yuen Long MTR station attacked passengers and protesters with rods and sticks. Police were criticised for being slow to arrive at the scene, with some accusing the force of acting in collusion with the thugs, a charge police have denied.
""All this injustice must be ­addressed with investigation by an independent commission of inquiry and prosecution, [or else] we'll never give in,"" he said.
A joint study by academics from Chinese University, Baptist University and Lingnan University found 92.7 per cent of 806 ­respondents who took part in the march held by the Front on ­August 18 felt having an independent probe was ""most important"", while 88.3 per cent felt it was ""most important"" to withdraw the bill completely.
Raymond Mak Ka-chun, ­formerly with the middle-of-the-road think tank Path of Democracy, was among 19 guests invited by Lam to her official residence last week to brainstorm how to initiate a dialogue with those ­behind the protests.
Mak thought the government's decision to withdraw the bill would satisfy some Hongkongers, but added: ""Protesters are mostly emotionally driven by their conflicts with police officers. I'm not sure if the withdrawal alone can achieve the impact the government is looking for."""
South China Morning Post,2019-11-12,Protesters vow that traffic shutdown will be 'new normal',599 ,"
Defiant protesters vowed to keep up the ""new normal"" after yesterday's strategy of widespread traffic disruption brought the city to a partial standstill by forcing shop closures and curtailing the working day for many residents.
Political scientists said the latest actions - though probably unsustainable - had dealt a bigger blow to the city than the usual weekend violence, which Hongkongers had already adapted to as the anti-government unrest entered its sixth month.
In what they dubbed Operation Dawn, the leaderless protesters called on each other to disrupt traffic all over the city in small groups at 7am, to force a citywide strike.
To ensure minimal time for police to plan ahead, they only announced the list of gathering spots an hour in advance, through encrypted messaging channel Telegram, calling on others to block roads once they could form a group of 20.
Their actions paralysed road traffic and forced the closure of more than 20 railway stations throughout the day.
On Reddit-like site LIHKG - thede facto virtual command centre of the movement - users were excited about the disruption they brought and were quick to plan a similar operation for this morning.
""We need to keep up the momentum and turn it into a new habit,"" one of the posts read. ""A business hub will not be able to withstand such attacks on weekdays in the long term.""
Chinese University political scientist Dr Ma Ngok said the Hong Kong government had been wary of any attempts at traffic disruption, as ""they had always wanted to present a business-as-usual picture to the world"".
He cited the Airport Authority's earlier move to secure an injunction order after protesters choked the transport hub, one of the world's busiest.
""But unless the protesters can get civilians to cooperate and support them, such a strategy would hardly be sustainable,"" he said.
Ma believed a significant number of people who took part yesterday were prompted to do so by the police handling of protests in the early morning, when a police sergeant shot a 21-year-old student with a live round in Sai Wan Ho, leaving him in critical condition, and another officer was seen driving through a crowd of protesters on a motorbike.
Protesters have staged similar actions to trigger a de facto citywide strike over the past months.
But the tactics they adopted yesterday were markedly more aggressive and violent.
In contrast to their past actions - for instance slowing railway services by blocking carriage doors or hitting emergency stop buttons - this time they scattered bricks over major thoroughfares, hurled objects onto train tracks and splashed buses with paint.
City University political scientist Edmund Cheng Wai said the protests had entered a new chapter as both the protesters and police had stepped up the use of force.
He said the usual feedback mechanisms through which protesters evaluated a tactic's efficacy and itseffect on public opinion often restrained the violence of frontline activists. But this appeared to be playing a limited role now.
""The police, on the other hand, have also clearly changed their strategy, from crowd control to mass arrests,"" Cheng added.
The latest confrontation came after Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor's meeting with President Xi Jinping, who gave Lam his full support while signalling that her government must quell the unrest.
Lau Siu-kai, vice-president of the semi-official think tank the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said the protesters' moves would only prompt more suppression from the authorities, while costing them support in wider society."
South China Morning Post,2019-06-19,HK events have given Taiwan's leader a boost Cary Huang says support for Hongkongers has propelled T,670 ,"
One of the most unintended consequences of the two massive protests in Hong Kong against the extradition bill is the city's emergence as a bellwether for Taiwan's 2020 presidential election.
Since Taiwan's first direct presidential election in 1996, cross-strait relations have dominated debate on the island, while Hong Kong issues have rarely been mentioned.
However, the three massive protests in the past two weeks are all related to Hong Kong's relations with Beijing. On June 4, 180,000 people attended the annual candlelight vigil in Victoria Park to mark the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. Then, over 1 million people took to the streets on June 9 and nearly 2 million came out again last Sunday to protest against the extradition bill.
These developments may have alarmed people in Taiwan, who have witnessed years of declining freedoms in Hong Kong since the handover on July 1, 1997. Many Taiwanese fear that Hong Kong today will be their tomorrow if they are forced to accept Beijing's terms for reunification.
The millions who marched against the bill reflect widespread distrust of the mainland judicial system and the belief that their freedom and liberties will be further curtailed, despite Beijing's promise otherwise.
Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, who on June 13 won the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) nomination to run for a second four-year term, and all presidential hopefuls have scrambled to show support for Hongkongers. The main opposition Kuomintang will select its presidential nominee in a primary next month.
Meanwhile, thousands also rallied in Taiwan last Sunday to show solidarity with the Hong Kong protesters. And, on Monday, Taiwan's legislature passed a joint statement in support of the protesters.
Analysts said Tsai's rebuff of President Xi Jinping's statement in January on Taiwan adopting ""one country, two systems"" and support for Hongkongers helped propel her through the DPP primary.
The ""one country, two systems"" framework was originally designed for Taiwan by late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, but first applied to Hong Kong. In demonstrations, some Hong Kong protesters carried placards that read, ""'one country, two systems' is a total failure"". Multiple surveys have suggested that the vast majority of Taiwanese oppose the ""one country, two systems"" proposal. The Hong Kong protests have given ammunition to embattled Tsai.
The protests come amid a triangular diplomatic wrangle between the United States, China and Taiwan, with Washington-Taipei relations at a high while Washington-Beijing ties are at a low.
Taiwan and Hong Kong, the two free societies under Beijing's shadow, share much in their democratic aspirations, as both coincidentally began their respective democratic reforms in the mid-1980s.
Over time, Taiwan has become one of the most lively and vibrant free democracies in Asia while democratic reform in Hong Kong has largely stalled since the handover due to deep disagreements between Beijing and Hongkongers.
Taiwan and Hong Kong's shared grievances against Beijing could not have been more evident than in their mass protests in 2014. Taiwan's ""sunflower movement"" opposed a controversial trade pact with China. Hong Kong's ""umbrella movement"" protested against a political reform bill that would effectively allow Beijing to screen candidates standing for ""direct election"" of the chief executive.
Hong Kong and Taiwan are also both ambiguous about their ethnic links with the mainland, as multiple surveys have suggested an increase in the number of people who identify themselves as ""Hongkongers"" or ""Taiwanese"" respectively rather than ""Chinese"".
In the short term, the Hong Kong protests may have helped boost the prospects of Tsai and the DPP at the expense of the Beijing-friendly KMT in the upcoming elections. In the longer term, the protests may help further alienate Taiwan and the mainland, and Taiwanese and mainlanders.

South China Morning Post,2019-11-12,tear gas fired at university campuses amid showdowns Protesters hurl bricks and petrol bombs as offi,749 ,"
Police fired tear gas in tertiary ­institutions yesterday, with ­Chinese University turned into a smoking battlefield where ­student protesters and officers were locked in a tense stand-off for seven hours.
The widespread traffic disruptions in the morning, caused by anti-government protesters ­calling for a citywide strike, also led to 11 universities cancelling classes. Ten will continue to ­suspend classes today.
Police yesterday entered the campuses of Chinese University (CUHK), Polytechnic University (PolyU) and the University of Hong Kong (HKU) to take action against protesters, firing tear gas in the first two.
The confrontation at CUHK in Sha Tin started at 8am, after ­objects were seen thrown onto MTR tracks at a station nearby. Police then entered the campus through a bridge from an ­entrance near Tolo Harbour and set up a defence line there.
Another group of officers, who were clearing barricades on Tai Po Road, fired the first volley of tear gas into the campus at 11am. Dozens of students guarded the entrance along the road, shielding themselves with umbrellas.
Throughout the day, more than 100 rounds of tear gas, sponge grenades and rubber bullets were fired by police, while protesters hurled bricks and ­petrol bombs. At least three ­people were ­arrested in CUHK.
A young male student protester from the university said he was angry with police use of firearms. ""They already shot a few rounds at Sai Wan Ho earlier ­today. When I saw that I cried,"" he said, adding the shooting of a 21-year-old ­protester had brought more people out onto the streets.
A CUHK staff member in his mid-20s, who did not want to be named, said it was outrageous that ­police had entered the ­campus without a warrant.
""Once police are out, there will be ­conflict,"" he said, adding ­protesters were only trying to keep ­officers off the campus.
Towards the end of the stand-off, Democratic Party lawmaker Roy Kwong Chun-yu arrived at the scene, to the cheers of some students.
Police justified their actions at an afternoon press conference. ""Are they CUHK students? I hope not ... They threw petrol bombs and objects at officers. No university campuses should be havens for criminals,"" Chief Superintendent Kelvin Kong Wing-cheung said.
Last month, police sparked controversy by entering the Sha Tin campus, allegedly without the school's consent, in the early hours on a Sunday, tracking down and arresting five students who were putting up protest-related posters. At the time CUHK ­expressed concern and urged ­police to contact university ­management before entering, whenever practicable.
It remained unclear if police had again entered the campus without telling management.
CUHK said last night vice-chancellor Rocky Tuan Sung-chi had contacted the police and urged ­officers to remain calm.
Chaos also erupted at PolyU in Hung Hom, where protesters set plants and rubbish on fire on their campus. The glass panels of the Li Ka Shing Tower were broken, and multiple entrances were blocked with metal barriers and plants.
On a footbridge near the ­campus, protesters threw chairs down onto roads below that led to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel. One person threw a petrol bomb from the bridge onto the road outside PolyU, causing a fire. Police ­responded with tear gas.
In a statement, PolyU expressed ""deep regret"" for the conflicts on its campus. It ­noted that riot police gave chase to protesters suspected of blocking roads. It ""strongly condemned"" the violence and said it ""reserves the right to take appropriate ­actions"".
At HKU in Pok Fu Lam, the MTR station entrance was set on fire at 9.30am. Police fired at least one round of tear gas. Students set up barricades at the gates.
Police said officers entered HKU to try to arrest rioters who had retreated there, and during their operation inside the ­campus, protesters gathered and threw bricks and petrol bombs.
HKU later confirmed in a statement that five of its students were arrested, and that its vice-chancellor had written to the ­police commissioner to ask that the force ensured the rights of those detained.
The university also said it was informed by police that they were responding to 999 calls, one of the exceptions in which officers were allowed on the campus.
The pro-democracy Professional Teachers' Union yesterday called for the government to ­require all kindergartens and ­secondary schools to suspend classes today, but the ­Education Bureau did not ­announce any change of plans.

South China Morning Post,2019-09-05,lam declares WITHDRAWAL of bill Chief executive's dramatic U-turn on legislation that sparked city's,1242 ,"
Embattled Hong Kong leader ­Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor dropped a bombshell yesterday, announcing she would formally withdraw the hated extradition bill that sparked the city's protest crisis, but her dramatic U-turn drew more scepticism than hope for an end to nearly three months of turmoil.
Even though Lam was finally acceding to one of the demonstrators' five demands, protesters and politicians alike argued the concession came too little, too late. Many doubted it would do much to ease roiling tensions fuelled by increasingly violent clashes between protesters and police over the past 13 weeks.
Lam's pro-establishment ­allies were among those leery of the move, fearful that the flip-flopping would affect their own re-election chances in district council polls in November and Legislative Council elections next year.
Barely three hours later, a group calling themselves the ­self-proclaimed representatives of protesters dismissed the ­withdrawal of the bill asapplying ""a band-aid to rotting flesh"".
They maintained that all ""five demands, not one less"" had to be met before they would cease their actions, one representative said at a press conference outside the Legislative Council.
In her stunning announcement, Lam addressed but did not fully acquiesce to another of the protesters' key demand, the ­setting up of an independent commission of inquiry into the use of force by the police. Instead, she said she would invite community leaders, professionals and academics to independently examine the deep-rooted ­problems in the society and ­advise the government on new policies to map the way forward.
""The discontentment extends far beyond the bill,"" a sombre-looking Lam said in a pre-recorded message broadcast on local television just before 6pm.
""It covers political, economic and social issues, including the oft-mentioned problems relating to housing and land supply, ­income distribution, social justice and mobility and opportunities for our young people. It also ­reflects the desire for the public to be fully engaged in government decision-making,"" she said.
In place of the commission, she endorsed fully the work of the Independent Police Complaints Council to look into police actions and made it a point to include the July 21 incident involving the Yuen Long beatings of bystanders by a mob of white-clad thugs where the force was allegedly late to the scene.
To assist the panel, she ­announced two new members: former Bar Association chairman Paul Lam Ting-kwok andex-director of education HelenYu Lai Ching-ping, along with overseas experts.
Lam also pledged she and principal officials in her cabinet would reach out to different communities to start a direct dialogue, and find solutions. ""People from all walks of life, with different stances and backgrounds are invited to share their views and air grievances. We must find ways to address the discontent,"" she said.
The chief executive said she hoped the four actions she outlined would help society move forward, as the ongoing protests had challenged the city's rule of law and Beijing's ""one country, two systems"" governing principle on Hong Kong.
""Let's replace conflicts with conversations, and let's look for solutions,"" she said.
Lam's decision to formally withdraw the bill was first reported exclusively by the Post at2.04pm, causing markets to react positively, with the Hang Seng benchmark index soaring 995 points, or 3.9 per cent, to 26,523 as it closed at 4pm.
In similar vein, business chambers, such as the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and the Chinese Manufacturers' Association, and several pro-government legislators,welcomed the moved which they said would help to calm tensions.
The extradition bill crisis, which has continued for more than 13 weeks after an estimated1 million people took to the streets on June 9, has morphed into anti-government movement.
The bill would have allowed for extradition of fugitives tojurisdictions that the city lacks an arrangement with, including the mainland. Critics had warned the bill effectively removed the legal firewall between the city and the mainland, where fair trials were not guaranteed.
Lam had originally suspended the bill and then declared it to be ""dead"" but refused to withdraw it, even after an estimated 2 million people took to the streets on June 16 and protests continued unabated, often descending into chaos and violence.
The protesters want Lam to formally withdraw the bill which first sparked the crisis, set up a commission of inquiry to investigate police conduct in tackling the protests, grant amnesty to those who have been arrested, stop characterising the protests as riots, and restart the city's stalled political reform process.
Their demonstrations have led to 1,183 people being arrested as of yesterday and some 2,350 rounds of tear gas fired, hundreds of rubber bullets, beanbag rounds and sponge-tipped rounds shotin increasingly violent clashesbetween protesters and police.
Commentators and pro-Beijing politicians yesterdaywere doubtful that Lam's four measures would do much toquell the violence in the city.Pan-democrats and those who support the protesters said unless she addressed all five demands, tensions would not subside.
The camp's convenor Claudia Mo Man-ching said: ""Carrie Lam cannot get away with nebulous measures.""
Democratic Party chairman Wu Chi-wai also described Lam's actions as ""fake concessions"", as a prelude to a tougher stance against protesters.
Protesters on their various Telegram channels argued that public concern had shiftedtowards what they described as the police's ""brutal"", or""excessive"", use of force againstprotesters and ordinary citizens, and Lam had to address these concerns or risk more turmoil.
Lam's announcement came after a weekend in which the city experienced some of the fiercest battles so far, as the force launched a wave of mass arrests on the eve of a banned march, and demonstrators lobbed 100 petrol bombs at assorted targets such as police headquarters and stations and government buildings.
But sources said Lam's decision must not be interpreted as the government giving in to violence, but a way to start dialogue. In her video message, Lam said the government would withdraw the bill when the legislature meetsagain, as required by the rules of procedure.
On the protesters' two other demands, Lam said the government would not back down on them. ""On the matter of the protest being a riot, we have explained that in fact there is no legal effect on how such incidents are described or categorised,"" she said. ""On dropping charges against protesters and rioters and shelving prosecutions. I have explained that this is contrary to the rule of law, and is not acceptable.""
However, Lam did not rule out the protesters' fifth demand for the relaunch of democratic reforms, noting this was provided in the Basic Law. But she said it could only be done ""in an atmosphere that is conducive to mutual trust and understanding, and without further polarising society"".
The Post understands that the Hong Kong government did not seek Beijing's approval before ­deciding to withdraw the bill,although the measures had been communicated to it.
The chief executive's decision came a day before she leaves for Nanning in Guangxi for theannual pan-Pearl River Deltaregional cooperation conference. It will be her first trip outside the city since the protests began.

South China Morning Post,2019-11-15,"Protesters reinforce Sha Tin stronghold Two days after violent clashes, Chinese University's campus",992 ,"
Visitors trying to enter Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), the site of a fiery battle between protesters and police on Tuesday, have encountered a makeshift checkpoint.
Protesters wearing black who guard the booth - made of bamboo sticks, umbrellas and a door from a trashed car - roughly search through visitors' belongings and question the purpose of their visit to the Sha Tin campus.
A plank at the checkpoint has the words ""CU arrival"" scrawled on it.
The protesters claimed their intention was to prevent plain-clothes police officers from getting onto the grounds, but it has resulted in many people, especially university staff, feeling disgruntled and saying they had a right to enter as an employee.
Two days on from fierce clashes that saw an exchange of petrol bombs and tear gas between protesters and police, scorching and scarring the 137-hectare facility overlooking Tolo Harbour, the university has been turned into a stronghold for the activists.
Barricades are no longer made of sticks and projectiles, but strengthened by concrete and bricks. A charging booth for power banks and cellphones has been established.
First aid stations have been set up in the sports centre and fitness room, while the sports field has been converted into a training camp for those intending to hurl petrol bombs to strengthen their throwing arm and improve their aim, using water bottles. It becomes a campsite by night.
A protester was understood to have been injured and sent to hospital on Wednesday night while driving a vehicles they had commandeered on campus.
Protesters have also occupied the unmanned Chung Chi Tang canteen since Tuesday to prepare meals. A menu that originally featured only white rice with sausages, luncheon meat and eggs has expanded its repertoire as more food has been donated by supporters, some of whom have stayed on to cook, wash up and do laundry.
""Yesterday we used stored ingredients in the kitchen, but we are now using meat, vegetables and rice freshly brought by volunteers,"" said a full-time chef volunteering at CUHK, who gave her name as Siu Wai. ""So it's safe to eat, not too salty and freshly made.""
Most of the volunteers in the canteen yesterday had culinary experience, she added.
Similar scenes could be found at other universities in the city.
A ""struggle canteen"" was set up at Polytechnic University and run by dozens of demonstrators, who cooked a variety of meals including barbecued pork and fries which they took outside for their colleagues.
According to interviews conducted by Post reporters, protesters at Chinese University were a mixture of outsiders and students. Some claimed to have been from Education University, Baptist University and other higher education institutions, while others claimed to be secondary school students.
A frontline protester, who did not study in Hong Kong and gave his name as Sky, described defending the campus from police as ""a war"" and said it was different tothe cat-and-mouse games played with the force on the streets.
The landscape of the campus had given them advantages and levelled the playing field, the 23-year old, who was born on the mainland and raised in Hong Kong, said.
""There are 'parents' bringing supplies, such as food, daily necessities and materials to make petrol bombs,"" he said, referring to supporters of the cause.
The frontline protesters have also gained the support of moderate students and graduates, who never imagined they would be assisting or even making petrol bombs.
Indian-born full-time students Kajal, 20, and Shruti, 19, helped passed on water, food, pliers and bottles to the frontline on Tuesday.
""That's the only contribution we can make. This is also our campus,"" Kajal said. ""The police entered the campus without permission or a warrant. I think it's unjust.""
CUHK alumnus Apple Chan, in her 30s, was among hundreds stuffing small towels into bottles on a ""production line"" at a roundabout on Tuesday night.
She was a first-timer and had to be shown how to insert the cloth and which bottle worked best for a petrol bomb.
""I never imagined I would be making petrol bombs,"" she said. ""I was so angry when police walked into CUHK. I could not even work, so I left early and came here.""
But Dr Wilson Wong Wai-ho, associate professor of CUHK's department of government and public administration, described the latest development as ""the worst crisis our university has faced since it was founded in 1963"".
The protesters taking control of the university would increase the risk of police getting tough with those on campus, he said.
He lamented the fact that many alumni had returned to the institution in the hope of defending it. ""Unfortunately, our campushas been hijacked by radical protesters andI am worried something ugly will happen soon,"" Wong said.
CUHK has a track record of leading Hong Kong's student activism.
When the university was maliciously renamed ""rioters' university"" on a Google map in June - when the movement against the now-withdrawn extradition bill first erupted - many of its alumni and students had taken it as a compliment.
The sentiment was still evident as protesters spray-painted the school bus with the phrase on Wednesday.
CUHK political scientist Dr Ma Ngok, also an alumnus of the school, said the university had always stood in stark contrastto its peers.
Ma added what was happening in CUHK was unprecedented in the city's history.
""It was all about making your voice heard on the streets in the past, but now protesters are trying to defend against physical intrusion,"" he said.
Last night, a large but closed-door meeting was held by the demonstrators on whether they should leave the campus and join other protests outside as police had not taken action against them for two days.
The number of people remaining on campus had dropped significantly from the day before.
One female protester said: ""We are worried that once we leave we won't be able to come back.""

South China Morning Post,2019-07-28,Video of protesters at airport jostling elderly man goes viral,308 ,"
A video of a group of young people jostling and swearing at an elderly man during the Hong Kong International Airport sit-in has gone viral online.
The clip showed several youths, believed to be protesters against the city's now-shelved extradition bill, confronting the man who witnesses said had earlier pushed aside a poster held by a young woman protester.
In other videos, the man was seen wheeling his suitcase toward the bus terminal with a yellow note placed on his back reading: ""Black police plus triads equals to no law"".
Flight attendant Zoey Au, who witnessed the early part of the row, said the incident had begun inside the arrivals hall where the protesters were staging a sit-in.
""He rushed towards a girl holding a poster and slapped it,"" Au said. ""After that, he tried to flee. I remember him almost tripping.""
She said the man was chased by a group of protesters and airport staff tried to break up the confrontation.
In the video, the protesters shouted at the man and tried to stop him from leaving, with one demonstrator falling to the ground and others jostling and cornering him against a wall.
""Don't leave, call police,"" protesters shouted in the video as they grabbed the man's jacket.
Another youth intervened and embraced the man in an apparent attempt to calm him and stop the confrontation.
The incident occurred as tens of thousands of protesters staged a sit-in on Friday at one of the airport's arrival halls in a bid to win international support for the campaign to withdraw the bill.
They were also demanding the government set up an independent commission to investigate what protesters said was excessive use of force by police during previous clashes. Many protesters became human ""Lennon Walls"", a reference to displays of messages of support.
Police said they did not have a record of the incident at the airport.

South China Morning Post,2019-06-30,Lee closer to their hearts than Chan,646 ,"
Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan may be Hong Kong's two most famous martial arts sons, but the kung fu superstars are like chalk and cheese to the protesters taking part in historic marches against the city's extradition bill. Enter The Dragon star Lee's famous ""Be water, my friend"" saying has become a clarion call among the young protesters demanding Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor withdraw the unpopular extradition bill.
Lee's words have also inspired a new form of guerilla tactics that have outfoxed the police and given the government headaches, with protesters moving in unexpected waves, rolling from one spot to another. Spontaneous road blockades and the circling of buildings have replaced the prolonged mass sit-ins of the 2014 Occupy movement, creating a ""formless"" protest.
""We are formless, we are shapeless, we can flow, we can crash, we are like water, we are Hongkongers"" read one protester's sign channelling Lee's philosophy. Protesters are also wearing T-shirts and clothing bearing Lee's words and likeness, with the martial arts icon becoming a symbol of the movement.
Drunken Master star Chan, on the other hand, feigned ignorance of the protests when asked during a trip to Taiwan to promote his new album, I Am Jackie Chan. The visit coincided with police firing tear gas in clashes with demonstrators as tens of thousands surrounded the Legislative Council building in Hong Kong.
""I only found out yesterday there was a big march in Hong Kong. I don't know anything about it,"" Chan said, despite images of two million marchers being widely disseminated around the world.
It was a less controversial take than his 2014 comments, when he weighed in on Beijing's side and said he was ""worried"" about damage to Hong Kong's financial markets during the occupation of key commercial districts, and called for a ""return to rationality"".
""I am willing to work hard with everyone ... to face the future, love our country, love our Hong Kong,"" he added.
Well, Chan may love Hong Kong, but does Hong Kong love him any more? Hong Kong was not amused when Chan dined with two music stars earlier this month. Taiwanese megastar Jay Chou and X Japan leader Yoshiki faced an online backlash after sharing pictures on social media of themselves hanging out with the 65-year-old, who is a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The legislative advisory body in Beijing is largely made up of members of the Communist Party.
The Hong Kong-born actor is adored around the world for his famous kung fu films such as the Rush Hour series, but his pro-Beijing views and dismissals of the democracy movement are unlikely to endear him to protesters.
""I'm not sure if it's good to have freedom or not,"" he said in 2009. ""I'm really confused now. If you're too free, you're like the way Hong Kong is now. It's very chaotic. Taiwan is also very chaotic.""
But while Chan is opposed to chaos, Lee embraced it in his teachings. ""In the middle of chaos lies opportunity,"" was one of his famous idioms. ""Out of chaos, find simplicity. From discord, find harmony,"" was another.
Hong Kong's protesters believe they are taking their opportunity amid the chaos to have their voices heard by the world. They say they are trying to bring the city together as one in harmony against China's increasing curbs on their freedoms.
If Lee was alive today, who knows whether he would weigh in on the side of the protesters? Stardom and success often comes with a price to pay for Chinese actors and celebrities. There is of course no way to tell. But Lee's legend is being immortalised by a new generation of Hongkongers who have made him a symbol for their cause. Chan, meanwhile, continues to turn a blind eye to what is going on in his home city. Maybe his PR people have told him it's not a good look to make a big fuss again, something he probably doesn't need telling."
South China Morning Post,2019-10-28,"Violence and vandalism return to streets of Kowloon Rampaging protesters block roads, fight with pol",650 ,"
Hong Kong marked the 21st straight weekend of anti-government protest violenceand chaos as radicals went on arampage that spread from Tsim Sha Tsui to Mong Kok and Sham Shui Po yesterday.
Once again, violent mobs blocked roads, fought with police and hurled petrol bombs at them, vandalised shops, forced the ­closure of MTR stations and ­disrupted train services, while tear gas and water cannon were ­deployed against them. The clashes began in Tsim Sha Tsui in the afternoon as hundreds joined an illegal gathering at Salisbury Garden ­before 3pm to condemn the use of ""chemical weapons"" - tear gas and water cannons.
Tensions escalated as hundreds of officers in riot gear were deployed around the park and outside the Space Museum and Cultural Centre, with some conducting searches on protesters, many of whom wore masks indefiance of an official ban and were heckling police. 
Dozens of officers were also stationed around Chungking Mansions, a social and commercial hub for ethnic minority groups, as well as outsideKowloon Mosque.
A brawl broke out near the Space Museum and police ­pepper-sprayed protesters who attacked them with umbrellas and other objects.
The Peninsula hotel pulled down its shutters as the crowds spilled onto the junction ofSalisbury Road and Nathan Road, paralysing traffic. Police raised a black warning flag before firing tear gas at the rowdy crowd, along with sponge-tipped and rubber bullets at 3.40pm. Several people were arrested.
Many of the protesters moved on to Jordan, Mong Kok and Yau Ma Tei, while more rowdy protests erupted in other parts of Kowloon such as Sham Shui Po, To Kwa Wan and Whampoa.
Police said rioters set fire to shops in Jordan and hurled petrol bombs at Sham Shui Po Police Station and Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices.
One group of police officers was seen retreating into the MTR station in Mong Kok and closing the shutters behind them before firing tear gas at protesters inpursuit, who hurled objects through the metal grill.
The station was shut down as a fire was started at one entrance, and that was followed by theclosure of Yau Ma Tei station.Police said rioters had thrown""smoke grenades"" at MTR ­entrances.
East Rail services to the Lo Wu border were also disrupted as a rubbish bin and other objects were thrown onto the tracks near Hung Hom. Masked radicals vandalised a branch of snack food chain Best Mart 360, which had been boarded up but could not prevent them from breaking in and starting a fire inside.
In Yau Ma Tei, a man wasattacked with hammers as a mob beat him, accusing him of being an undercover officer and leaving him with a bloodied head. Another man, a Mandarin speaker, was set upon in Mong Kok.
After being repeatedlycriticised for concealing their identification numbers, some ­police officers were seen displaying white cards on their uniforms, specifying the acronyms and numbers of the district or unit to which they belonged.
Earlier in Tsim Sha Tsui, more than 20 protesters stood in front of Kowloon Mosque to ""protect"" it, as a water cannon truck and two armoured vehicles made their way down Nathan Road. Police and top government officials had to apologise to Muslim community leaders after the entrance of the mosque was accidentally hit by water cannon a week earlier.
One of them was James Ahamed, a Hongkonger of Sri Lankan descent who has lived in the city for more than 50 years. He attended prayers before sunset at the mosque. ""After four months, we've gotten used to [the protests] now. I stand with Hongkongers,"" he said.
After the water cannon vehicle passed the mosque without incident, it sprayed a clear liquid at protesters near the Holiday Inn hotel on Mody Road, and again in Jordan. A hotel valet said the chemical liquid hit some windows. ""To be honest, it didn't really hit the protesters either, they all ran away. It didn't affect our guests at all,"" he said.> MORE REPORTS A3, C1"
South China Morning Post,2019-06-13,Chief backs officers who are accused by lawmaker of having 'gone crazy',604 ,"
A lawmaker accused police of having ""gone crazy"" when they fired tear gas, rubber bullets and rounds of beanbags at protesters outside the legislature.
But police chief Stephen Lo Wai-chung said there was a ""riot"" situation in Admiralty and officers had to take firm measures when protesters stormed their defensive lines.
Protesters could have used sharpened metal bars as weapons if officers had not used appropriate force to protect themselves, Lo said.
Pan-democrat lawmakers condemned Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and the police for ""clamping down a largely peaceful protest with excessive force"".
Claudia Mo Man-ching, convenor of the pro-democracy bloc, said: ""We severely condemn the police for using excessive force and smearing the mostly peaceful protesters as rioters.""
Lo described the situation in Admiralty as ""chaotic"", saying members of the public should not enter the area.
Soon after 3.30pm, police started to hurl tear gas canisters and fire rounds of tear gas to disperse protesters in Tim Wa Avenue, Tim Mei Avenue, Lung Wo Road and Harcourt Road.
The force also had 38mm-calibre Federal Riot Guns - nicknamed ""big mouth guns"" with an effective range of up to 20 metres - that could fire rubber baton rounds. Other anti-riot equipment being deployed included shotguns that fired beanbag rounds.
Following the 2014 pro-democracy Occupy protests and the 2016 Mong Kok riot, police acquired new equipment, including three anti-riot vehicles fitted with water cannons and powerful jets for dispensing pepper spray. The force also bought 400 tactical suits designed to protect officers from heat-related injuries and missiles.
A law enforcement source said the force had also tested some mid-range crowd control equipment such as new anti-riot rubber bullets, but no purchases were made.
The hi-tech equipment was recommended by an internal subcommittee set up to review police arms, equipment and training in response to the Mong Kok riot, in which more than 100 police were injured.
On Tuesday night, more than 5,000 officers were initially deployed, drawn from all five regional response contingents, set up after the 2014 protests.
More than 100 elite officers from the special tactical squad, known as blue team, were also deployed. Extra forces from all police districts were drafted in yesterday morning.
Democrat Andrew Wan ­­Siu-kin said he and two other lawmakers were sprayed with at least three rounds of pepper solution when they tried to break up clashes between police and protesters, despite repeatedly revealing their identities.
""The government and the police have gone crazy. How much more blood does Carrie Lam want before she can finally agree to call the bill off?"" he said.
Comparing Lam with her predecessor Leung Chun-ying's handling of the Occupy protest, Civic Party lawmaker Jeremy Tam Man-ho said: ""Even Leung didn't dare deploy bullets.""
Tam Yiu-chung, Hong Kong's sole delegate to China's top legislative body, said the police had no choice but to resort to violence to control the situation.
""There are so many protesters,"" he said. ""They set up barricades and provoked police with umbrellas. They are not just holding silent protests. They are agitated.""
Barrister Ronny Tong Ka-wah, a member of the government's Executive Council, said police had no alternative. ""I don't think there is any major issue with the police's handling of the protest,"" he said. ""It is their responsibility to maintain order.""
Referring to images of protesters in helmets, masks and goggles carrying bricks, he said: ""If the protesters had no plan to resort to violence, why they were so well prepared?"""
South China Morning Post,2019-09-23,Taxi drivers join protest ranks by offering free rides Some are moved by the passion of mostly young,737 ,"
They are the invisible taxi drivers who have carried anti-government protesters away from ­police in the midst of countless confrontations.
Some said they started to help because they could not be at the front lines themselves or they felt sympathy with the protesters after watching too much violence on the nightly news.
Others said they put themselves in danger to be like the Korean taxi driver Kim Sa-bok, an unsung hero in the democratisation of South Korea in the 1980s.
Kim risked his life to drive a German journalist around dangerous Gwangju city and helped expose a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy activists. His story was portrayed in the award-winning Korean film A Taxi Driver.
Franco Cheung Ching-ho, 32, said he knew he had to help as soon as protests erupted in June.
""I couldn't go to the front line to join the protests because I couldn't stand the tear gas from the police,"" he said. ""So I decided to use other means to help the movement.""
Cheung has deliberately driven around protest zones with his not-for-hire sign on, offering free rides to black-clad protesters seeking escape routes. He would also buy supplies, such as bottled water, snacks and face masks, and drop them at dispatch points.
He said a conversation he had in July with four young protesters he drove from Causeway Bay to Kowloon Bay made him even more determined to help.
""One of them said he was prepared to face a riot charge if arrested by police. He mentioned it in a light and casual way: 'If 10 years in jail is the worst that could happen to me, I can take it',"" Cheung said.
""I was stunned by their resolve. Those young protesters were all prepared to sacrifice the golden years of their lives for the movement. I swore to them I would do whatever it takes to fight for democracy with them.""
He said of all the free rides he had given, the most dangerous was on September 1 when protesters besieged the airport.
Demonstrators had blocked most access routes, forcing travellers to walk part of the way, crippling train and bus services and prompting a shutdown of the Tung Chung MTR line by trashing the station.
""At around 5pm, I heard that some protesters were trapped in Tung Chung who were trying to walk to the Lantau Link toll plaza to find their way out. I immediately drove to the plaza to pick up some protesters - though I felt very nervous for fear of being stopped by police,"" he said.
When Cheung got to the plaza, he was struck by an unforgettable image - a long line of private cars moving slowly along the roads to take the protesters to the city.
""I was deeply moved by the scene - so many private car owners took a risk to rescue the protesters. It strengthened my conviction that I did the right thing,"" he said.
What pushed 35-year-old taxi driver Andrew Chan to help was watching protesters risk their lives to challenge the authorities. He said a night of free rides cost him about HK$1,000.
""In the past, I cared about making money. But for them, I don't mind earning less. I hope to contribute more because I can't be on the front line,"" he said.
Chan said he felt increasingly nervous because the police crackdown was getting more intense. But one encounter with a young girl had given him courage.
""She was about 16 or 17 and very nervous. Once she got in my taxi, she immediately broke down in tears. I comforted her, but my heart sank heavily. What made a young girl like her so scared and sad? I knew then that I could not turn them away,"" he said.
Jen Chan, 46, a taxi driver for seven years, said he did not look for protesters but would not hesitate to stop if he came across some in danger. He had such an encounter earlier this month.
""It was a Friday night when I drove along Argyle Street near Kowloon City, I saw three black-clad teenagers running in fear. I wanted to help so I stopped, inviting them to get in my taxi,"" he said.
""They were all gasping heavily and horror-stricken, unable to say anything. So I told them I was going to drop them off at a McDonald's in San Po Kong. They left without saying anything.""
But not all support free rides.
Wong Po-keung, chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi Owners' Association, said: ""We are just taxi drivers making a living in Hong Kong. We can't refuse fares, and we'll take whoever hires our service. I did carry some passengers in black, but I didn't know if they were protesters or not.
""It's not our concern and we won't participate in any political movement."""
South China Morning Post,2019-05-16,Six activists found guilty over liaison office 'chaos' Demonstrators were charged with unlawful asse,384 ,"
Six pro-democracy activists were yesterday found guilty of unlawful assembly, obstructing police and incitement charges arising from­a 2016 protest against news of ­Beijing's plan to interpret Hong Kong's mini-constitution.
Facing the bulk of the charges was League of Social Democrats chairman Avery Ng Man-yuen, 42, who announced his intention to appeal after he was convicted of two counts of inciting others to take part in an unlawful assembly.
""We were lawfully trying to host a peaceful protest,"" Ng said. ""It was unreasonable and un­lawful action by ­individual police officers that caused the chaos.""
His case at West Kowloon Court centred on a rally organised by the Civil Human Rights Front on November 6, 2016, during which protesters marched to the central government's liaison ­office in Sheung Wan to protest against the rumoured interpretation of the Basic Law.
Beijing's plan was triggered by the oath-taking antics of two ­lawmakers - Yau Wai-ching and Sixtus Baggio Leung Chung-hang - during their swearing-in ­ceremony on October 12, 2016 at the Legislative Council.
A day after the rally, the ­country's top legislative body ­approved the Basic Law interpretation, requiring all public officials to take their oaths ""sincerely [and] solemnly"" or face disqualification. This eventually resulted in Yau, Leung and four other ­lawmakers losing their seats.
In a 16-day trial held two years later, Ng's defence counsel, ­Douglas Kwok King-hin, complained police had failed in their duty to facilitate the rally for protesters to voice their objections to the liaison office and unlawfullyinfringed on the public's freedom of expression and assembly.
But magistrate Peony Wong Nga-yan yesterday concluded ­police had made reasonable ­arrangements for crowd management and did not obstruct the procession from moving forward.
Ng was found guilty of two incitement charges for calling on others to climb over barriers forming the police cordon and ­acquitted of two alternative counts of a similar nature. Footage played in court showed Ng told protesters: ""We outnumber the police, just simply climb out.""
All the defendants were released on bail until sentencing on September 11. Unlawful assembly is punishable by three years' imprisonment, while obstructing police carries a maximum of two years."

How many universities are there in Hong Kong?
There are 22 higher education institutions that award degrees. Eight are funded by the University Grants Committee: the University of Hong Kong (HKU), Chinese University (CUHK), Hong Kong University of ­Science and Technology (HKUST), Polytechnic University (PolyU), City University, Baptist ­University, Lingnan ­University and the Education University.
Another 13 are self-financing, including the Open University and Shue Yan University. The Academy for Performing Arts, is publicly funded.
HKU, established in 1911, is the city's oldest university. The newest is UOW College, a self-financing institution added to the list of degree-awarding schools from this academic year.
In the closely watched QS World University Rankings, three Hong Kong institutions ranked among the global top 50 in 2019: HKU fared best in 25th place, HKUST was 37th and CUHK was 49th. In the Asian rankings, HKU ranked second, just behind the National University of Singapore, while HKUST was seventh and CUHK ninth.
How many university students are there? More than 100,000 students were enrolled in the eight grants committee-funded universities in the 2018-2019 academic year. Some 86,000 were undergraduates, about 10,800 were in graduate programmes and the rest in subdegree programmes.
Nearly 83,000 were local students. The number of non-local students has risen over the past five years, from 15,151 in 2014-2015 to 18,060 in 2018-2019, ­according to the committee.
Most of the non-local students in 2018-2019 were from the mainland (12,322), followed by 1,479 from South Korea, 731 from Taiwan, 669 from India, 565 from Indonesia and 406 from Malaysia. There were 108 students from the United States and 34 from ­Britain.
The main university entrance examination for ­local students is the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE). Most take four core subjects for the exam - Chinese language, English language, mathematics and liberal studies - and two or three elective ­subjects.
How did campuses become protest flashpoints? The anti-government protests, which began in June, moved to university campuses after Chow Tsz-lok, 22, a second-year computer science student at HKUST, died on November 8. He injured his head after falling from the third floor to the second of a car park in Tseung Kwan O on November 4, while a clash was taking place nearby between protesters and ­police.
The exact circumstances of how Chow fell remain unclear, but protesters accused police of firing tear gas into the area during a dispersal operation and ­obstructing paramedics from reaching him in time. His death prompted protesters to go on the rampage at the HKUST campus, vandalising university president Wei Shyy's residence, and trashing cafeterias, a Starbucks outlet and a Bank of China branch.
Protests then spread to more campuses, and ­escalating clashes on November 11 led to police entering and firing tear gas at CUHK, PolyU and HKU - the first time for such mob dispersal methods to be adopted in tertiary institutions.
Which campuses were worst hit? At HKU in Pok Fu Lam, protesters set fire to the MTR station, built barricades at the campus gates and threw petrol bombs from a footbridge at people ­trying to clear the roads.
Things were worse on the CUHK campus in Sha Tin, which was occupied by radical protesters for four days. During a stand-off around Bridge No 2 near the university, which overlooks the Tolo Highway, a main road in the New Territories, protesters threw petrol bombs, bricks and other objects, and police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds. More than 8,000 petrol bombs were found at CUHK.
The situation has been worse at PolyU in Hung Hom. On November 17, after a day of violent clashes, police locked down the campus, blocking all exits. More than 1,000 masked radicals and their supporters engaged in fierce clashes with police that day. An officer had a calf pierced by an arrow fired from the mob, and an armoured vehicle was set ablaze after being pelted with petrol bombs.
Established in 1937, and ranked fifth among Hong Kong universities and 31st in Asia in 2019 QS rankings, PolyU has been shut down since. Police ­ordered everyone on campus to come out and face arrest, while several protesters tried various methods to escape. About 75 secondary school heads and teachers, as well as political and legal heavyweights, stepped in to help, persuading the majority to leave. But dozens continue to hold out on campus, including radicals who vow to fight to the end.
Is campus activism something new in Hong Kong?
The city's universities are peaceful places of learning most of the time, but they are not new to student ­activism and protests.
During the 2014 Occupy protests, students joined in a class boycott from September 22 to 26, organised by two groups - the Hong Kong Federation of ­Students (HKFS) and Scholarism. Fighting for ­democracy and universal suffrage, students and teachers gathered at the University Mall of CUHK wearing white shirts and yellow ribbons on September 22, when the class boycott officially kicked off.
In 1989, Hong Kong university students ­supported students in Beijing who were protesting for democracy at Tiananmen Square. In May that year, thousands of students took part in a massive demonstration in the city. Hong Kong ­students also raised funds and travelled to Beijing to support the protesters there.
After Beijing's military crackdown in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, HKFS-affiliated students boycotted classes in Hong Kong. University students have been prominent since then at the annual June 4 candlelight vigil in Victoria Park.
Will the protests hurt universities' reputations?The strong anti-mainland aspect of the protests has left students from across the border feeling ­vulnerable. When campuses became flashpoints, they feared for their safety and many decided to leave Hong Kong. A group of mainland students fled the CUHK campus by police boat on November 13.
Zhou, 28, a CUHK doctoral student from the mainland, is still in Hong Kong. Asking to be identified only by his surname, he says he chose to come to Hong Kong because of the city's high academic ­standards, but the campus protests have disrupted his studies and research. Most of his mainland classmates have already gone home.
""Universities should create an environment for students and scholars to ensure that they can ­contribute to society,"" he says. ""The protests have seriously affected our use of libraries and other ­resources. It has hurt the spirit of the universities.""
Educator Tai Hay-lap, a former Education ­Commission member, says universities are the places where human talent is cultivated. Tai says the protests at campuses will make Hong Kong's ­universities less attractive to students and scholars from the mainland and elsewhere.
He expects to see a decline in the number of non-local students in the next academic year.
Tai says Hong Kong's universities have been ­losing their diversity and inclusiveness, with ­xenophobia and cultural conflict springing up on campuses. ""The physical damage will be restored sooner or later, but the cultural divide will take time to recover,"" he says.
But PolyU student Chan, 20, says she sees nothing wrong with protesters taking their cause to ­campuses. She has been occupying the campus and has refused to heed the police call to surrender.
""Universities are places where anyone can voice opinions and people from different places can come,"" says Chan, who asked to be identified only by her surname.
But social sciences major Wong, 25, who also gave only his surname, disagrees. ""They are fighting for their own cause at the expense of people who just want to study in peace,"" the Hongkonger says.
""Universities should be about academics, not ­activism. Not that the two can't coexist, but there are plenty of ways to voice opinions. Being violent is not the behaviour of scholars."""
South China Morning Post,2019-10-09,"HK loses its innocence Four months after the first peaceful protest, the city is a different place -",2384 ,"
All was peaceful when an ­estimated 1 million people took to the streets of Hong Kong on June 9 to protest against an ­extradition bill that would have ­allowed fugitives to be sent to the mainland, among other ­jurisdictions.
They marched for 7½ hours that day, without any incident. No window pane was broken. No bricks were hurled at police officers. No fires were set. No MTR station was trashed.
Today, four months later, that event seems like a distant mem­ory of a very different Hong Kong.
Since then, the city has experienced 18 consecutive weeks of ­increasingly violent protests, nearly all including clashes ­between masked, black-clad crowds and the police.
The more radical among the protesters have blocked roads, set fires, hurled petrol bombs, ­destroyed MTR stations and vandalised restaurants and banks ­regarded as having mainland links.
In separate incidents, protesters stormed the Legislative Council complex, and besieged the Beijing liaison office, pelting it with eggs, defacing the national emblem and spray-painting anti-Beijing expletives on its walls.
Protests have disrupted flights at Hong Kong's international airport, and caused the MTR system to be shut down completely, for the first time in 40 years.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and her government have yet to produce a plan to quell the social unrest and get Hong Kong back to normal.
The protesters made five ­demands: the withdrawal of the extradition bill, an independent inquiry into use of force by the ­police, amnesty for arrested ­protesters, a halt to describing the protests as riots, and the implementation of universal suffrage in Hong Kong.
Lam went so far as to suspend the unpopular bill, but it took three months before she finally gave in and announced that it would be formally withdrawn. Protesters responded with a new rallying call: ""Five demands, not one less.""
The police yesterday said 2,363 people had been arrested since June 9, with about half over the past month alone. Those arrested include 77 who disregarded the law banning masks, which came into force on Saturday.
With no end to the worsening violence, observers have come round to saying that Hong Kong is now experiencing a new normal of social unrest that is not about to end any time soon.
A source close to the Hong Kong government said Beijing was unwilling to make concessions to the protesters' remaining demands, particularly their call for political reform.
""Violence and skirmishes ­between the police and protesters will continue and escalate possibly until the first half of next year,"" the source said.
""Like it or not, this could become the 'new normal'. Society, and even Beijing, may get used to this if things are confined to 'weekends rituals' and do not go really out of control.
The Hong Kong government and police will not hesitate to ­arrest more protesters to scare off the outer layers of the anti-government movement.""
The source said the only realistic hope was the government would be forced to set up a commission of inquiry after the Independent Police Complaints Council presented its report on the police action since June. It is due to be released in January.
For Beijing, the siege of its liaison office in the city on July 21 marked a turning point on how it viewed the protests. At the end of a peaceful march organised by the Civil Human Rights Front, radical protesters defaced the national emblem and spray painted anti-Beijing expletives on the wall.
At the very start of the anti-government protests in June, Wang Zhimin, director of the liaison office, noted that most Hong Kong residents expressed their aspirations through peaceful and rational means and said this showed how civilised the city was.
All that has changed too.
Beijing has stressed that ending the chaos and violence was the top priority and was leaving it to Lam's embattled government to restore law and order. Its patience was also being tested, it indicated in its statement last week, when it said ""the current chaotic situation ... cannot continue indefinitely"".
A mainland expert familiar with Hong Kong affairs warned that small but persistent signs of separatism among some young protesters were red flags.
""Hong Kong people must ­recognise the severity when many young people chant slogans like 'Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times',"" said the expert, who declined to be named. ""Such slogans are unacceptable to the central government. If you look at the history of Tibet and Xinjiang, it is impossible to break Hong Kong away from the mainland.""
Lam yesterday said that, aside from last weekend's ban on masks which provoked more protests, she had no immediate plans for more legislation or to invoke emergency powers.
But a source familiar with the government's position said: ""All options are on the table when the government ponders possible measures to curb violence.""
The source declined to comment on the possibility that emergency laws might be invoked to extend the 48-hour period of detention before an arrested ­person is charged.
The emergency laws give the chief executive the authority to ""make any regulations whatsoever which he [or she] may ­consider desirable in the public interest"" if she considers it an occasion of ""emergency or public danger"".
The powers extend to the appropriation of property, censorship of media, arrests, detentions and deportations, and the power to enter and search premises.
Ivan Choy Chi-keung, a ­political scientist at Chinese University, said the Hong Kong government appeared clueless as it did not seem to know whether to take a tough or moderate stance.
He felt Lam's plan to speak directly with Hongkongers to find a way to end the unrest was now in disarray. ""Carrie Lam introduced the anti-mask law eight days after organising the community dialogue on September 26. I think it's nearly impossible to launch ­another round of dialogue as the tension escalates,"" he said.
While Lam's government appears unable to get a grip on solving the crisis, the same, ironically, could be said of the protesters on how to soldier on with their cause.
The level of violence they have employed has escalated to such an extent that ordinary Hongkongers now shrug off earlier events such as the storming of the Legislative Council building on July 1 as minor compared to the destruction seen in recent weeks.
Intriguingly, there appears to be have been some self-reflection within the seemingly leaderless movement. Hours after mobs trashed MTR stations and vandalised shops and banks with mainland links on Friday night in response to the anti-mask law, several posts popped up on the protesters' virtual command ­centre, the reddit-like site LIHKG, questioning the wisdom of such moves.
Someone soon offered new ""guidelines"", reminding protesters to trash only businesses run by gangsters, as well as government offices and offices of pro-Beijing politicians.
Shops and restaurants owned by Beijing-friendly businessmen should only be ""decorated"" with graffiti and ""Lennon Walls"" of colourful sticky notes bearing anti-government and pro-democracy messages.
""We are largely fighting for ­democracy and freedom, but what we are doing now appears to be attacking those who are not with us,"" a user wrote on LIHKG.
Another said: ""Only dictators would be intolerant of dissenting views. What's the difference between the Communist Party and us, if we 'renovate' the stores just because their owners have a different point of view?""
Others called for the violence to be reduced, in order to retain international support, particularly from the United States.
But others heaped scorn on such advice.
""It's not a matter of having ­different political views now, but ...those who are still supporting the police force are no longer ­human,"" one said.
The notion of seeing the other side as less than human underscores how far the movement has strayed from its peaceful origins on June 9, when the main aim was to block the extradition bill.
The protesters are becoming aware though, that ordinary Hongkongers are affected by the trashing of MTR stations, ATMs, bank fronts and shops, the closure of supermarkets and convenience stores, and the disruption to daily life.
Political scientists monitoring the protesters say there is a ­dynamic ""collective restraint mechanism"" within the movement, and that the radicals pull back each time they realise they have gone too far.
""It is clear that the mechanism has been weakened,"" said Lingnan University academic Samson Yuen Wai-hei, who has been ­doing field work during the ­protests.
""With the police force ­escalating its use of force and the government invoking emergency powers to implement the mask ban, it has become difficult for those peaceful demonstrators to restrain their peers.""
Yuen warned that the protesters' new attitude of taking the law into their own hands could prove fatal to the movement if someone gets killed by such vigilantism. Last Sunday, for example, the ­police hit out at brutal attacks on ordinary citizens after three cases of bloody fist fights.
""They are walking a very fine line,"" Yuen said. ""If someone dies, it will be impossible for peaceful protesters to advise their ­- ­comrades in a friendly way - they will have to condemn them as they won't want the movement to be associated with the incident.""
But Chinese University political scientist Ma Ngok noted that protesters scaled down their ­actions on Monday, partly ­because frontline radicals had been arrested and others were ­reflecting on what they had done.
""One of the characteristics of this movement is that no one knows what types of protest will work and they keep coming up with different ideas, such as singing songs and forming human chains,"" he said.
But he felt the movement has suffered a setback, noting the smaller crowds of protesters over the weekend.
""Fewer people are now taking to the streets with their family members due to intimidation, as it has become a more dangerous activity,"" he said.
The police force has banned most mass marches and rallies since late July and warned that anyone participating would be breaking the law. So there was a higher chance of protesters being arrested, Ma said.
But Yuen expects that the movement will keep up its ­momentum, as people remain unhappy with the police force's handling of protests.
He conceded however that ­recent developments have ""made it difficult for supporters to back up the protesters confidently and righteously"".
A 17-year-old student surnamed Yeung, who has been at the front line of the protests, said she feared that moderate supporters would distance themselves from the movement following the latest incidents of vandalism.
But she remained confident of broad support from the public. ""I believe people will understand if we explain the reasons for our ­actions in our publicity materials, and show why the government should be blamed for all these inconveniences.""
The police force has struggled to keep up with containing the protesters, often appearing to be losing the battle. There has also been an unrelenting campaign to portray the police as evil.
Unable to cope with protesters who engage in urban guerilla ­warfare, move from district to ­district to create chaos and attack officers in their buildings or on the streets, the police have found themselves stretched to the limit. Since the end of last month, some protesters have raised what they call the sixth demand - the ­disbandment of the Hong Kong police force.
Stephen Chiu Wing-kai, chair professor of sociology at the ­Education University, said it was unfortunate that the police had been used by the government to tackle political and governance issues.
""The image of the force has been improving since the 1970s but I can't see the tension between it and a substantial number of residents being eased in the near future. It could take at least several years to mend fences.""
A senior police officer at ­management level stressed it was the force's mission to safeguard law and order, and blamed online rumours and biased news reports for distorting its image.
""What have Hong Kong police done in the past four months, that other advanced countries' police forces would not do when dealing with a riot, for example, the 2011 London riots and the 2018 yellow vests movement in France,"" the insider said.
He called on people to compare the reported fatalities and injuries in those riots with the Hong Kong situation.
""What standards are these people referring to, when judging that police were using excessive force and abusing power? They cannot compare the way we ­handled a riot with a normal street crime.""
He pointed out that many ­netizens had been spreading online rumours and news to smear the force, but not many people or media had condemned the ­protesters' violence. That, in turn, resulted in more violence, as ­rioters believed their behaviour was widely condoned.
The police source added that relations with the public might be in tatters, it was more urgent for the force to restore law and order as ""people are taking the law into their own hands"".
""Even though our staff work up to 16 hours a day, seven days a week and are being sworn at every day, every officer is trying his ­utmost best to safeguard the city and maintain the force's reputation as 'Asia's finest',"" he said.
While he declined to comment on the tactics used by police against protesters, he said members of the public could be doing more to help the police. He said many onlookers often challenged police or jeered at the officers when they were making arrests or conducting searches.
""If the citizens don't do it any more, the officers can concentrate on dealing with the rioters,"" he said.
He said the force was confident about handling any unrest, and had been working to show the world that the accusations against it were unfounded.
Another senior officer told international media last month that the force had been pushed to the limit by the ongoing political crisis.
""If it escalates any more, we will be eating into other areas of policing,"" he warned.
Four months on, none of the three key players - neither the ­government, nor the protesters nor the police - have any the wiser on when and how it will all end. What is evident though is all sides are running ragged. And the Hong Kong of four months ago seemed a more innocent time."
South China Morning Post,2019-07-14,police clear streets after protest erupts in violence At least five officers injured during running,709 ,"
Hong Kong's border town of Sheung Shui was rocked by protest violence and chaos for hours yesterday before police could clear the streets at night, following a major rally against mainland visitors and parallel traders.
Police described the mostly young protesters as ""highly organised"" and well prepared to attack them with iron poles and other weapons which they ­distributed among themselves in advance.
Sources said at least five officers were injured in running battles with hundreds of protesters around the railway station in the afternoon, and there were reports of journalists on the scene being injured.
The trouble broke out after thousands attended the gathering against parallel trading, complaining that the illegal business of goods bought in Hong Kong being smuggled across the border to Shenzhen to be sold for a profit was ruining Sheung Shui.
Clashes began shortly before 6pm when a bridge connecting the Landmark North shopping centre with the MTR station ­became jammed with people and tempers flared.
Two groups of police officers found themselves surrounded by a large crowd of protesters.
As police vehicles brought in reinforcements to San Wan Road where much of the violence was seen, protesters set up barricades using water barriers and metal fencing. At one point protesters surrounded four officers and attacked them with umbrellas and metal poles.
Protesters were beaten with batons and pepper sprayed but they outnumbered police, using umbrellas to defend as well as attack.
Dozens of officers retreated into the North District Town Hall.
The protesters dispersed when riot police moved in, but then regrouped to start targeting shops around them.
Although most stores had closed in advance to avoid trouble, the protesters spent more than an hour blocking off shop fronts with metal railings.
On Lung Sum Avenue, two outlets of Lung Fung Dispensary, the dominant chain in Shek Wu Hui, Sheung Shui, became the first targets.
Senior Superintendent Kong Wing-cheung from the Police Public Relations Branch warned at 7.45pm that officers would soon clear the area as the situation was chaotic and dangerous. He urged locals to stay at home and called on protesters to disperse.
""Protesters collected a large number of metal poles and other weapons and destroyed nearby railings. They also used water barricades, fences and other objects to block roads,"" Kong said.
""We condemn protesters for proactively attacking police officers. Some even attacked us with metal poles and threw an ­unknown powder, hurting us and reporters.""
When riot police moved in shortly after 8pm to clear the streets, the protesters had already dispersed.
The government issued a statement late at night condemning the protesters involved in the violence while acknowledging that most of the participants in the main rally had been peaceful.
""The government respects members of public expressing views in a peaceful and orderly manner. This shows the preciousness of freedom of speech and the quality of Hongkongers,"" the statement read. ""But a small portion of protesters always charge violently and cause damage. The government believes that most Hong Kong people do not approve such illegal behaviour.""
About 150 officers had been deployed for the march and another 700 riot police were on standby.
The march had set off at about 3.30pm from North District Sports Ground, passing along eight streets. Each time marchers passed by a Lung Fung pharmacy, they slowed down and shouted: ""Close down!""
""Reclaim Sheung Shui! Add oil, Hongkongers!"" they chanted.
Other protesters took the opportunity to attack pro-establishment district councillors, chanting ""Shame on DAB [Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong]!""
Leung Kam-shing, convenor of North District Parallel Imports Concern Group, which organised the march, put turnout at 30,000. Police said it peaked at 4,000.
""The first 'reclaim Sheung Shui' march took place in 2012. Seven years on, we are still marching for it,"" Leung said. ""What has the government done other than paying lip service, saying it will listen to the people? People will march again if the government continues to turn a blind eye.""
He called on protesters to support another demonstration in Sha Tin today.

South China Morning Post,2019-09-17,Live-fire warning as police force praised Commissioner commends bravery while union threatens petrol,727 ,"
Hong Kong's police chief commended his officers yesterday for their bravery over the past 100 days of protest crisis as the force's biggest association warned that members could fire live rounds at radicals who attacked them with petrol bombs.
The warning by the Junior ­Police Officers' Association came after more than 10 black-clad ­protesters hurled at least three firebombs at two traffic policemen in Wan Chai on Sunday.
The officers drew their revolvers in response, the fourth time police had done so since protests broke out in early June, sparked by the now-shelved extradition bill.
The latest skirmish took place under the Marsh Road Flyover in Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, at about 5.45pm, when a superintendent and a constable were escorting police vehicles.
Sunday began with an illegal but peaceful march that descended into violence as the city marked the 15th weekend of consecutive protests. Demonstrations have morphed into a wider anti-government movement seeking ­universal suffrage and anindependent probe into police ­actions, among other demands.
Protesters have resorted to more radical methods, such as vandalising railway stations and increasingly throwing petrol bombs, including 80 on Sunday, according to police.
In response, police have fired at least 2,414 rounds of tear gas, according to a Post tally, along with more than 500 rubber bullets and at least 59 beanbag rounds.
Moody's yesterday downgraded its outlook on Hong Kong from stable to negative, warning of the risk of erosion in thecity's institutional strengths, but maintained its sovereign credit rating, unlike Fitch Ratings which took it down a notch.
The force condemned Sunday's violence.
""At least three petrol bombs were thrown at them, whichis ­effectively life-threatening,""police publicity head John Tse Chun-chung said. ""So the officers pulled out their revolvers, and the move was required and needed.""
The incident happened about 45 minutes after a 49-year-old man was reportedly beaten unconscious by protesters in Wan Chai. He was listed as critical in hospital before improving to ­serious.
The two attacks happened after protesters defied a police ban and marched to Central. It descended into violence in various parts of Hong Kong Island. Officers fired 32 rounds of tear gas, 11 rubber bullets and 12 sponge-tipped rounds.
The Junior Police Officers' ­Association, which represents 80 per cent of the 31,000-strong force, condemned the violence.
""I must remind those irrational rioters that the petrol bombs they used are lethal weapons,"" the association's chairman, Lam Chi-wai, said in a statement yesterday.
""When rioters raise a petrol bomb to throw it, officers are likely to treat this as a life-threatening attack ... and resort to the use of commensurate force and weapons to stop them, including firearms with live ammunition.""
It said that according to guidelines on the use of force, officers could use a higher level of force than that of their adversaries.
Pressure group Civil Rights Observer warned that Lam'sremarks could create confusion among frontline officers, urging both the force and protesters to exercise restraint.
""Police can only use [weapons] when their own or the lives of others are under imminent threat that cannot be handled by a lower level of force, while any wrongful or unlawful use of force could attract criminal liability,"" it said.
Meanwhile, Commissioner of Police Stephen Lo Wai-chung issued a message to officers saying that ""looking back, we together have experienced the most unforgettable 100 days in our police ­careers, and I believe the past 100 days should be well remembered in the force's history"".
He added that ""all these lawless and selfish acts"" had seriously ruined the rule of law and plunged Hong Kong into chaos.
Police actions in two other locations on Sunday provoked criticism that they were slow to act.
Confrontations between protesters and rival groups rocked Fortress Hill and North Point. At least two locals allegedly involved in rows with protesters needed hospital treatment.
Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting said: ""Officers should intervene immediately when scuffles happen and arrest attackers, by using the samestandard on young protesters.""
The Hong Kong Journalists ­Association condemned police for not stopping or arresting those who attacked journalists.

South China Morning Post,2019-08-15,How scenes of shocking violence overtook airport Anti-government protests reached another turning po,1315 ,"
Winfred Leung, 18, arrived at Hong Kong International Airport on Tuesday at 9.30pm after ­finishing at his summer job in a ­logistics firm.
Just inside the doors of the ­departure hall, the student, who is starting university in September, found a crowd of people surrounding a man they accused of being a mainland police officer.
Later, after 11pm, he and other protesters identified a second man they felt was acting suspiciously. He had a fluorescent vest of the sort worn by the press and was speaking English with a Mandarin accent.
""We politely asked him what media organisation he was working with but he wouldn't tell us,"" Leung said. ""A few became emotional and tied him up.""
The protesters grew outraged when, having searched his bag, they found a light blue T-shirt bearing the words ""I love HK ­police"" and documents showing he was from Tianjin and worked in the media. They searched for him online and believed he was working for Chinese state tabloid Global Times.
They started beating him, with the man heard in a recording of the incident asking them to go ahead and hit him.
Leung said he stepped back from the scuffle and tried to ask the others to stop beating him but to no avail. ""I don't want to beat people up, just like we hate policemen beating us up,"" he said.
In each case, after repeated heckling, the protesters bound the two mainlanders' hands, beat them and then tried to prevent paramedics from attending to them. The scenes were carried live on television as the protest movement reached another shocking turning point in the level of violence being resorted to.
Leung was one of the thousands of protesters who had taken part in a peaceful demonstration at the airport - one of the world's busiest transport hubs - last week, a protest that would descend into violence late on Tuesday.
After occupying the airport for five days, the protesters crippled operations and caused flights to be cancelled on Monday afternoon. On Tuesday, they showed up again and blockaded departing travellers, causing tempers to fray, as various people who needed to fly remonstrated with them. They included a woman with a heart condition.
Leung said that while was opposed to such actions, including the tying up of the two mainland men, he would not break with his fellow protesters.
The serious disruption to the city's air traffic followed demonstrators escalating their action by swamping the departure hall and boarding areas on Monday, rather than staying in the arrival hall as on previous days.
The late-night chaos was triggered by the protesters' detaining a young man they accused of being an undercover agent from the mainland at the check-in area in the departures hall.
They first surrounded the man at 7pm at terminal one after finding wooden sticks connected with a metal chain on him and started hurling abuse at him. They searched his belongings and found his ID card and travel documents, which they claimed matched the name of an officer from Futian police station in Shenzhen.
He was later led away by Airport Authority staff, but ran into another group of protesters at 9pm and a heated argument ensued. He was seen later surrounded by protesters, his hands bound with cable ties. The protesters would not let paramedics take him away after he lost consciousness at about 10pm. There then ensued a long stand-off as paramedics and a group of police negotiators, dispatched to the airport for the first time since the protests began there, tried to persuade the protesters to let him receive treatment.
It was another hour before he could be ferried onto a waiting ambulance, but there was more trouble outside the terminal as protesters turned on police who were there to help the ambulance leave. Police vehicles were attacked and windows smashed.
A small contingent of fully equipped riot police and elite officers from the Special Tactical Squad fought off the protesters, using pepper spray and batons.
Police then chased protesters into the terminal. As they clashed, protesters took a baton from an officer who had pushed a young woman to the ground and began beating him with it. Cornered, the policeman drew his gun, sending protesters fleeing.
Police also deployed pepper spray, at least twice outside the terminal and once inside.
At about 11.45pm, protesters then turned on the Global Times journalist, beating him and tying him to a luggage trolley. The light-blue T-shirt in his bag was similar to those worn by pro-establishment supporters at police station demonstrations on August 10.
The man was held for just over half an hour before being taken to hospital, but not before he was kicked from the trolley and had projectiles thrown at him while he was on a stretcher.
Five protesters were arrested, charged with unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapons, assaulting the police and breach of the peace.
Scores of travellers were driven to tears and anger as protesters denied them passage to departure gates.
Carol and Samuel Wong, flying home to Melbourne with their child, had their boarding passes torn up by airline staff as the Airport Authority announced the suspension of check-in while they were being processed.
Carol Wong said she understood the protesters' cause, but added: ""Passengers have different reasons. What if they miss the chance to say farewell to a dying loved one because of this?""
A group of five flying to Australia, including two elderly people in wheelchairs, were prevented by protesters from reaching the gate despite appeals by Australian consular staff. One of the group, Helina Marshall, broke into tears of frustration. ""We have got an old lady here, 84 years old and she has heart problems. So they can't let her through to go back home?"" Marshall said.
The Hong Kong police condemned the ""radical and violent acts"" at the airport.
Pan-democratic lawmaker Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung, who was at the scene when protesters surrounded the Global Times reporter, said the actions of protesters were just too much and he disagreed with them.
""What happened at the airport yesterday was going beyond that [peace]. I guess because the violence employed by the police on August 11 was so horrible, yesterday there was [a sentiment] of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,"" he said.
Cheung Shu-wang, chairman of the Staffs and Workers Union of Hong Kong Civil Airlines, slammed the Airport Authority's ""inadequate response"". ""The Authority knew in advance about the protests, but still did not send enough staff to maintain order or request assistance from police. They have a lot of questions to answer about last night's violence,"" he said.
A source close to the authority's management said: ""This is the worst crisis to have hit the airport in its history ... The airport did not expect the protests to escalate this far.""
Lau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of The Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, a semi-official think tank, said the protesters' actions risked losing support from members of the public who abhorred violence.
""Some radical protesters have hijacked the movement, and may reduce public support for the peaceful protesters too, as they won't cut ties and distance themselves from the more extreme group,"" said Lau, adding the central government would be under greater pressure to take an even more hardline stance against the city's protesters after an outpouring of support over the border for the two assaulted mainland men.
Mak Chin-ho, assistant commissioner of police in charge of operations, said of the officer who drew his gun: ""A group of enraged protesters cornered and assaulted him. They took away his baton and pepper spray. His life was seriously threatened and thus could only draw his gun and protect himself.
""My colleague's decision was absolutely right, totally legal and reasonable. His action was heroic, decisive and restrained.""

South China Morning Post,2019-07-20,taiPEI struggles to cope with refuge seekers Taipei struggles to cope with influx of refuge seekers,825 ,"
Taiwan is struggling to handlethe sudden arrival of dozens of ­extradition bill protesters from Hong Kong who want to seek ­refuge on the self-ruled island.
Although members of Taiwanese civil society have already ­offered safe houses for the new ­arrivals, their status remains unclear since the protesters have not yet been charged with criminal offences in Hong Kong and verifying their claims to have taken part in the mass protests will be tricky.
Legal analysts also warned that the situation would be further complicated by Taiwan's lack of clear and specific laws on handling asylum and refugee claims.
Although President Tsai Ing-wen said on Thursday that ­Taiwan would ""handle their cases in appropriate ways"" and on ­""humanitarian grounds"", the ­government has yet to indicate if it would offer refuge to protesters.
According to Taiwanese ­activists who are assisting the new arrivals, between a dozen and 60 protesters have arrived from Hong Kong since early July, most of whom are staying in hostels with the aid of local civic bodies.
Activists argue that Taiwan ­urgently needs to speed up its ­legislative process for handling refugees and asylum seekers as the island has seen an increasing number of applicants from places such as the mainland, Southeast Asia and the Middle East in recent years.
However, they said the arrivals from Hong Kong were a surprise and questioned whether the ­Taiwanese public would welcome them. ""Would the Taiwan public accept their vandalising of the legislature in Hong Kong as an act of non-violence?"" asked Bei Ling, a researcher from the National Chung Cheng University in ­Taipei. ""Would they be seen as democracy activists who are fighting for political freedom?
""I think such a consensus may not even be shared among the politicians in Taiwan,"" Bei said, pointing out that the protesters from Hong Kong - many of whom wore masks during the July 1 ­protests - could not be compared with the local activists who ­campaigned for greater democracy without concealing their identity during Taiwan's Sunflower movement in 2014.
Bei said the protesters' case was also weakened because they would need to prove they would face political persecution if they returned to Hong Kong, but they have not been charged and were able to leave the city legally.
Under Taiwanese law, the ­government is obliged to offer the ""necessary assistance ... [to] Hong Kong or Macau residents whose safety and liberty face ­immediate threats for political reasons"".
But Tseng Chien-yuan, ­chairman of the New School for Democracy and a consultant to the Taipei city government, said there were other options available for the Hong Kong protesters who wanted to stay in Taiwan.
""The Hongkongers can stay in Taiwan by extending their tourist visas as a temporary solution or they can apply for longer-term options such as work or study visas before they can apply for ­residency,"" Tseng said.
""They can extend their one-month tourist visas upon expiry on political grounds, although Taiwan doesn't have a system to handle asylum applications.
""One can apply for residency [in Taiwan] with an investment of no less than NT$6 million [HK$2.26 million], get a job that pays no less than NT$50,000 a month or get a student visa by ­enrolling with a local university. They can then apply for residency if they work for two years in ­Taiwan after graduation.""
The island, which Beijing ­insists is part of China, is not a party to the United Nations ­Refugee Convention - which outlines the rights of those who are granted asylum and the responsibilities of nations granting asylum - and does not have its own ­legislation on refugees.
Chiu E-ling, secretary general of the Taiwan Association for ­Human Rights, called on the ­Taiwanese government to speed up legislation to process refugees and offer protection to asylum seekers because of the rising number of claims.
Katherine Tseng Hui-yi, from the East Asian Institute of the ­National University of Singapore, said the fate of the protesters could become a political issue that may influence Taiwan's presidential elections in January.
""Tsai Ing-wen can claim credit from these cases,"" she said.
However, Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the foreign ministry in Beijing, ridiculed the independence-leaning president, using a slang term for someone standing on shaky ground.
""Save your false compassion [for Hong Kong people],"" said Geng yesterday when asked about Tsai's comments. ""You are ­nothing but a clay idol crossing the river.""
Separately, Hong Kong lawmaker Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, said the relationship between the city and Taiwan would suffer if Taipei offered refuge to the protesters and the island would be seen as a ""haven"" for lawbreakers. ""It could affect our law enforcement agencies' future communication and cooperation with Taiwan police,"" she said.

South China Morning Post,2019-07-16,"rights groups alarmed at violence Injuries mount on both sides, with sergeant's finger partly bitten",548 ,"
Human rights activists yesterday expressed concern at the injuries suffered by protesters and police in Sha Tin on Sunday, claiming that both sides had increased their levels of violence.
The confrontation left 28 people injured, including 13 officers, one of whom had part of his finger bitten off. Video footage and ­photographs showed protesters bleeding from head wounds and one having his wrist bent back by police after being subdued.
Icarus Wong Ho-yin, of Civil Rights Observer, said the situation was worrying. ""Injuries to both protesters and the police have ­become more serious,"" he said.
Law Yuk-kai, director of the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor who was at the protest, said the two sides were hostile to each ­other. He urged the force to adopt a softer approach in future protests to avoid further bloodshed.
The protest in Sha Tin started as a peaceful march that organisers said drew an estimated 115,000 people. Minor scuffles broke out after the march ended, but the situation intensified after 9pm, when police tried to clear protesters from the streets.
Protesters retreated to New Town Plaza, a mall linked to Sha Tin MTR station, where they faced off with police in riot gear.
The Hospital Authority said 28 people sought help from emergency rooms at public hospitals, with 18 having to be admitted.
Last night, seven remained in Prince of Wales Hospital, Sha Tin, and Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital in Tai Po. One was in serious condition and the rest were stable.
A police source said Chief Superintendent Wong Wai, head of the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau, was among the 13 injured officers. A detective hit on the head suffered a fractured skull, while a constable was knocked out by an unknown object in the shopping centre but regained consciousness in hospital.
The source said a sergeant had part of his right ring finger bitten off by a protester. Another source said the sergeant had surgery and was in stable condition yesterday, but did not explain how the incident happened.
Photos taken during the clash showed the sergeant in a group of officers apprehending a male protester at 9.54pm.
According to the University of Hong Kong students union publication, Undergrad, the male protester was an alumnus of the university and was gouged in the eye before he was arrested.
Another officer, wearing a helmet and armed with a shield and baton, was seen dashing into a crowd of protesters at 9.53pm.
News footage showed the officer on an escalator when he was kicked from behind and tumbled down the stairs. About 10 protesters then surrounded him, kicking and beating him with umbrellas until they were stopped by Council Front lawmaker Eddie Chu Hoi-dick and a video journalist.
Pro-democracy group Demosisto said one of its members had his wrist ""bent 180 degrees"" by ­police. News footage showed Chu Yan-ho being subdued on the ground outside the bus terminus under New Town Plaza at around 9.45pm.
A police officer was then seen bending the protester's wrist.
Ivan Lam Long-yin, chairman of Demosisto, said it was unlikely that Chu's wrist was broken but it had caused great pain.
An unnamed male protester was seen bleeding from his forehead near the entrance to Sha Tin MTR station after he was apprehended by police and had his hands tied behind his back."

When Richard Scotford learned about the extradition bill protests, he could not help checking his mobile phone every five minutes for the latest news.
He was halfway across the world in Costa Rica, where he moved last year with his wife and daughter to be closer to nature.
""If the protests had happened last year, I wouldn't have left,"" he says. ""My body was in Costa Rica, but my heart was here.""
One day, his wife told him: ""Go back to Hong Kong.""
He bought a plane ticket straight away and returned in early August for 10 days.
""I wanted to support the protests,"" says the 47-year-old Briton, a citizen journalist who contributes to various online media sites in the city.
He is one of a number of ­foreigners who have become familiar faces at protests against the bill, the withdrawal of which was announced this week.
Scotford first set foot in Hong Kong in 1996 as a 24-year-old, fell in love with the city, started an adventure business, got married to a local woman, and settled down. They moved to Central America last year with their eight-year-old daughter.
He was a regular at the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests, which shut parts of the city for 79 days. That made a lasting impression, especially when protesters were tear-gassed in Admiralty.
While in Hong Kong last month, he attended every protest and was often seen on the front lines in his yellow press vest.
Clashes between protesters and police have became increasingly violent, leading to huge numbers of arrests and multiple injuries, some severe.
Some radical demonstrators have hurled bricks at officers and police stations, started fires, thrown petrol bombs, blocked roads, and vandalised facilities such as those inside MTR stations and at the Cross-Harbour Tunnel.
Police have also stepped up their use of force, regularly using tear gas and pepper spray.
Scotford has witnessed some of the clashes. He was in Tsim Sha Tsui on August 11, when a young woman near him was injured in the right eye, allegedly by a police beanbag round.
Demonstrators had besieged the local police station for hours and the shopping area around the compound was like a war zone as officers fired tear gas and beanbag rounds.
""I saw something whizz past my face just before the girl was shot,"" he recalls. 
The young woman's injury made protesters even angrier with police, whom they accused of brutality, and triggered more protests, including those at Hong Kong International Airport. Police are currently conducting an ­investigation.
To compile his reports, Scotford gathers real-time information from social media and relies on Google Translate and speaking to people on the street.
""You have to put in the time to understand, but protesters are keen to explain,"" he says.
Scotford, who has since ­returned to Costa Rica, says: ""I wanted to tell the story of the ­protesters.""
His Facebook page has more than 50,000 followers, a far cry from the days in 2015 when he typically received about 300 likes for posts.
German IT professional Leo Weese, 29, who moved to Hong Kong seven years ago, was among the 1.7 million people who organisers estimated marched peacefully in heavy rain from Victoria Park on August 18.
""Everyone here wants to make a difference,"" he says.
Despite the escalation of ­violence, he says: ""Having lived in Europe, the protests [in Hong Kong] are still very tame.""
Weese finds Hong Kong unique, from the fish balls to the freedom, the free access to the internet and civic society. He has been active in pro-democracy protests since 2012 and spreads the news of political developments via Twitter, podcasts and other social media.
""Hong Kong is my home. I'm going to fight for it. But if one day I find myself in court for protesting, I'll have to leave,"" he says. Until then, however, he says this is where his roots are.
""My friends and work are here. I am not an expat, I am a Hongkonger.""
Australian teacher Jennifer ­Eagleton, 59, arrived in 1997 and got active in pro-democracy ­protests the very next year. Describing her affinity for the city, she says: ""I don't use the term 'expat', which is someone who only lives here temporarily. I call myself an Australian Hongkonger.""
She has attended marches, helping to translate protest ­material and writing articles to spread news of the protests.
""People feel their government ignores ordinary people,"" she says. ""They assume they are not being listened to, but only Beijing is being listened to.""
A committee member of public policy think tank the Hong Kong Democratic Foundation and a member of the pro-democracy Civic Party, Eagleton says that over the past two decades she has noticed Beijing's grip tighten, with the erosion of the city's ­freedoms.
""I don't censor myself because my views are already out on the internet. If I start being afraid of what I say, I think that's the end,"" she says, adding that she believes Hong Kong remains largely a safe place to live in.
Tom Martin was with the ­police force in Australia before moving to Hong Kong with his wife five years ago.
He says he joined the protests to support Hongkongers and ­express unhappiness with what he thinks is excessive use of force by police.
Martin thinks the escalation in violence is confined to a minority among the millions who protest peacefully, and has been in response to the actions of police.
""Every time I think the protests have gone too far, the Hong Kong police do something horrific, which only serves to further strengthen public support for the protests,"" Martin says.
He and his wife were in their flat on Hong Kong Island one day when tear gas fired at protesters outside seeped inside. He went to the local police station to ­complain, but to little effect. Some officers listened, others were ­indifferent, he says.
He joined the estimated 2 ­million people who took to the streets on June 16. (Police figures for the turnout were lower.)
""It would be selfish of me, a foreigner, to enjoy the fruits of the city Hongkongers have created and welcomed me to, if I were not prepared to support them in maintaining their identity,"" he says.
James, 27, a British primary schoolteacher and environmental volunteer, was drawn to the ­action on the street for a different reason. He was touched after ­observing protesters endure sweltering weather but was dismayed by the amount of litter left behind.
The June 9 march, which drew an estimated 1 million people, left a huge mess that needed cleaning up. For the protest a week later James and other volunteers set up a recycling station, and collected about 2,000 plastic bottles in the space of three hours.
He noticed the streets were much cleaner that day despite the even bigger turnout, thanks also to the many volunteers who helped to pick up litter.
""Hongkongers are amazing, in terms of both looking after the environment and telling the government how they feel,"" he says."
South China Morning Post,2019-10-10,protests a 'risk' for city's rated companies S&P Global Ratings says most of the HK firms it tracks,775 ,"
Hong Kong's rated companies have strong financial foundations, but the continuing protests present risks and unprecedented challenges for firms operating in the city, according to S&P Global Ratings.
Of the companies rated by S&P, most are ""fairly ­resilient"" to current volatility ­associated with the protests, with moderate to minimal exposure to highly ­affected sectors, such as hotels, high-end retail and tourist retail, the credit-rating agency said in a report yesterday.
""Operational costs and risks will likely stay elevated in the face of protests, with companies potentially absorbing the costs of damaged property, dents to brand reputation, or heightened regulation. Companies are ­finding themselves in unfamiliar territories of increasing complex sensitivities that could lead to ­unpredictable event risks,"" S&P said.
Infrastructure and transport firms such as MTR ­Corporation faced more immediate risks ­because they were more directly exposed to the ­demonstrations, the report warned.
The protests and unrest began in June over a controversial ­extradition bill that would have made it easier to send criminal suspects to the mainland for trial, but have evolved into a broader series of issues, including income inequality, affordable housing and the growing influence of the mainland on Hong Kong.
The latest IHS Markit Hong Kong purchasing managers' ­index found that the city's private-sector economy remained in a sharp downturn, as the effects of the US-China trade war and ­political unrest continued to dampen demand last month.
Average PMI stood at 42 in the third quarter, the lowest level since the first quarter of 2009, IHS Markit said. A rating above 50 ­represents an expansion when compared with the prior period.
The unrest - marked by ­increasingly violent clashes ­between more radical demonstrators and the police - has pushed the economy to the verge of a technical recession, with some economists predicting it could contract this year.
For the moment, the government is predicting zero to 1 per cent gross domestic product growth for this year.
""Other survey indicators ­suggest the economic ­malaise is unlikely to subside any time soon, as pessimism spreads to more firms,"" said Bernard Aw, principal economist at IHS ­Markit. ­""Business expectations on the year-ahead outlook sank to their lowest for seven-and-a-half years.""
Within S&P's ratings portfolio, real estate and infrastructure companies were the most likely to feel the effects of the protests, ­followed by conglomerates and utilities, the ratings agency said.
""Infrastructure companies may be more directly affected in the short term with disruptions to services and lower traffic ­volume,"" S&P said. ""However, as the protests roll on, the impact to real estate may be larger, with business and consumer confidence waning. That said, for rated real estate and infrastructure companies, we believe the impact to be manageable in the near term.""
Most property leasing and rental companies had a ""well-balanced"" portfolio across office, ­retail, hotels and residential ­development, S&P said.
The effects on infrastructure companies, such as MTR Corp and the Airport Authority, were ""more direct and bigger"" in the near term with declining passenger traffic and lower ability to charge higher rents in their ­commercial segments. The MTR has been a frequent target for ­vandalism by more radical ­protesters and demonstrations at the airport have disrupted traffic and caused the Airport Express train service to shut down.
""If the protests and vandalism continue, their stand-alone credit profiles may be strained unless they scale back or delay large projects,"" S&P said.
""However, we continue to see a high likelihood of extraordinary support from the Hong Kong government due to the entities' critical importance as Hong Kong's largest public transport operator and strategic role as the regional aviation hub.""
Tourism, hospitality and retail businesses have been the hardest hit by the protests, but S&P ­expected the effects on the city's rated firms to be manageable.
For example, Cathay Pacific Airways saw an 11.3 per cent drop in passenger numbers in August. However, the effects on its parent, Swire Pacific, are likely to be ­manageable given its diversified operations, S&P said.
""The combination of complex external uncertainties and ­internal conflicts could challenge even the best run company,"" S&P said. ""As protests continue, the impact will be more sharply ­reflected in rising unemployment and slipping consumer and business confidence ... rated Hong Kong companies may need to find a new gear and transform in the face of such challenges."""
South China Morning Post,2019-11-22,Peaceful protests mark second day of relative calm Police siege of PolyU edges closer to an end as m,807 ,"
Hong Kong enjoyed a second consecutive day of relative calmas protests remained mostly peaceful, while the government pledged temporary free use of the Cross-Harbour Tunnel soon, with both moves seen as conciliatory gestures ahead of district council elections on Sunday.
Last night, the police siege at Polytechnic University appeared to be edging closer to an end as more than 20 protesters left the campus, leaving dozens of diehards still holed up at the site where ­radicals and riot police clashed violently last Sunday.
Since police surrounded the Hung Hom campus, which sits next to the tunnel, about 1,000 people have already walked out through checkpoints. Among them, roughly 300 were aged ­below 18, They had their personal information recorded by the ­police before being allowed to go home. The rest were arrested.
Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said the ­tunnel toll booths had been ""completely destroyed"" and had to be ""almost entirely rebuilt"". It would also take time to repair the electronic equipment, he added.
""But there is no reason to not resume service just because of the problems with the booths,"" he said.
The government could stop charging fees temporarily once it was safe to reopen the tunnel, he added. Tolls range from HK$8 to HK$30.
Yesterday morning, only a small number of protesters ­responded to online calls to ­""paralyse"" the city by disrupting road traffic and rail services.
At the Central business district, about 300 people gathered during lunchtime at the atrium of the International Financial ­Centre mall to show support for those holed up inside PolyU.
""I came out to help keep the spirit of the movement alive,"" Bella, 26, who works in the financial industry, said.
""I did not think it was a smart move to get inside PolyU in the first place, but now that we've got to this stage we'll provide all the support we can.""
The turnout at Central was much smaller than at its peak last week, when thousands gathered on the streets for successive days .
In the evening, several ­hundreds protesters staged a sit-in ­inside the YOHO Mall in Yueb Long to mark four months since a mob stormed into the nearby MTR ­station and indiscriminately ­attacked people with sticks and iron rods. Protesters were angry police took a long time to arrive and when they did, the attackers had already fled.
Among those present then was Martin Chan, a civil servant who has attended a protest on the 21st of every month since the attack.
""I still remember how police abandoned Yuen Long residents who were under attack. They only reappeared 39 minutes later,"" he said, adding he did not fear being arrested for taking part in an ­unauthorised assembly.
Eve Wong, 14, was also at the sit-in but said he told his family he was out with his friends.
""I just wanted to come here to support the movement and do my share,"" he said.
At about 8.45pm, a crowd of more than 100 protesters started to march from the mall onto the main roads of Yuen Long but riot police showed up and urged them to keep to the pavements. Some responded by hurling abuse at the officers but nothing more came of the stand-off and protesters ­dispersed ­before 10pm.
On social media, there were calls for protesters not to block roads on Sunday and the days ­before for fear they could be arrested and thus be unable to vote. Officials have also appealed to protesters not to paralyse public transport to allow the elections to take place.
The elections are widely seen as a de facto referendum on the government and the results would be a gauge on the level of support enjoyed by the protest movement.
At PolyU, many diehard protesters were hiding from public view to rest. A black-clad protester, who said he was under 18, missed home badly.
Under a deal reached by ­education figures and police, anyone aged below 18 could go home after officers recorded their ­personal information. But the ­police could still pursue criminal charges in the future.
""I can't take any chances of having my name taken,"" the black-clad protester said, adding he did not want to have a criminal record.
Another protester, in his early 20s, was still looking for a way to avoid capture on his seventh day at PolyU. He said he neither understood nor cared about ­politics before the protest movement erupted in June. But he soon realised ""nothing much can be achieved through peaceful means"".
PolyU vice-president Alex Wai Ping-kong said he did not know how many people remained ­inside the campus.
""We know that some of those who stayed had diarrhoea and stomach aches and were taken away by ambulances,"" Wai said.
Separately, Chinese University confirmed that its vice chancellor, Rocky Tuan Sung-chi, had been admitted to hospital.
""Professor Tuan is ill and he is taking a rest and is recovering,"" a university spokesman said.

South China Morning Post,2019-06-22,protesters use siege tactics to keep up pressure on lam Demonstrators trap police and civil servants,955 ,"
Thousands of mostly young ­protesters took over Hong Kong's main roads yesterday in an ­unprecedented protest against the ­now-suspended extradition bill, besieging police headquarters and government buildings by using tactics adapted from ­legendary martial artist Bruce Lee's ""be water"" philosophy.
Demanding the complete withdrawal of the bill and exoneration of protesters arrested during previous clashes, they trapped police inside their Wan Chai headquarters for the entire day and into the night, pelting the building with eggs while officers retreated inside and made no attempt to disperse them.
They began in the morning by spilling out into Harcourt Road at the city's administrative andlegislative centre, which was closed for the day because ofsecurity concerns, then moved on to Gloucester Road and Arsenal Street to trap police in their offices and besiege civil servants inRevenue Tower and Immigration Tower in the afternoon.
Splinter groups spread tothe Queensway GovernmentOffices, but upon finding the compound closed for business, they regrouped with the main body of protesters to continue the siege of police headquarters into the night.
Using an effective combination of text messaging and word of mouth on the ground to communicate and mobilise, they kept their actions peaceful, their strategy based on Bruce Lee's famous quote about adaptability: ""Water can flow or it can crash; be water, my friend.""
There was no sign of Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng ­Yuet-ngor, or her top officials throughout the day, but the government issued a statement at night spelling out the disruptions to public services and transport caused by the protesters.
""The protests today caused much inconvenience to the community by disrupting traffic and many public services ... dozens of 999 emergency calls could not be dealt with immediately. More than 100 bus and minibus routes were diverted or suspended,"" a spokesman said.
He also reiterated that the government had completely stopped work on the bill, which would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to the mainland and other jurisdictions with which the city has no extradition deal.
""The current term of the Legislative Council will end in July next year, after which the bill will automatically lapse. The government accepts this reality,"" he said.
While protesters were out in the streets demanding government officials face them, the health and civil service ministers were the only ones to speak about public hospitals passing information on previously injured protesters to police, and the closure of public offices affected by the sieges.
Religious leaders have been sympathetic towards the protest movement, but the seeming lack of an end game and uncertainty over how far protesters are prepared to go has started to cause some anxiety among them.
Catholic Auxiliary Bishop ­Joseph Ha Chi-shing issued a ­video message calling for calm and expressing fears over the safety of youngsters on the streets.
""You have been in the streets for a very long time, done a lot of things, and you have stated your demands very clearly,"" he said. ""I hope your struggle will not affect the mass of ordinary people, otherwise public opinion can sway [against you].""
Lam ended her campaign to bulldoze the extradition bill through the legislature and made a personal apology after anestimated 2 million Hongkongers took to the streets on June 16 to oppose it.
That was not enough to pacify many who were angered by her refusal to scrap the bill and a police crackdown on protesters trying to storm the Legco compound on June 12 who were beaten back with tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds. More than 80 were injured in the clashes.
The protesters returned to the streets after yesterday's deadline passed for Lam to meet four demands: withdraw the bill; exonerate those arrested earlier; retract all references to the protest on June 12 as a ""riot""; and punish police officers who used excessive force that day.
Daniel Yiu, a 19-year-oldprotester returning home for his summer break while studying in London, said he was glad to see no violence so far this time.
""It's good to see both sidesactually not struggling, both sides standing their ground. Us protesting peacefully and police not ­doing a lot, standing there, not using any violence to get rid of us,"" he said.
Protesters outside police headquarters used umbrellas to block CCTV cameras on the walls of the building, and moved ­barricades to block its entrances.
Traffic in Wan Chai and Admiralty came to almost a complete standstill at one stage, with protesters simultaneously occupying parts of Gloucester Road, Queensway and Hennessy Road.
At Revenue Tower earlier, dozens of people trying to hand in tax forms and other documents were turned away by security guards.
Piling more pressure on the government, the Bar Association called for a top-level investigation into police guidelines on use of force against protesters, while the Civil Human Rights Front, organiser of the two mass rallies, announced plans for another major protest in Central on Wednesday.
The next protest would be aimed at ramping up pressure on Lam ahead of the Group of 20 leaders' summit in Osaka, during which President Xi Jinping is expected to meet his US counterpart, Donald Trump.
Protesters yesterday were further antagonised by pro-establishment lawmaker Ann Chiang Lai-wan, who suggested the government should reintroduce the bill in a couple of months after a major publicity campaign to win public support.
The government was quick to distance itself from her suggestion, as was her party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, which clarified that Chiang was speaking for herself.

South China Morning Post,2019-10-29,Speak your mind on protests - if you dare MY TAKE,425 ,"
It's hard to say anything publicly about the protests without being heckled or harassed these days. It's not just in Hong Kong but in Australia, Canada and the United States, where there are substantial numbers of students from the city and the mainland.
That has been the experience this month of Edward Steinfeld - a China specialist and director of the Thomas J. Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University - who offered a politically neutral analysis of the background to the protests at a lecture, according to the Brown Daily Herald.
There have been many reported incidents of confrontation between mainland and Hong Kong students overseas in the Western news media. However, the narrative almost always portrays Hong Kong people involved as civil and reasonable and mainlanders as nationalistic hotheads and blowhards.
It's rather different if you read the newspapers or news sites of the colleges and universities, where far more nuanced discussions and debates are reported.
Rather than offering support for the protesters, as Western political correctness requires these days, Steinfeld didn't take sides, and so was taken to task and denounced as a communist stooge in the pay of the Chinese government.
Interestingly, in yet another news report about nationalistic Chinese students making threats on Western campuses, The New York Times mistakenly turned the whole incident around. The people in the audience who heckled Steinfeld were reported to be accusing the professor of ""bias towards the Communist Party"".
""During family weekend this month at Brown University,"" the Times report said, ""an alumnus and a student confronted a professor at his lecture on the protests, accusing him of bias toward the Communist Party of China and suggesting that he was bankrolled by Chinese political groups.""
In fact, according to the Herald, the ""Hong Kong-born alum accused Steinfeld of being biased because he felt that Steinfeld's presentation included talking points of the Chinese Communist Party"".
The alumnus also suggested ""Steinfeld might be receiving funding from the United Front, a coalition of political parties led by the Communist Party"", a charge Steinfeld denied.
A current graduate student wearing a surgical mask and sunglasses then took the microphone and demanded Steinfeld declare his position on the removal of protest posters on the university campus.
That's fairly standard behaviour of ""yellow-ribbon"" crowds, though rarely acknowledged in Western media. This one got through because it was misreported."
